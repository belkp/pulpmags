We work in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">department. Our salaries, as long as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure up to a certain standard of effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciency, is an even hundred dollars a</seg><seg type="columnLine">month. But if a slight defect should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered in us, any two of a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">other small cogs, temporarily held in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve, will automatically replace us. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">will fit in the wheel as well as we did at</seg><seg type="columnLine">our best. Of course, I realized that long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. but it never troubled me to any ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent. I don't believe in brooding over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the future. Besides, until day before</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday, I've managed to steer clear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spending money except for books and</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessities, and I've a comfortable little</seg><seg type="columnLine">sum laid by for a rainy day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You read a great deal." said Baldwin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after he had helped himself to one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigars.

What do you do when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't read? Why don't you wake up?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">What he said sounded like an echo</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my conscience.

Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I was positive that I possessed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualities essential for genuine friendship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew of no man whom I could call my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend.

Her large brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes sparkled with a sort of devilish mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief that got on my nerves, and she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way of tilting her head and looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on me that made me feel smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">as compared to her than really was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case. 1 judged that she had left the pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic school eight or ten years ago, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon impressed that she had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable more experience in the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">training school than I. She was well and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly dressed, and struck me as being</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kind of girl who could make a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle go a long way. And she was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">concertingly pretty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baldwin called the other girl Gertie</seg><seg type="columnLine">--her surname I failed to catch at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduction. She seemed of a pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant disposition, but I didn't like her</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh. Nor did I like Miss Muriel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh. I had a feeling all the time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides the trirles that so amused them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw something extremely jolly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation, which I failed to see. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was a little put out on that account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It developed that the girls hadn't had</seg><seg type="columnLine">their dinner, that, in fact, as a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, they were looking to us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy their dinner. I had come prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spend a dollar, loafing over a glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of beer, but I soon realized that it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be that way. Miss Muriel looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from the wine card, and said to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiter, whom she seemed to know:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll start with a Martini cocktail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Port wine for mine," said Gertie, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">also seemed to know the waiter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the way Miss Muriel studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the menu I knew that she was deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to get my money's worth. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined the list of food as a discrimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nating person would examine a list of</seg><seg type="columnLine">books. Such a person. I've noticed, will</seg><seg type="columnLine">run his finger down the list of authors--</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the right-hand side--and when his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye alights on the name of some literary</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius, then he will look at the titles at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left-hand side. Miss Muriel had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a similar method of choosing her dinner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were all kinds of prices, from ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">cents up to two dollars, but her finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not hesitate a fraction of a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOFE-STORY OF A HUMAN COG</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on any of the small figures. It stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the two-dollar figure, then it made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift rectangular motion to the left, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly she knew what she was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have for dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ain't you going to have anything?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked me. after she had ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about three dollars' worth of food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I told her I had had my dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have a sandwich, anyway/' she in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vited, smiling generously. ''For com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany's sake/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, take a sandwich,*' said Bald-</seg><seg type="columnLine">win. who had ordered some kind of gou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So T asked the waiter to bring me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheese sandwich and a pot of tea. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they all lost control of themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I failed to see the humor in the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and told them so.- Couldn't a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">order a cheese sandwich and a pot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tea without being laughed at ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon me." said Miss Muriel, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had recovered part of her breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but you looked so funny ordering that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheese sandwich and that--pot--of--</seg><seg type="columnLine">tea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, I am mentally neither deaf nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumb. I am as intelligent as the aver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age person, and I do believe I am slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly more so than Baldwin. I knew what</seg><seg type="columnLine">made them laugh. When a man is out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his element he doesn't appear to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage; he may even act as a fool. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose I had behaved like some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clown without intending it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Muriel was kind enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change the subject. She told me she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone without lunch in anticipation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this princely spread, and T could well be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve her, for she seemed to be rein-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcing herself against a lunchless to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow. I didn't mind that so much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut I did object to the frequent cock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails. Ry looking at the wine list I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they cost forty cents apiece, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">within an hour and a half she did away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with three of them. It seemed to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reckless way of spending the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man she had not known for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours. It certainly wasn't polite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I tried to make her see it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They might go to your head," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I like them," she replied, looking at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me mockingly. "Why don't you try one</seg><seg type="columnLine">--they're good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am glad you like them," I lied. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of to-morrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bother!" said she. "They don't hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Maybe you don't like this place so</seg><seg type="columnLine">very well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I guess it's all right," I replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">evasively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure! It's all right, or you wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">find me here. - I come here quite often</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a good friend of mine; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed out to-night. I guess he had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment with another girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was quiet for a space, gazing away</seg><seg type="columnLine">wistfully toward a gay crowd of ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently wayward young people of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper class. Then she expressed a wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another of the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you think it is right." I said hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right as long as you don't mix</seg><seg type="columnLine">them." she instructed me. "Don't ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry about me. W ipe your chin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull down your vest--you're in a worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">state than I am." She pushed 'the bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the waiter, then leaned toward me</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidentially: "Did you ever hear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poor babes that got themselves lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the woods?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't," I answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, it's a sad, sad story. I'll tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to you, some time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to think of some repartee, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as nothing appropriate occurred to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought better of it, and changed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do your parents live in this city, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ward?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," she replied, sobering a little. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">left them home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is your home, may I ask?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where I hang my hat," she answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifferently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was hardly witty, I thought, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently she wished to avoid serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation. If there is anything I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">an absolute failure at, it is in this jolly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing small talk that seems lo cost most</seg><seg type="columnLine">people no effort at all. Baldwin is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expert at it. Between him and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls, they kept it up all the evening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They must have uttered enough non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense to fill a good-sized hook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stayed in the Icarus until about</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BREEZY STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">closing time. When it came to settling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it gave me quite a shock to learn that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bill had crept up to fifteen dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sixty cents. Baldwin asked me in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an undertone to pay the entire amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">--he would settle with me later. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked "piker-like," he argued, to split</seg><seg type="columnLine">it between us in the restaurant. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know Baldwin, and I made him pay his</seg><seg type="columnLine">share right there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside the Icarus we were assaulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a score or so of parasite taxidrivers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one of whom seemed to be as sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he was of breakfast, that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going for a midnight joyride and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only undecided as to which taxi to em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploy. Miss Muriel placed a meditative</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger on her underlip and looked them</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. Then she looked at me and smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewitchingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wouldn't it be nicer* she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right here, ladies; right here, gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men/' cried the most energetic of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabmen, and took hold of me. I tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake him off. but he wouldn't let go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was looking respectfully at Miss Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riel. as though she were the mistress of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole show.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But just then Fate stepped in, or per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps it wasn't so much Fate, after all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think that Nellis, knowing where to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find her, must have been waiting out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side for Miss Muriel. Nellis is a slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly bigger and more important cog than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am. We have known each other for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several years, but beyond an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hello!" in the office, where I see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day. we are as good as strangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one another. We don't mix. He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">more like Baldwin. And he is a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some fellow, tall and graceful and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguished looking than most cogs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment Miss Muriel saw him she</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot all about the taxi. The coaxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">look went out of her brown eyes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into them came a new expression which</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow I wished had been for me. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to look angry, but she didn't suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a nice one." she said to Nel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know it," Nellis laughed. "Hello,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oliver, old top." he hailed me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had a good time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Muriel gave me no time to an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">swer. In fact, as far as she was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned, I had ceased to exist. She tugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his sleeve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why couldn't you comer''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you I had an important en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gagement," said Nellis carelessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You didn't want to." By this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had her hand on his arm in a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">that showed plainly that she claimed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her escort; and, actually, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to walk away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baldwin, who was a little ahead with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gertie, turned, and beheld me standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. I am still, wondering what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aren't you coming, Oliver Y* he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was going to blurt: "Not as a fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel,' but the grins and stares of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty taxidrivers checked me. So I</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " No, not to-night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hearing my voice, Miss Muriel seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to recall me. She turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, aren't you?" she cried, affecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">great disappointment. "Well, thank you ..</seg><seg type="columnLine">for to-night, Mr. Oliver. By-by!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nellis came over to my desk the fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing afternoon. He addressed me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual cordiality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was a mean, rotten treatment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muriel gave you last night. But don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame me, Oliver.

I said. "I am sorry</seg><seg type="columnLine">I butted in; I had no idea that you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she kept company."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh--as for that." He leaned leisure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly against my desk, regardless of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief clerk \yho was just passing.

"Muriel is</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to me," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She is a bit of a luxury, isn't she?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I ventured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not when she is with me," he as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted.

The restaurant is spacious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful, and I like to spend an hour or</seg><seg type="columnLine">so in it, readine my paper over a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond cup of coffee. They have an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent cook: their flapjacks are uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monly good, and yon get real maple</seg><seg type="columnLine">syrup with them, all for fifteen cents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now. it so happens that Muriel and Ger-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tie live within a block of Alexander's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they, too, have a weakness for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flapjacks. But, of cours'e, until I unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectedly faced them upon entering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">restaurant last Sunday morning, 1 had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no idea that they would be there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, what could a man do? They</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught sight of me before I saw them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or 1 should have turned and fled. Mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riel flashed a smile at me, and indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the empty chair at her side. Now, il</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had possessed a modicum of gump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion I should have ignored the invita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion--she deserved it--hut evidently she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it wasn't in me to decline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, I tried to act as though tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing breakfast with two attractive girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an experience in which I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">no particular charm, though I have mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">givings that the tone of easy familiarity</seg><seg type="columnLine">I assumed impressed them as genuine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps I overdid it. It was one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">few pleasures, I told them, to read my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday paper over a second cup of cof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fee in this cheerful place. Now, I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed.

There have been oc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">casions, on rainy days or early in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">morning, when I have enjoyed a lonely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stroll in this park, and more than once,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">during my silent wanderings, did I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a sweet vision of some one stepping light-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly at my side, some one sympathetic and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">understanding, her hand in mine beneath</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the bowers of a long sequestered path,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and both of us wishing for no other com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">panion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Muriel could never be such a com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">panion ; Gertie far, far less.

She had the jitney stop outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alexander's restaurant, and after we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">alighted, she said : "Well, come on, hoys</seg><seg type="columnLine">and girls, it's time for lunch." But she</seg><seg type="columnLine">never meant that the treat should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. her. #</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muriel disappeared up the steps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telephone building an hour later, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she remained in my thoughts long after.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had planned the day before to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sunday in the usual quiet way, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had provided myself with a copy of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket edition of "The Light That</seg><seg type="columnLine">Failed," but Kipling proved a lifeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion that afternoon. I told my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self that I was a fool to think of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl; if she was too wise for Nellis, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly would prove so in my case.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As long as she suggested no other treats</seg><seg type="columnLine">than jitney rides and inexpensive walks</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the park, there was no danger of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing about my ruin; but I certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew the line at dinners at the Icarus</seg><seg type="columnLine">and joyrides. Besides, it is plain as day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that she is in love with Nellis, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely regards me as a sort of queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutt who can't possibly arouse the jeal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ousy of any one and will come in handy</seg><seg type="columnLine">once in a while to foot the bill when</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is nobody else around to do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had given me her telephone num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber and asked me to call her up. and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given her mine.

A walking race! The very</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea! What would her mother think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it- Good-night! She was very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid I wanted to take her at a sixty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile clip along the smooth oily road</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led straight to perdition. My pacc</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far too fast for her. Now, if I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested a little dinner party at that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">delightful cabaret place, I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested something within reason; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I could talk Mr. Baldwin over into</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking Gertie, the girls would have any</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening oil after eight.

In her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes I read that at the moment she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Muriel 1 loved, and I wished that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day, with its benevolent influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her, would last forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After an energetic but futile attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to empty the two lunch baskets, we spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a delightful hour basking in the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Then Gertie announced that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ^oing to take a nap, and*while Bald-</seg><seg type="columnLine">win improvised a pillow from the Sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day newspapers we had brought with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, Muriel and I slipped away among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barnacled boulders. Alone with her,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt a little tongue-tied, and her re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks were mainly confined to excla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mations such as: "Look at this!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look at that!" There were many in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting things to look at, sea-shells and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea-stars and seaweeds, and something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had the appearance of a petrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOVE-STORY OF A HUMAN COG	15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sack of cement. And we would stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">with heads close together, while I en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavored to lecture on the objects we</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined, though precious little did I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the reckless girl began moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain-climbing feats among the boulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as her high-heeled boots were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">adapted for quick motion on the irregu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar ground, I feared that she might stum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble and hurt herself. Presently, in leap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from one rock to another, she slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the seaweed, but happily no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage resulted than a broken French</seg><seg type="columnLine">heel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-night!" was her cry of dismay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Got any glue about you, Mr. Oliver?**</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I seated myself beside her, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prolonged examination of the broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">heel, diagnosed that if she did no fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther cavortings. it might stay on until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we got back to the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another, expense!" she sighed--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought with a hint tlsat the bill for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">repair of the boot ought to be included</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the general excursion expenses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she made a new discovery. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">it happened was a mystery to her, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had broken her brooch. It wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of a brooch, she admitted, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she valued it highly because it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to her by a very good friend a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of years ago. She sure did ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciate little things like that, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from a good friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There you go again,*' I scolded her</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently.

There could be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake about it--I knew only too well</seg><seg type="columnLine">the well-built, graceful and smartly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed figure. On the narrow trestle</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the tidelands, along which the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursionists were walking toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore, I beheld the man who, I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the moment was in Muriel's thoughts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nellis had been on that boat, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite likely that we would meet him</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we left Minerva Beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From appearances he had no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion than a lean, pipe-smoking per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son in whose company 1 had often seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">him--a chartered accountant, I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is. I did not make my discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, and I hoped that his arrival had</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped Gertie and Baldwin, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices I heard a short distance away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a possibility that Nellis would</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the beach in the opposite direc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from the course we had taken, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we left on an earlier boat, a meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him might be avoided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muriel's tears did not last long.

But it was too late. Muriel's curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity had been aroused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could see how the sight of Nellis</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOVE-STORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">agitated her. She stood motionless for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, as if undecided whether to</seg><seg type="columnLine">step behind the boulder or remain where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could not help being observed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Even as she appeared to make up</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mind to stay out of sight,.Nellis saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, hello, Muriel!" he hailed, wav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his hat. Then he and his friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up to us. "Hello, Gertie! Hello,</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody! Where's your chaperon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls?" he bantered. "The idea of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">going picnicking without asking me</seg><seg type="columnLine">along!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He introduced his friend. I was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">put out by the intrusion that, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">T caught the name, I wouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known it a minute later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, sit down and have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunch," Gertie invited. "You don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you have been missing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," Nellis returned, his eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muriel with a peculiar intensity that</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested that until this moment he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never really valued the girl as she ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be valued. "It appears that I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That his remark had no reference to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lunch was clear to all of us. Bald-</seg><seg type="columnLine">win scowled behind his back. Muriel</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently failed to appreciate his veiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">flattery. and. it pleased me to notice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to resent it when he seated him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self beside her. If she had bestowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me a similar look of strong dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">approval. it would have tied my awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward tongue altogether, but it failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">freeze Nellis. From appearances he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">for granted that he had a perfect right</seg><seg type="columnLine">to monopolize her. and, I must say, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it with good effect. It wasn't long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the ice was melted, and that ac-=</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished, the scornful expression in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes soon gave way to a look that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made my heart ache with bitterness, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">just so had I wished that she should look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a little while the conversation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer general. Nellis lowered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice to a soft purr when he spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Muriel, and presently she responded</seg><seg type="columnLine">either in the same confidential murmur</seg><seg type="columnLine">or with laughing monosyllableBald-</seg><seg type="columnLine">win and Gertie began airurmg them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves with tossing pebbles at an empty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF A HUMAN* COG	17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle, and Nellis' friend tried to get me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discuss the European war. The ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">daverous chap, whatever his name was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be an insufferable bore. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the time, while he was talking, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was helping himself to the very best of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leavings of our expensive lunch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I thought the situation over, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretending to be listening to a pro-Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man opinion of the Russians, it came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that Nellis was playing on a presump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that his "pull" in the office would</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent any demonstration on my part</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of arousing his displeasure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, he was wrong in that--I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave much thought to his superior po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition other than I Would like to have it</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nellis stood up and helped Muriel to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feet. He might have let go of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">after she stood upright, but he kept sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porting her as though he was giving her</seg><seg type="columnLine">a walking-lesson. It may be chivalrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">to act that way toward a young and</seg><seg type="columnLine">healthy woman. I don't know. I only</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that it would have given me im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense relief if I had shouted at him:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hands off!" I am glad now I didn't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll just take a little stroll along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach," said Muriel, with an apolo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getic look at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry about us, old man," Nel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lis added patronizingly, "if we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss the boat you go on, we'll take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next one home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even now, in a cooler moment, I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that I had every excuse for acting</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I did.

I shan't deny that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to feel uncomfortable.

Very decent he looked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks to Hsing Chi; and, the dependent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and dependable chaperon being dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed, they had a most pleasant talk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the places and people they both knew\</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eventually, Foster never knew how, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had promised to come and see her. WTiat</seg><seg type="columnLine">is more, he came, and came again. Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allen's hostess was aghast, the commu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity was shocked. But what cared they,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the infra-man and the super-woman?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came again, and yet again. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were walks and rides and billiards and</seg><seg type="columnLine">singles on the private court. Then, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, it happened, and kisses were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed and the old heavy seal ring left</seg><seg type="columnLine">his little finger. Incidentally there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">confessions followed by swift forgive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, the injunction to "never do ifi</seg><seg type="columnLine">again,'' and his removal to the Port's</seg><seg type="columnLine">apology for an hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hsing Chi was too much wrapped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her approaching triumph to notice any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing at first. True that Fa, her lord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out occasionally; but that was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own good pleasure and as such to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">respected. True also that certain of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own sex and race made insinuations ; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were merely envious. Besides, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">manlike to lapse occasionally and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was That which would bring him tjack</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the crash, intensified by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">appalling suddenness. An old harridan</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled to her across the mud wall that</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fa, the outsider, has left you, shameless</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, to go with the tall foreign woman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Loyal Hsing Chi did not believe it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fa, her lord, would return soon and give</seg><seg type="columnLine">that East-West the lie. She would wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">and be reassured. She waited one day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days. Oh, the agony of that wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ! Then the zealous neighbor in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed her that "Fa, the outsider, is at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel. Go, sell your goods and return</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your shame to the gutter whence you</seg><seg type="columnLine">came!" Suddenly she felt that it was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She would go to Foster. She w-ent--■</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was turned away. Distracted, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to the little red house. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">could she do ? Slowly her meagre intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence revolved the possible courses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">action. Gradually a final hope was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolved. She would go to see this great</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady and plead with her for her own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Feverishly she donned her best, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">BREEZY STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weird, exotic combination of pinks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">greens and reds. Hastily she arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hair, brushing it with oil until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone and glistened. Then she sped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, though her gait was ever growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">slower, to the Taipan's house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Allen was bored, prettily bored,</seg><seg type="columnLine">daintily bored, but, nonetheless, undeni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably bored. She consulted her little</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch pettishly. Three o'clock, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beneath the dignity of a foreigner</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stir before four-thirty. She permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself the luxury of a yawn. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time in her life she wanted to pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own trunks, anything to occupy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next hour. She longed ardently for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of the free--free to pack their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunks if they so desired.

His face was pale and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands looked thin and blue. He rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked to the box which did service</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a cupboard, and searched its every</seg><seg type="columnLine">crevice. He had done this repeatedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the morning, and as before his</seg><seg type="columnLine">search did not reveal the smallest crumb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Impatiently he threw the tin dishes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor and kicked them out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Again he sat by the stove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a fortnight he had not eaten a</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfying meal, and now for three days</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not tasted a morsel. The state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hunger was becoming acute. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold seemed unendurable in his famished</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition. Yet his only choice was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiver here in his own cabin or loaf</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the saloon farther up the strag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling camp. There the evidence of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few eatables aggravated his misery; be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, the men gathered there more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">half suspected his plight, and their sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathy was not of a sort tending to alle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viate his suffering. Some one might</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer him a drink, but even liquor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too scarce to be lavish of now. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never formed a taste for intoxicants, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a day or two before he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">ottered a drink, he had accepted it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he thought it might bring relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his gnawing appetite. The nausea</seg><seg type="columnLine">which resulted had been so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse than his hunger that he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SQUARE MEAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">F raker</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> no inclination to repeat the experiment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The storm had raged for three weeks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and showed no sign of abating. Many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> among the motley inhabitants of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> camp had hone too much, and others</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> than he were awaiting slow crawling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> starvation. Only two men had anything</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to spare and they made the hungry pay</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> dearly for whatever they got. Only the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> day before Herrick had offered old Peter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Skelton his claim for board till the storm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> should break, but that shrewd old game-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ster replied that the claim was worthless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and that grub was worth too much just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> then to take any chances on. Herrick</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had even reduced his request to a small</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> quantity of provision; still the old man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> refused. This morning he had offered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it for one square meal, but Skelton, who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in ordinary circumstances had been an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ordinary man, was now playing for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fortune out of the sufferings of his fel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> low's, and answered that he had not a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> bean save for the gold in his fist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Herrick's brain seemed whirling with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the eddying snowT. He took a picture</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> from his pocket and looked longingly at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the smiling face. The features wavered,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> grew dim, then slowdy mingled with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> heavy features and dull countenance of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> an Indian face. When again he seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to waken, his hands lay on the cold stove</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> --the fire had gone out.

He could see but two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ossibilities before him; if he remained</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ere, there was no doubt death was not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> far off, and the alternative--he had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> thinking of it for days, always with dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> gust. Either way all was lost. He must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> find some way to justify himself; it wras</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> an expedient which life necessitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buttoning his coat up tightly and pull-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 28</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PRICE OF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his cap low over his eyes, he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the storm that seemed taunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as it shrieked and buffeted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. He went to the saloon hoping to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find some way yet to escape his dilemma.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All was as it had been for days, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same men playing the same game?., the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same men winning, the same men drunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">or drinking.

He strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled about through the snow drifts, till</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely weary, he turned resolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the substantial log house of Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Skelton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was let in by the half-breed wife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who greeted him none too cordially and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him closely through her half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed eyes.

He began some light conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the storm which she answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">dully, never taking her gaze from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. His appetite was growing ram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pant, so though his very soul revolted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he plunged desperately to the purpose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his visit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do not know how lonely it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at my cabin, Maggie," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">dejectedly.

However, his suspicion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not disarmed.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief was so genuine that at first he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost content. Two days after his mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage the storm broke.

He was moody and restless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inwardly he cursed the Irish in Maggie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishing that she possessed the stolid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian disposition of her mother, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she clung to him. lavishing on him a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dumb affection like an uncouth ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal. Her caresses were almost unen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">durable and he daily loathed his posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion more intensely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked forward eagerly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening of spring. It was with real joy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, that he hailed a proposal from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Skelton to make a trip to Juneau. Some'</seg><seg type="columnLine">business demanded his presence there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he wished to bring back a supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">provisions, so he purposed taking Her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rick and a half-breed driver to help him</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the way returning; and if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">chose, they might all go down to Juneau.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To be doing something, to be out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open was unspeakable relief. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet decided what to reply to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawyer's communication, nor had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least thought of escape from his present</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition come to his mind. He had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved to strike out for himself in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">enterprise in the spring and not remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mere puppet of old Peter, but had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not decided what it should be. He in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to fulfill his nominal obligations</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Maggie, though in just what way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not determined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had spent his life among people</seg><seg type="columnLine">who observed the normal ideals of so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciety", and had conformed to them simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a matter of course.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">now recognized bis weakness in giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to his hunger, for what it was, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not realize that his present chafing</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PRICE OF A SQUARE MEAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was because of the same lack of endur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A ship from San Francisco rode at</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchor at the wharf of Juneau. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herrick looked at her a mad desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">run away seemed to overwhelm him. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">night he could hear the soft lapping of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waves; they seemed to be enticing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him away to freedom. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight with himself in his small room, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dressed and went out to walk the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. At length he found himself at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wharf, whither he seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come without his own volition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was dark, but he could see the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle rocking of the white ship. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">p3&gt;scd near him and halted watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Herrick addressed him civilly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon in close conversation with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain of the ship. The tide was in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were making ready to put off. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the life convict leaps for the one chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of possible escape, Herrick grasped this</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity without reflecting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain was very moderate in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">demands, and smuggled him on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. When the captain considerately</seg><seg type="columnLine">died of an over-indubrence in his favor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ite Scotch, the day before they put into</seg><seg type="columnLine">port. Herrick thought himself* fortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, and had small change to tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph for money for the remaining ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penses of his journey from Seattle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once again in his ok! place, among his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own people, the northland seemed only</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unpleasant dream, and he could al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mo~- persuade himself that the ties that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound him there were a mere nightmare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the summer the girl with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair face was away and he hoped she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would wed the other man and save him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from embarrassment, but early in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail she returned. He went to see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to convince himself, he argued with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscience, that she was irrevocably lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. He found her frankly glad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him. more charming and winsome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more wholly to be desired than ever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">i he pain of being near her was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">KTeat, so pleading a business engagement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he soon took his leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He resolved that he would not seek</seg><seg type="columnLine">her company again, and for weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">bravely kept to his purpose. One day</seg><seg type="columnLine">as lie rode toward the country, fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his longing to see her, he met her</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the wayside with her runabout dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abled. He had no choice but to take her</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, ar.d there he lingered, throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his resolution away. Thereafter, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came frequently, always moody and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served, always resolving not to go again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as often breaking his resohe. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hungered for her presence, and. like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunger of his body in the Alaskan</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter, it mastered him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One afternoon they walked down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little gate of the garden and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a while to watch the sun setting far</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the w*ater. She had been silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and preoccupied. Suddenly she raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lovely face to his and spoke slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why do you always come and go</seg><seg type="columnLine">away thus. Alien* You seem &gt;jd when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are w ith me. and not as you used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be.

Why must</seg><seg type="columnLine">this be all we may have?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you love me, it should not be--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not be. If you wish it, I am wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours; for I love you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Herrick wrestled long with his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">science that night; not for the sake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl at the north, not even for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake of the girl he loved, but because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the odium with which the thing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to do was branded. At length</seg><seg type="columnLine">he justified himself: doubtless Maggie</seg><seg type="columnLine">had married again and he was free, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a technical sense. Besides, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always felt that his alliance with her was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bond for which he was hardly respon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible. Still, he knew how the other girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">would regard 'the matter. She might</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgive his marriage: but she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">never forgive his desertion of the obliga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions he had assumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten years go quickly and the north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land had almost vanished from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. One afternoon he found him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">32	BREEZY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">self in a crush caused by some trifling</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident to an electric car. As he edged</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way through, some one lay hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm. Turning, he looked into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrewd eyes of Peter Skelton. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange chances of fortune had-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him thus in a throng, elbow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow with the one man he feared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet and had never expected to encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. Having once found his man, Skel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton was not to be eluded, and Herrick</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared not try to escape him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Herrick tried vainly to buy him off;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the old man had always held a suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cion that Herrick had worked a trick on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him only to get something to eat. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed there were ways in which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could pinch his reluctant son-in-law</seg><seg type="columnLine">tighter than by accepting any amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ransom money. Consequently, he sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly developed a fine standard of honor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and family pride. Maggie had remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithful in spite of all suitors and pater-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal suasion, besides there was a son. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man would hear of no terms that</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not include Herrick's immediate re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to his deserted wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Herrick knew he could expect no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercy from the old man, should the</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence of the woman and three bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">children down by beautiful Monterey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">become known to him. He was able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep this knowledge from him and Skel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton accepted a liberal sum of bills as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">price of his silence, which was rein-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced--or more correctly, enforced--by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herrick's declaring he would never go an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch or pay him a cent if in any way</seg><seg type="columnLine">their relation was divulged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When, two days later. The Sitka</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the bar and turned her prow</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward. Herrick and Peter Skelton</seg><seg type="columnLine">were both on board. Herrick had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to comply with his father-in-law's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishes, as the only means by which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could save those he loved from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shame he had put upon them. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">better bear to pass out of their lives, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved and sorrowed over, than remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lose their esteem. For them, too, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt it the easier way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Skelton realized that Herrick was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more surely his prisoner than if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking him in chains.

He knew well that Herrick was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that his marriage with Maggie</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not hold in court.

He had been so fortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had looked forward to going at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least as far as the coast towns when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter was past. His positive reply this</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening had deepened the wonder in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had come back from his long</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence, she had asked no question.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Time had brought her stoical Indian na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture to dominate any emotional impulses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the most part, she was silent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexpressive. Perhaps, also, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally even duller than in her girl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood. His return had been to her much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the coming of the sun after the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. That he was with her was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough at first, but by little, an unrest, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question grew. He was not happy; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hiding. Why ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was always some barrier be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them which she could not compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hend. Now it was like the clear cold ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the winter. She quickly learned he</seg><seg type="columnLine">preferred she would not touch him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">never save to offer some aid did he ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach her. Yet lie was kind, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">tender in word and act, never vexed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never impatient--she had never imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ined such a man. The men she knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all abusive on occasion, domineer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, demanding to be served. Perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was because he was more truly a demi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">god to her than a man, and her love more</seg><seg type="columnLine">adoration than passion, that she tolerated</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attitude toward her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watching his sad, drawn face as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firelight played over it, the feminine sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly sensed the other woman. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, she sat silent--watching. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stillness, a wail broke from her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wail of the wild, like the notes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian dirge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Herrick, startled, grasped the arms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair and leaned quickly forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking her name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"She is making you unhappy!

Master-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing himself, he rose, and, taking her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands firmly in his own, he spoke sternly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maggie, you do not know what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are saying.

There is plenty of money. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">must go to bed now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She went meekly, like a chidden child.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herrick stood for a while before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. Maggie's outbreak had left him</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed. At length, he took off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PRICE OF A SQUARE MEAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heavier garments, and threw himself on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his couch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had slept long, when he awoke with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeling akin to alarm. Without mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. he opened his eyes. Maggie sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched before the dying fire, her chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting in her hand. He closed his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time she sat there, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came and stood beside his bed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes. She looked down qui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etly at him. No vestige of her emotional</seg><seg type="columnLine">outburst of the evening remained. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in dull, heavy tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," she said, "it's me keeping you</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her. I am breaking your heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I didn't know.

Never in his noblest mood had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered her. In the beginning, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken thought only for himself, and later</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his care had been for the woman he</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered truly his wife. Maggie had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been an encumbrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her outburst bad startled him both</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the intensity of her passion and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard for him. He realized he had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways looked on her much as an uncouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing animal. L'gly, stupid, dull in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind and expression, this had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">revelation of the unselfish devotion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her heart and of what his love meant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His pity for her and his incrimination</seg><seg type="columnLine">of self made this the bitterest night he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had yet known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He soon rose and built a blazing fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to chase away the shadows of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night with its cheering light. Maggie</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, dull and stoical as ever to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form her homely tasks. She cooked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savory meat and prepared mush and hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">biscuit. The steaming coffee was just to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his taste. Herrick found it difficult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe the experience of the night other</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a hallucination. Yet, once when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he raised his eyes, he found her looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him with the look of the suffering</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumb brute in her eyes. The food</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked in his throat and he felt like</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling to her on his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Little Allen was anxious for the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and talked eagerly of its prospect, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">noting the silence of his companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're not going out to-day, son,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Herrick said.

A crackling of crust, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding of a mass of snow, and dogs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver went hurtling over the precipice</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ice below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Herrick placed the poor crumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">body on the sledge and hastened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin, where he gave such first aid as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could.

His face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep-lined, had a look of resolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">which bore evidence of suffering, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shame. A little cry of pain rose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lips, but did not escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither spoke, but with eyes looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep into hers, he crossed the room, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted a few feet from her, his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded on his breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have come as quickly as I could,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, in a voice slightly husky, "to</seg><seg type="columnLine">place my love and the way of my life in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hands.

However false this may be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some women, it was true of Dolly Ryan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as she was able to reason about</seg><seg type="columnLine">such matters, she decided that she be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to the class of women to whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">love is practically everything; or per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps it would be better'to say that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">belonged to the class of women who</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit that love is everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having made this important discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">as early as her seventeenth year, Dolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">candidly proceeded to educate herself for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the responsible position which she ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to occupy in the future; namely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of wife to the man whom she loved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolly went about this education in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">novel sort of way, but there was novelty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in everything that she did. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of her theory that a woman must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be "different" to hold a man's love. Sh£</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not realize that to the man who loves</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, every woman is different.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When discussing the subject, Dolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">would say wisely to her chum, Claire</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dale, "Most important of all is a wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">an's physical attractiveness.

He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been born in the town where Dolly lived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but had spent the greater part of his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from home. His father, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">owned the largest bank in town and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of the leading citizens, began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fail in health and sent for Jim to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">home and prepare to step into his place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the future. So Jim came home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolly was just past twenty when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned.

At least so thought Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barclay. He had never seen a girl who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so subtly feminine. Every move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment she made suggested round, soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">curves: and once, when she paused near</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for a moment, his pulse quickened</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he noted the satiny texture of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck and shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the dance was half over. Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">had some one introduce him to her. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found her even more fascinating to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk to than to look at. She had a wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed, candid way of gazing at a fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was disconcerting, and she was dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent from most girls. She had none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those silly advanced ideas that so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many women'have these days. Jim was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad of that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't quite get this suffrage stuff,'*</seg><seg type="columnLine">he confided to her. "I think a woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere is in the home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were sitting out a dance on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balcony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolly nodded acquiescence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"A home and a man's love.

Watching her. Jim Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay told himself that there was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her than to any girl he had met here-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tofore. They had four dances together</seg><seg type="columnLine">that evening, and three of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent in conversation on the balcony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The seed of desire having been im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted in his mind, he proceeded to fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">in love with her by degrees. Thrown to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether a great deal within the narrow'</seg><seg type="columnLine">social limits of a small town, they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know each other as thoroughly as is</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for two people who do not ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually live together. Within a month,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Barclay had fully decided to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to marry him; within a far shorter</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of time. Dolly had decided to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept him when he did ask her. Woman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like. she knew his mind long before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Guided by an unfailing feminine in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct. she hesitated long before accept-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Not that'she had the slightest in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention of refusing. She wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry. She had reached the marriage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able age, and she felt that she w'ould like</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one to lavish upon her all the love</seg><seg type="columnLine">and adoration of a strong, passionate na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. That she must pay the price for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, as we pay for all that we get in life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not enter her mind. She only knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she wanted affection and a home of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own. Jim Barclay offered all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. ' He was fairly good looking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clever enough, and he had more to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in a material way than most young</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. so when she was quite sure that he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cared for her, she allowed herself to fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">in love with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following December they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">married. After a brief honeymoon they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back and settled down in a charm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bungalow on the outskirts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. Not long after Tim's father died,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Jim stepped into his position at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the first year passed by. as it al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways does, with astonishing revelations'</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unsuspected twists and turns in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters of both, and if their respec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive views on matrimony shifted about</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less, they continued to be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much in love as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Certainly Jim was not disappointed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolly. She was as attractive physically</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she had ever been. It was a sacred</seg><seg type="columnLine">rite with her to care religiously for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, and keep herself beautiful always.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xor did she neglect her mind. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was worn out with a trying day at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, she was ever ready with diverting</seg><seg type="columnLine">chatter and charming little attentions.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diligently reading up on various topics</seg><seg type="columnLine">she never failed to discuss intelligently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the affairs of the moment.

They had been so happy, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">content, and now, just when they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiest, this thing had to come! Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, the possibility had never occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her; to other women, yes; but to her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolly?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it's terrible!'' she whispered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself. "Jim and I were so happy to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, we didn't need any one else! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't like children any more than I do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's often said they were a nuisance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What shall I do, oh, what shall I do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the next few days, the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">that threatened her happiness was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, that in spite of her efforts to seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">her usual, carefree self, she could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent jW's noticing that something</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to question her. "Are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">in debt? Has the cook given warning?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or are you worrying about your winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes? Out with it, sweetheart," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, assuming a bantering tone in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to disguise his real anxiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolly jumped at the excuse he sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested. "It's clothes. Really, Jim, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't find anything fit to wear in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. I think I'd like to go to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York and shop this fall. May I?" If</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could only get away until she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to a decision, she might still find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way out of her difficulty, but she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not think clearly while she was in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant danger of Jim's clear eyes discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering what really ailed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely. Wait until next week, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll go with you. A change will do us</seg><seg type="columnLine">both good," he said cheerfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that did not appeal to Dolly. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to go alone. "You don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a serious shopping trip this is go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to be, Jim. I'll be so tired out at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night that I won't feel like going about</seg><seg type="columnLine">\vith you to the theatres and restaurants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We can go later for a good time. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay with Madge, she's been asking me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to visit her for years, and she's lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough in New York to be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take me to all the best shops. Please,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me go alone this time, Jimsey."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madge, an old school friend, would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one to go to for advice, if the hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible possibility that threatened her were</seg><seg type="columnLine">really true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim good-naturedly gave in. "Have it</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own way. When do you want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To-morrow." As long as she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going, there was no sense in delaying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seems you're mighty anxious to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from me. Sure you're not getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired of your old husband?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Jim!" Dolly's arms about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck was the answer to that. Tired of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, when it was the dread of losing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">love that made her fear maternity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped into the hall for his over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat, then came back to kiss her before</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving for the bank. She lifted her</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling face to his. Every trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry had vanished from her features,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her eyes had regained their custom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary sparkle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-by, kiddie," patting her affec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionately on one shoulder. He was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved to have gotten to the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble so easily. "Pack your bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">and be ready to leave on the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">train. I'll bring plenty of cash home</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me this evening."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he slammed the door and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">briskly down the steps, he laughed aloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aren't women the limit? Imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">her worrying her entire system into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of nervous collapse over a winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardrobe I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he laughed again, because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea amused him immensely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolly stayed almost a week in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WRONG WAY	41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> York. She came home tired but content,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> with a trunk filled with her purchases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In a comparatively short time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">household was running as smoothly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. Dolly's laughter filled the rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their customary cheerfulness, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">childishly piquant face was wreathed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant smiles. Sometimes at night, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore dropping off to sleep, she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">j breathe a fervent thanks that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">! escaped an experience which might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">' wrecked her whole life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Now and then nature creates a woman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in whom the maternal instinct is wholly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lacking. It may lie that Dolly was just</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such a woman: or it may be that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instinct was buried so deeply in her soul</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the light had never found it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">During the next three or four years</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolly made several trips to New York,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Jim never raised any objection, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">i cause it seemed to do her good to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">f away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   So the years slipped by, one by one,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with an unbelievable swiftness. After</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a while they went about more in society,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I spending less time together at home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Slowly, but none the less surely, their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">relations toward each other were under-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">going a subtle change. Jim found that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it had become rather tiresome to sit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about evenings. It made him sleepy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and disagreeable. Of late it seemed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9 him that there was something strangely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quiet and unalive about their artistic lit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tle home. But if Dolly had come to feel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the difference she gave no indication of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it. except that a restlessness had taken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the place of her former calm. By such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slow degrees had the atmosphere of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their home life changed, tliat she had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unconsciously drifted with it into a state</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of mind that was less healthy, less</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">normal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Thus, after five or six years of matri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mony, there crept gradually into Jim's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> thoughts the realization that something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was lacking in his life. Just at first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the feeling was uncertain and vague,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> then it began to assume a more definite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> form. When the bank closed in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> afternoons he no longer hurried home</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a9 be had done in the early years of their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> married life. Sometimes he went to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> club, where he lounged around, drinking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moderately, or perhaps got into a friend-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ly game of cards. Sometimes he played</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">golf. But he never went home until the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dinner hour drew near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When she finally realized the change</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that was coming over him, Dolly was at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a loss to understand it. Wherein had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she failed? A sickening dread that per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">haps she was not going to be a success</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as a wife, after all, made her weak with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the thought of the utter void that the loss</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of his love would make in her life. Be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cause she was completely wrapped up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in loving him, in holding his affection,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the roots of her being had twined them-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">selves so strongly about his existence,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that to tear them away now would mean</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that she must droop and wither like a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plant deprived of sun and water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Feverishly she searched her brain for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an explanation and remedy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I've never gone to breakfast in curl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">papers or a wrapper." she moaned help-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lessly. "He can't find any fault with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way our house is run, but he doesn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come home early like he used to and he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seems to be thinking all the time he's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here of an excuse to get away. I might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have known such happiness couldn't last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Men are all alike."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Because she was dazed and worried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to such an extent that she lacked the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">power to reason clearly, Dolly made a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fatal mistake; she began to nag. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there is one thing in all the world that a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man tries to avoid, it is a nagging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman. Where he had previously</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stayed away from home for no apparent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reason, Jim began now to stay away</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">because it got on his nerves to have her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">continually reproaching him for his neg-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''Couldn't you get here a little earlier,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">•Jim? Dinner has been ready half an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hour. You never used to be late." A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sigh. "Where do you spend all your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time? Surely the bank doesn't keep you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so long. Where have you been?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Club."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh, the club. You seem to be aw-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fully fond of the club lately."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Jim finished his soup and began to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glance over the evening paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dolly toyed nervously with a spoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Are you going out to-night?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">42	BREEZY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Um-humph ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Biting her lip in vexation, she tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a rather good show in town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd like to see it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lifted preoccupied eyes to her hurt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, nothing! You never pay any at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention to what I say, anyhow. Why do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you read the paper at the table, Jim?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely you can find time for it during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day. I never see you now except at</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner, and the least you can do is to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be agreeable/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Groaning inwardly, Jim put down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper and tried to begin some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation. But Dolly's mind was oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied with other matters, so she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to converse with any great show</seg><seg type="columnLine">of intelligence. Instead, she watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a haunted, suspicious expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion in her eyes while he talked. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothered Jim to be watched that way, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a muttered excuse, he left the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as the meal was over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their life went on like this indefinitely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had Dolly been another sort of woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by adjusting her views in accordance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the situation, the break in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">daily life might have been mended, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">things would have gone on as smoothly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as before, though on a different basis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is impossible to drift easily through</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence on an equal mental plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since ever-changing circumstances alter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mental and moral ideas of our asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciates, we too must adjust our views</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time to time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some women, seeing their dream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">romance crumbling to the ground, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">know'ing how futile it is to try to rebuild</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, carefully lay away the remains in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most sacred recesses of their hearts, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">relinquish it, w'ith a secret sigh of sor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, forever. Adjusting themselves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">life as it is, they centre their interests</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon something else. Sometimes they</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose their individuality completely in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing and raising of children; and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are content. Sometimes they become ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in women's clubs or in charities;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again they are content. But some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, as with Dolly, they refuse to relin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quish their hold upon the golden thread</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of romance, and the thread cuts ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper into their souls as the years pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">by; and they never find peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One evening Jim went home to din-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner with John Carter, the cashier of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. Of about Jim's age, he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">married a year or so before Jim and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolly. His wife, a plain, comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">little person, who was seemingly oblivi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous to the flesh she was putting on of</seg><seg type="columnLine">late, bustled about, her face flushed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moist, a straight wisp of hair straying</seg><seg type="columnLine">unheeded across her forehead, as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped the one maid lo put the dinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the table. A boy of five clung to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirts, impeding her progress at every</seg><seg type="columnLine">step. Finally she stopped in despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Johnny," she said reprovingly, "why</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't you stay in your place when I put</seg><seg type="columnLine">you there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She lifted him in her arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumped him down in his chair. His fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eye, johnny looked to be on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge of tears, so she patted his close-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cropped head lovingly and gave him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cake from the sideboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's so bashful," she explained as,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much out of breath, she sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the table. "He never lets go of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirt when we have company."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's a fine-looking little fellow," Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She flushed, and her eyes sparkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pleasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think so? But wait till you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the baby. She's only two years old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know. She's asleep now, but she'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be awake soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great kid," the baby's father assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "Both of them are. I made Helen</seg><seg type="columnLine">have Johnny's hair cut last week, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it nearly broke her heart to part with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curls. But one girl in a family's</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough; eh, son?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking up shyly, Johnny grinned at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father with perfect understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim wondered why he had always con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered children a nuisance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When dinner was half over, lusty cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued from above, proclaiming the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby to be very much awake. Her moth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er excused herself and hurried from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, returning almost immediately with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baby, who crowed with delight while</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WRONG WAY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> being settled in her high chair, and be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> gan vigorously to hammer the polished</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> wood with a spoon, grasped tightly in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> her chubby hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Dinner over, they went into the sit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ting room. Carter and Jim smoked and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> talked business. Mrs. Carter sat under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the light and mended, with Johnny and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the baby playing on the floor at her feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Presently the baby went to sleep, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was taken up to bed. Johnny followed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and Mrs. Carter resumed her mending.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It was with a decided shock of sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> prise that Jim awoke to the fact that it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was past eleven. The evening had gone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> by more swiftly for him than any even-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ing had for a long time past. He could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> not help remarking it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "By Jove, it seems only an hour since</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> dinner. 1*11 have to be gwing, Carter,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> but it's so cozy here I hate to leave."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Mrs. Carter smiled pleasantly when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he left, urging him to come again. Car-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ter repeated his wife's invitation, adding,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bring Mrs. Barclay with you next</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Jim thanked him and said that he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> would, but he could not quite imagine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolly at ease in such a homely atmos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> phere. It did not suit her at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Then, suddenly, it came to him what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was lacking in their life. It was chil-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	dren!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "It's queer, I never thought of that,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> said he to himself on the way home.

We decided over six years ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we wouldn't be bothered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know, but I thought--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't like children. You've told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me time and again that you can't bear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course I have told you that. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">always thought them a nuisance, but--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolly shrugged her shoulders, replying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly, -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then why bring up a subject that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thoroughly discussed so long ago?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's rather unusual, isn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," Jim told her gently, ''that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we were just married. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">women have children, and they bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">them so much pleasure, I thought, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps--you wouldn't be so lonely--so--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he floundered, completely at a loss to</seg><seg type="columnLine">express himself, dazed at the look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt which she gave him. A glint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hardness crept slowly into Dolly's"</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, as a light of understanding dawned</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her. She smiled, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterness as well as grim determination</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her smile. So that was it? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to see her occupied that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have more time to himself, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to tie her down with children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry about me being lonely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So long as you are enjoying yourself, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldn't think you need care what be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes of me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cutting sarcasm stung him to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tort. but he refused to give way to anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dolly!" he pleaded. "Listen! 'Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me explain. We seem to be all mixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cutting him short with a gesture, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">disdainfully advised:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't try' to explain. Explanations</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a useless waste of breath."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She walked out of the room and closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course it was futile to say any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more about it. Realizing this, Jim did</seg><seg type="columnLine">his best to forget the incident, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">banished it from his mind. Not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolly. At last she had something defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nite to brood over. The more she</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of it, the firmer became her</seg><seg type="columnLine">BREEZY STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">U</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">conviction that he wanted her to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">children so that her time would be fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied. As the germ of jealousy ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panded in her heart, she began to enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain all sorts of groundless suspicions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps there was another woman ? She</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt sure there was another woman!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who could it be? There is nobody'</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know of, but that is no proof. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course there is some one else, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants to keep me quiet and thinks that</seg><seg type="columnLine">maternity is the surest way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A nagging woman is bad enough. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealous woman is worse. The two com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bined are impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spring came and Jim fell into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit of driving* to the country club</seg><seg type="columnLine">every afternoon for golf. Often he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained for dinner. Sometimes he sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car back for Dolly., and they dined at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the club in company with other married</seg><seg type="columnLine">couples, but he enjoyed himself more</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she was absent. Dolly and Claire</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dale had become inseparable again as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been before Dolly's marriage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he did not feel that he was leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">her alone to any great extent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at this time that Beth Norris</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into Jim's life. She was past</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five, unmarried, brimming over</seg><seg type="columnLine">with energy and the pure joy of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive. Behind her back, the women said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slurring things about her; to her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were charming. Beth's social posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was unquestioned, but in a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">town a girl of her age cannot do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things Beth did, and escape unscathed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She went on her way unheeding, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had been traveling abroad for</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, and had just come home to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">the summer months. Finding time heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her hands, and being athletic, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up golf as a possible form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement. Often she met Jim Barclay</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the links, and they got to be very</seg><seg type="columnLine">well acquainted. There was no coquetry</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Beth's manner toward him. Hers</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a friendly attitude, pure and simple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same as was his own. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found one another agreeable at a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">when each was in need of diversion, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">they formed an innocent friendship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes in the late afternoon, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">several strenuous hours on the links, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">drove her home from the club. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have been more natural? When</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither went back to town for the even-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, they frequently had dinner together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many pleasant days passed in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One afternoon, when Dolly was loung-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in her bedroom reading a novel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Claire came up unannounced. She kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her friend with unusual warmth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps just a shade too much sympathy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How pretty you are looking, dear,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Claire. As indeed Dolly was. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a trifle thinner than of yore, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes had lost their youthful brilliance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was even a tired droop to the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ners of her mouth; but her bronze hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was arranged with becoming care, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pink silk negligee was just the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">foil for he1* sort of beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks, Claire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolly laid aside her book languidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something on her mind. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been worried the last few days be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause the doctor had told her that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">system had run dowm, and that she must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be careful of her physical condition or</seg><seg type="columnLine">she might easily go into a decline; per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps--she shivered every time she</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of it--perhaps consumption.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Claire threw off her hat and sat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You haven't been going out enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear, you look pale."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolly said she was tired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Claire looked sympathetic. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexplicably sad to her that a sweet, lov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able woman like Dolly must waste away</seg><seg type="columnLine">her life caring for a man who was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy to touch the hem of her skirt; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who spent all of his time chasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">after another woman. Every one in</seg><seg type="columnLine">town knew of Jim's infatuation for Beth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norris. That is, every one except Dolly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was with regret that Claire realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherein her duty lay, but as Dolly's best</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doll," said she, abruptly. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to tell you this, but I think you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">thank me for it in the end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolly's brows contracted. Pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously at the lace on her negligee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she leaned forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" she demanded sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, nothing much," evaded Claire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WRONG WAY	45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She wished suddenly that she had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken. Dolly was calm but insistent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is something, Claire. I've no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed it in your manner for several days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">] think you'd better tell me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Claire told her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time Dolly lay back in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair with her eves cfosed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally she spoke. "Thank you for</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling me. Claire. I know you meant it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the best. And now, we'll say no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more about it. Will you have tea ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Claire breathed a sigh of relief that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolly had taken the news so calmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," she said, and then she* began</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly to talk of impersonal matters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But after her guest had gone, Dolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped her head on her arms and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender body shook with uncontrollable</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobs. It was true! What she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreading had come. There was another</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. She knew now why Jim had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed different of late. He was try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to keep her from any suspicion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth, and she had thought that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">still cared some, after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day, she was caught in a severe</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain storm, and before she could get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxi, she was drenched to the skin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feet were soaking wet. As soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she reached the house, she took off her</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet things, but it was too late to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent the cold from settling on her lungs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in consequence, she was ill for* sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral weeks. When she was finally able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go about again, she suffered from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly lassitude, and no amount of doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toring seemed to do her any permanent</seg><seg type="columnLine">good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inertia so dulled her senses that, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though she realized the state of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">health, she was unable to interest her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in taking the necessary measures to</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome the danger that threatened her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She felt nothing but the bitterest hatred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jealousy; her horizon had narrowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it contained only Beth Norris and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim. There was not even room for her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self m her thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Barclay had given up seeing Beth</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he realized the true state of affairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He devoted more time to Dolly than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had for over a year, trying to be as pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tient and gentle with her as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The doctor had told him frankly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was going into consumption, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that only immediate attention would save</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. When fall came, with its raw, cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting winds and rainy, unpleasant days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he argued and begged and pleaded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to go to a sanitarium until the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter months were over. But Dolly was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubbornly obdurate. There was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the matter with her. She had a cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was all. It was ridiculous to insist</seg><seg type="columnLine">uj&gt;on shutting her up in a sanitarium for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slight cold on her chest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day when she could stand it no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer she completely lost control of</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you suppose I don't know why</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want to put me in a sanitarium?''</seg><seg type="columnLine">She laughed hysterically. "You must</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe I haven't any eyes. Do you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't know about Beth Norris? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you're in love with her. I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've been seeing her in public all sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer, and I haven't the slightest doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what you still see her on the sly. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if-you imagine I'm going to waste away</seg><seg type="columnLine">my time in a sanitarium so that you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a better chance to carry on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgusting flirtation, you give me credit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for being more of a fool than I am!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim glared angrily. "That's a damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie 1" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His indignation was getting the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his good judgment.

For months the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm had been threatening, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deluge actually came it left in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake irreparable damage. It was ?m-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for their life ever to be the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The weeks that followed were an end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less torture to both. Slowly but surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">his love for her had been dying, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">there remained only pity; and when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">love like that which he had felt for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns to pity it is terrible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolly realized this, and her heart was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like lead in her breast. She knew now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had taken the wrong way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had brought her misery upon her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self : she had tried to circumvent Nature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nature had taken her revenge. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had avoided maternity at a fearful cost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, to add to the bitterness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her reflections, she realized that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeated her own ends: that Jim had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted the children she had refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear: that contrary to her earlier beliefs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">children would have strengthened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bond between husband and wife, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakened it As the mother of his son,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she might have kept Jim's love, as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife only, she had lost it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She began to fail rapidly and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring her condition was such that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer had the strength to resist her</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor's orders, so they took her to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanitarium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a while they hoped that she might</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover temporarily, but as the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed the futility of such a hope was all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">too plainly evident. Perhaps if she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared enough she might have gotten bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter in time, but there was nothing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she wanted to live. Her strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all but gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Realizing this, they brought her home</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the end of the following summer.

According</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my Saturday afternoon habit I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the town of Kirkwood, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tending to strike out from there for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long walk--thinking that I might note</seg><seg type="columnLine">something worth recording among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various clay and rock strata which</seg><seg type="columnLine">abound in the district. Well, the person</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whom I wish to tell you sat back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and coughed. It was a disagreeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">hacking cough, that was ill bred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">annoyed me. At each explosion he sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gust of air upon the back of my neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">--air that was redolent of onions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacco consumed in a pipe.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife and the two children came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel to live with him. and I found her a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty little woman who had once sold</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain necessary articles of men's ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parel in a department store. She said</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had loved McCartnv at once because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was the first man who blushed when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked her to wait on him. Mrs. 1 I' e</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that was her name--was fond of Kirk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood and soon discovered a little house</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a big yard, which she said was an ideal</seg><seg type="columnLine">home.

They were so extremely, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessarily grateful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How McCartny changed! He took off</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight at one place, but it was an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">provement--and his face filled out. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin altered from a glassy pink and white</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a smooth evenly distributed ruddiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">*--then to a weatherbeaten tan. His lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">curled up where they had curled down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the wrinkles and hollows about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes disappeared. "Lefty" Joe came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point where, instead of being merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked off his balance during the box-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, he would crash down and lie still</seg><seg type="columnLine">for several minutes. When he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaken, he would yell with approval and</seg><seg type="columnLine">declare that he was going to "quit his</seg><seg type="columnLine">job." But he never did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As my new friends became more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more happy, something occurred which</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused me considerable mental perturba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, occasioning a most natural depres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of spirits. One day when I was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to the university from Kirkwood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Lillie came in on the car with me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When we reached the junction where one</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes from the country to the city car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we both descended, I to walk to the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versity, she to continue to town. I chatted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her until her car arrived, assisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in boarding it, raised my hat while</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling a cheerful good-by to the brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">little woman--and turned to look square-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly into the sarcastic eyes of Miss Nettie!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, my friendship for Miss Nettie</seg><seg type="columnLine">has endured through several years. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in every way a superior woman. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">management of the girls' dormitory sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports that statement. We have attended</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the university functions together</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at certain times--while calling at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dormitory parlor--our relations have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been extremely cordial. Once or twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the parlor was empty of others, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have summoned my courage and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain leading remarks which, while not</seg><seg type="columnLine">flirtatious, were intended to be construed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as giving evidence of the real affection</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I entertain for her. Once I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fondled her hand for a very short time</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we were chaperoning a dance in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gymnasium. At all such times she has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been fretful, changing from cheerfulness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to petulance and sharp remarks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the junction I at once detected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">something in her manner which caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart to beat unaccountably. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid I stammered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Good evening, Professor Curtis," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled--with such a menacing sweetness</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and pushed past me to board the car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I proceeded to my room much cast down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'for I perceived that she was incensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day was Saturday, and I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bated whether, for the sake of appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances, I had not best remain at the col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lege. However, I learned that Miss Net-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tie had gone to a matinee with Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harris, of the Mathematics chair, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">is an elderly and, if you will pardon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remark, over-educated fool. So I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the car, resolved to visit my cheerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. I had boarded it and was seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a window reading, when I heard some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one walking upon the gravel of the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form outside. It was Miss Nettie and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Harris--of course that parsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monious individual would never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted money upon a matinee perform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance when the day was half warm enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for walking! We all smiled cheerfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waved to one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dating from this incident commenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">a period when I was at a loss to conduct</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself in a way which would please Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nettie. When I called upon her, a maid</seg><seg type="columnLine">would constantly interrupt us to inform</seg><seg type="columnLine">her that Professor Harris wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak to her upon the telephone. I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to a theatre presenting a highly di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verting farce which concerned a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in love with a most jealous woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she told me that she considered such</seg><seg type="columnLine">performances improper and of a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">moral level! I chaperoned a dance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and when I gave way to the impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunities of some of the co-eds and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged in a tango or foxtrot, she declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a cutting distinctness that made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">co-eds giggle, that I never used to be so'</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of a social lion--nor had I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed dancing with her. I promptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested that she become my partner</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the next dance, which appeared but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to increase her resentment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1	consulted my savings book, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if there was a sufficient balance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank I might end this unfortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of affairs by asking her to marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">A VERACIOUS ACCOUNT	57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	me. To my disappointment, I was forced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	to acknowledge that even with the three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hundred dollars returned I had far too</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little money for such a venture. Miss</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II	Nettie continued unreasonable and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">j time came when I was most happy while</seg><seg type="columnLine">! smoking my pipe in McCartny's training</seg><seg type="columnLine">! quarters--or while cycling beside him as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he trotted over the roads. Consequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">' I went more often to Kirkwood after</seg><seg type="columnLine">classes and would not return to the cam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pus until late at night. Miss Nettie--and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">J'ou would never think this of so intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ectual a woman--deliberately threw' her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">I self at Harris. If I spoke to her, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">I replied in a sharp way that made me un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A day or so before the fight, McCartny</seg><seg type="columnLine">j relaxed, and I could not be with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It left me with two evenings on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hands. The first I spent with Miss Net-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tie and it was most uncomfortable. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 had an accusing way of looking at me</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 that was disconcerting. When I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make up for my seeming neglect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and became in my demeanor a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">I more--ah--I will say affectionate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though that is scarcely the proper term,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she became very angry indeed and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me not to make an example of myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the co-eds and their callers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to please sit across the table from her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Harris w'as calling upon her the next</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night so I dropped in at the parlors to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">see Miss Gilfillan. assistant in the histori-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cal department, whom I have ever found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to be entertaining if rather "light." We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">got along famously and as Miss Gilfillan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was popular with the co-eds.

Perhaps some</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BREEZY STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">day when I was buying a pair of--of--</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmentionables, and should blush as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">always do, some faithful, friendly girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">might--but at any rate, I was fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful. I discovered an old English</seg><seg type="columnLine">book on prizefighting and in it saw what</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes were necessary for such a func-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Full evening dress was shown in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the pictures--not even dinner coats--</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxing evidently being a gala event in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sporting circles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I donned my evening clothes, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">my silk hat and set out. The night air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bracing, the stars were sparkling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clear-cut evening in early autumn, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt more good-natured than in a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">while. I even hummed snatches of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blue Danube waltz as I made my way</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the faculty dormitory along the cin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der path which led past the gymnasium</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on to the car line. I received a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock when some one near the gymna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sium cried heartily:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So cheerful, Curtis!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For it was Harris, of course, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Nettie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bustle at the Coliseum revived my</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits. I went to McCartny's dressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and found him nervous and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed. His wife was with him, patting</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on the back and laughing in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears in her eyes. He was cross and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to stop that baby-acting and to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside where she belonged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did he weigh r he asked Joe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a husky tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe's answer displeased him for he im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately cried out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Five pounds more than me!

"Gettin' scared already?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe kept silent after that and his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">curled up again. He saw me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What're you all dressed up like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pall-bearer for ?" he said nastily. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't going to be no funeral."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I came to wish you well," I returned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceding much to his nervousness. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his hand and proceeded to the seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had reserved for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My clothes 1 found were out of place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T possessed none that would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in keeping, for 1 would die rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">own to such green vests, diamond studs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming neckties. And I would die under</seg><seg type="columnLine">torture rather than go about as some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spectators did without a collar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with uncleanly linen. I quickly decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I would keep my coat on and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">eschew the new white kid gloves I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">procured for the occasion. My hat cre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated considerable excitement. One per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, a youth of about sixteen, stole it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from under my seat and horrified me by</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking an official to take it out and fill</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with a dime's worth of beer! Luckily</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man refused to do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Added to my discomfort was a feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of concern for my friend McCartny. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me men were saying that McCart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ny couldn't return to championship--no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one ever did--and they speculated freely</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to whether he would be beaten in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third round or the fifth. One man risked</seg><seg type="columnLine">money that the contest would not last</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten rounds. Another, who smelled of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky, and who loudly informed us that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he represented McGinnis Three Star</seg><seg type="columnLine">Distillery, offered to bet me twenty to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon "Memphis" O'Neill, who was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight McCartny. I gathered that twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one meant that if McCartny should ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complish his purpose I would be paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty dollars for every one which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">risked. I had twenty dollars with me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, catching the exciting atmosphere, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagered it. I was soon sorry that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done so. for I gathered from others, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Memphis" had longer arms, greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight and was younger than McCartny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man stepped into the square plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form where the contest was to take place</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made a short speech. He told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience that the champion of Hoboken</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to encounter the New Orleans</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baby in a select three-round contest. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be joking for he winked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">us quite often and the audience received</seg><seg type="columnLine">his words with a roar of laughter. Fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing this a negro and a white boy got</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ring and proceeded to batter each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Thp men about me howled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter all the time and told the white !</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to kick the other in the shins. As !</seg><seg type="columnLine">this would have been unfair under the '</seg><seg type="columnLine">rules the white man, sportsman-like, re- •</seg><seg type="columnLine">A VERACIOUS ACCOUNT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5 framed from doing so. He won the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow, according to a sort of umpire or</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 judge who danced about the ring with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There were two more such encounters</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a pause. Then a big uproar began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">, I saw a powerful stranger climbing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 the ring. It was "Memphis." My heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">, sank as I realized that here was the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponent of the nervous and irritable man</seg><seg type="columnLine">L I had just seen in the dressing room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Never was a more confident, square-</seg><seg type="columnLine">( jawed rough-looking engine of brute</seg><seg type="columnLine">; force. I asked the man of the whisky</seg><seg type="columnLine">' breath if he would not retract the bet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereat every one about me laughed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man refused to do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Some one brushed past me--for I sat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the aisle--and I saw McCartny. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he was not dispirited as in the dressing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">room--he was smiling. And when he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. had gained the floor amid a few faint</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cheers I saw that he did not compare</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unfavorably with ''Memphis." He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glanced my way and I noted that his eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were snapping--and his lips wrcre so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lightly poised in their smile as to make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his jawrs fully as square as those of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In a moment or so they were fighting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I had become quite sick at times during</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the other contests, but now' I felt thrilled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This was to be the compensation, perhaps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for my own lost happiness; and as for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fMcCartny, his whole future hung upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it. And it was not so brutal as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">others. There was more technique, more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">finish to this performance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  McCartny was shifty and steady. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other man seemed more deft and speedy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in his wav of boxmg. "Memphis" got</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a round of applause after a fast passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I saw McCartny's head flip back once</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but could not tell how it was done. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caused another outbreak. The man of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the whisky breath began to pound my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The evening passed rapidly. I w-as</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy watching each period of fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">but during the periods of rest I felt it</seg><seg type="columnLine">i necessary to defend my friend in the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">( grv arguments which beat about me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Memphis" seemed from the first to have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■	an advantage for he hurried about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I struck viciously time after time. Mc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cartny stood steadfast weathering each</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm of blows and only replying occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionally. I noticed that when he did so</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm moved quickly as a snake's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue--and his fist struck with a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounding impact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After three periods, McCartny was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite battered. His body had red spots</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it, his chin, jaw and forehead wrere</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly contused to judge from the flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance. Blood ran from his nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mouth and he came to look like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn old cat which I once possessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of it he kept on and for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see was just as steady as ever in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his maneuvering. His opponent was lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle hurt. Only a few7 marks upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body show'ed where McCartny's blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone home. "Memphis'" face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">untouched, pink and leering always. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was refreshed quite frequently from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the fifth period of fighting McCart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ny dropped quickly to the floor. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose slowly and I sawr it was an effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to do so. But he got on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and w^ent on fighting steadily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's a beggar for punishment, old</seg><seg type="columnLine">TCayo,' " shouted the man with whom I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wagered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that so ?" I asked. "Well he is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beggar--he's only a little embarrassed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tf you really think he will be pun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, I will say that this affair is en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely within the law."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whisky man swore!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the next period, McCartny was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed over against the ropes and seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazed and unable to save himself from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury of punches "Memphis'' was deliver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Knock him out, 'Memphis!'" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky man roared.

Mouth open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ - ---- ------</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">60</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BREEZY STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I watched them, wondering what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused this sudden change in affairs.

"Memphis"</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuvered coyly to avoid it, but while</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head was jerked out of the way, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist struck upon his neck and--actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore open the skin. The blood spurted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and I cheered wildly, believing our</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of victory had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did come too in the next period,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when after a furious passage, "Memphis"</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled back from McCartny, stood limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment and then slowly collapsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rloor. I learned this was the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult of those stomach blows of McCart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ny's. "Memphis" arose, painfully, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was immediately knocked down again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this time stayed down. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief period the referee, umpire or judge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took McCartny's right hand and held it</seg><seg type="columnLine">above his head and the crowd cheered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They told me I had seen history in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">making, which was an error, due I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose to unfamiliarity with standard</seg><seg type="columnLine">reference works, for certainly none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them give attention to this sport.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was sitting smiling happily when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheering had died.

"And by the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">your chance comes, you've lost what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods gave you. and all that's left is to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on grinding out copy to the end of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">days." She looked into the girl's eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unwonted gleam in her own. "If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe in prayer, pray that she'll see you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that she'll talk.

Its shuttered win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows were forbidding. It looked unoc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied. Alicia recognized the possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the newspapers were wrong, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Mrs. Pickering was away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned sick with foreboding.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dejection which had been growing on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">for weeks, the almost certainty that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken the wrong turning were dissi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pated as by a miracle.

Two months of pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionate grieving had left their trace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More significant than all else, her hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed brown at the roots.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaint shelf contained an array of rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">ivories and cloisonne, above which hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">a water-color of apple blossoms against</seg><seg type="columnLine">an insipid, blue sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Benton later came to laugh at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.

With</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed freedom, Darrow hung his</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat upon the rack and proceeded to fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low her into the kitchen. "Kind of hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">py to-night, aren't you?

Perhaps, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edith's following it would not be a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea to copy her, to swing herself, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of her bank account, into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York popularity that obliterated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past.

No-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ibody thinks of all that yam now. Amy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Collamore is dead.

Give the devil his due!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I do not think Edith forgets," re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> marked Amy thoughtfully. "The ques-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Stion is whether I can make myself of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such value to her friends that no skele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton can frighten them with tales of me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's my personality of to-day against my</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation of yesterday."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The next party that Edith Matterson</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> gave Amy persuaded her husband to at-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tend. He seemed terribly ill at ease</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and clung to Benton for protection. "For</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heaven's sake, Paul, what do you and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amy sec in this crowd ? The police raid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> places far more respectable than this!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That Drake woman hasn't clothes enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> on to make a pen-wiper and the husband</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of that woman with John Morvalle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> doesn't make enough money to buy her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hairpins! Gee, it's a riddle to me!

"Thev are not fit to look</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at Amy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Venner veered suddenly. "She's set</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> on cultivating them, though. Why, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know, but if she wants to, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. I owe a good deal to Amy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You owe her protection more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything," replied Benton angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether the remark went home or</seg><seg type="columnLine">not Benton never knew. Venner had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exasperating way of believing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could do no wrong after having done</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magnificent thing of bestowing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name upon a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In disgust at him. Benton turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went in search of Amy. She was, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual, surrounded. John Morvalle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his female satellites were arranging for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a theater party, a luncheon and a tea</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following week. As he passed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">he overheard their plans for the coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">summer in a place, they joyfully agreed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where no one would know them and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not need to care what they did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were looking, then, for a land</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unrestrained liberty, and had strange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly picked a little town in an old blue law</seg><seg type="columnLine">state for their stamping ground. Ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton wondered as he watched them just</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much more liberty it would be pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible for them to take than that in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reveled now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tiresome evening for Venner was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last over. His mind had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the guests, but down in Mexico,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, as he termed it, "a man had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All during the ride home Venner ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiated over the freedom of living in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open, where, he quoted bromidically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There ain't no ten commandments." It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to Amy every one was longing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for jUst such a spot on earth. She won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if it were a sign that the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">was growing worse because of this desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">or better because the demands of decency</seg><seg type="columnLine">were growing more restraining.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fact that Venner too was cramped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the land of restraint was proven</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, early in February, he started for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexico in company with Darrow. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">his request Benton came with Amy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pier, but he could not fail to notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Venner's anxiety about Amy's social</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moral welfare was far exceeded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his anxiety over the tardiness of sailing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the gang plank was pulled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was waving good-by to his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and friend. Long before Amy thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BREEZY STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of leaving the pier, Venner and Darrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">had moved out of sight to the other side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is going to be different now," be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan Benton as they retraced their steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the street. "I cannot run up as I used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to unless you keep a maid or companion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why you have persisted in doing your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own work I do not know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To keep my mind occupied, I guess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do not like to think too much/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You ought to have an older woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you." suggested Benton. "I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one. She would not only take the care</seg><seg type="columnLine">off your hands, which will not be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much with Venner away, but she will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">company for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will be lonely, won't I, but then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Drake and Mrs. Holden have</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised to run in often."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Benton ignored that. "Let me send</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman up, will you--a Mrs. Gerry?</seg><seg type="columnLine">She will be like a mother to you--some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to go back to after you have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with your firefly friends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, send her up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it was decided, and the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening Mrs. Gerry appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was a motherly soul, who never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be idle but rather always look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for some new service to perform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One evening, at the close of Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry's first week, she came hurrying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Amy's room. "A lady with a lovely</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice is calling you on the telephone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've been wondering why some of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl friends haven't been coming around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing as they do, that you are alone."</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the telephone Mrs. Holden's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">came cooing over the wire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that you, Amy dear? Well, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Blanche Holden. John Morvalle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to come up and see you for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while. We knew you would be lonely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we are just tired to death of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at by people who do not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand us. May we come?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was sincere comradeship with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one whom society dare not scorn. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one who not only appreciated her</seg><seg type="columnLine">loneliness, but trusted her with her se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crets. Of course they must come! Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not this the beginning of her achieve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, this trust of Blanche Holden?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would she not in case of any stalking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">skeleton in her own life be in her debt</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this secret meeting and expect her</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not more than a half hour after</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arrival, however, that Amy found</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself being eliminated from the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation and later her very presence be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming ignored. In a semi-conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">way she realized that her training must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been narrow, that a clandestine love</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene such as was being enacted in word</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tone before her eyes, was the privi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lege of the accepted in society.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the trio were startled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringing of the telephone. Amy laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">down her book to answer the call. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint feeling stole over her as she took</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the receiver. A fear that some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">might call who would not, could not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">approve, made the whole situation appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly and unhealthy. The voice came</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear over the wire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Mr. Holden speaking. Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blanche there?" Amy's hand quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the transmitter. "It is your hus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">band, Blanche, what shall I say ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell him I'm not here, goosie, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you expect me later. Then, if lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">chooses to call, why, Johnnie will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amy removed her hand and weighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lie for the fraction of a second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mrs. Holden has not arrived yet. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised to come up some time, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am expecting her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is all right then," came the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply. "She was not home for dinner nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Mattersons. I just wondered if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could be with you. Good-night."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nervously Amy clicked the receiver</seg><seg type="columnLine">back upon the hook. As she turned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morvalle's arms were around Blanche</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think Mr. Holden wanted to be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you were safe," said Amy coldly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He trusts you--he loves you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor Tom!" sighed Blanche Holden</seg><seg type="columnLine">flippantly. "I suppose he does. That is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pity, he loves and never under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There seemed to be a shade of excuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">if not propriety in the remark, and Amy</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted to store it away upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelves of her limited experience. Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">after her guests had left she sat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">HER HOME TOWN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. pondered over the difference between</seg><seg type="columnLine">f real and imaginary sin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the week that followed, Benton</seg><seg type="columnLine">J came but once and that time for dinner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">J Amy was strangely quiet. At length</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	she "mentioned having read something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect that one had better be forever</seg><seg type="columnLine">j on the outside of public approval than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to climb up to it by a muddy path, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Benton what he thought of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What do you mean?" he asked. "Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">j you beginning to be disgusted with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">( new friends:"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh, no, not at all.

"Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know they asked to come, but you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">never return the call with me.

Leaning back against the cush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions of the couch in Edith's drawing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, she asked: "Do Ada Drake or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blanche Holden ever take their men</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends alone to the home of any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">else ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gracious, no; they would not dare!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edith sat bolt upright.

You haven't honored</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twilight for some time. Down on busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness?" She glanced the young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, noting the neat suit, the white col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar. and the purple bee-flower in his but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonhole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe blushed prodigiously and kept an</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasy silence.

"Courtin', Joe?" he cackled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let him alone. Pa," said his daughter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the old man had found a congenial</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject and could not drop it at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Takes a lot o' nerve, Joe," he went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"a powerful lot o' nerve; but you'll land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.

But here Mrs. Ash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by interfered and, followed by Joe, led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way to the little parlor back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">store.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down.

"Mears Junction'll be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">town before you knowr it. There's three</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses there now. Got a new house -my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got a new house, have you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, she's a dandy.

"I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Ashby laughed a big, warm laugh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" 'Fess up, Joe," she said, "is it my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Joe, and wondered why</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't feel happier. Mrs. Ashby, not-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the lack of enthusiasm in his voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed at him keenly. "Don't make a mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take. Joe," she warned him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no: I--I won't," said Joe, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">really thought he meant it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Ashby called Bess from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen, and the girl came in flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her work about the stove, a youth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful image of her mother, rosy and alert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Ashby stepped out into the store.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the pause that followed the first greet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, while Bess rolled down the sleeves</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her sturdy young arms, and Toe</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared his throat huskily, they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear her mother speaking to the old man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently his voice floated in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'll land her! He'll land her!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said shrilly, with a knowing laugh. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed the very fust gal I axed. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes nerve!" Then the door slammed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bess's clear eyes softened and the rosy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">color deepened in her cheeks as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the young man who stood be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore her. During the half yea? he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been at Mears Junction, she had met him</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequently enough to compare his abun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dant energy favorably with the more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less slouching attitude of the Twilight</seg><seg type="columnLine">youths; and to more than admire hi**</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight figure, sturdy strength, and hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est eyes. Now she yearned for his love,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet she knew that it was not hers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joe," she said, "dou't beat about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush. You don't really want me, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">just want a housekeeper. Isn't that so?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She paled a little as she spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bess," said Joe, "you've hit it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">honestly, there's not another girl in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world I like half as well as you. and I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be an awfully proud man if you'd marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bess nodded, smiled, and shook a tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her eye. Joe took her hands in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kissed her gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can love enough for two--for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while," said Bess, "but you'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a turn at it. Joe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will, I will!" he exclaimed. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then they sat down to talk over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnishing of the new house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, however, he took his depar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, for he had to be back at the Junc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for the down train, and relieve his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion there, a green hand at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telegraph instrument. Leaving the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, he climbed the hill that led away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the valley to the heights beyond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sun was nearing its setting, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, green valley, cut lengthwise by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow waters of tl^e Arkansas, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooded by the level rays. Joe turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back upon the splendor, and his face to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sombre hills, pine-clad, silent, terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their remote serenity. His horse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoofs clattered over a little bridge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowed down to steady climbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Joe, and sighed, "that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And just then, at the turning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, where a crimson splash of sumach</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed against the dark hemlocks, Fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervened. Down the road, driving two</seg><seg type="columnLine">cows before her, came a girl, a slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature scarcely on the verge of woman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood. The scant skirt of her faded blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress readied only to the tops of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">AT TWILIGHT	89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dusty little shoes. Her flower-like face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was purely pale in the shadow of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark hair. She carried an armful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">goldenrod; and as Joe approached her</seg><seg type="columnLine">she raised great questioning eyes to his,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a child would. Her cheeks were tear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God in Heaven!" said Joe below his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. He reined in his horse sharply,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the girl, terrified by the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement, dropped her flowers. Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped down quickly, and stooping, gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered up the stalks of goldenrod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry I frightened you," he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan: and then, gazing steadily into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little timid face. "Will you tell me your</seg><seg type="columnLine">name ?*'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name is Cynthia Marsh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you live in Twilight ?

"I was lonely." she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't Mrs. Kelly kind to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another pause. The tinkle of the cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bells came faintly: the horse pawed im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently in the dusty road. The dusk</seg><seg type="columnLine">deepened. A cold wind blew and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows grew' alien, menacing. Joe had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's gaze with his. "I'm Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adams," he said slowly, "and I'd give</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole world if I had met you an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago." Then, before the girl's astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes he mounted his horse and was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is uphill all the way to the Junction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had Joe's thoughts not been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumultuous, he would have found time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for reflection. For so clear-eyed a chap</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rode rather blindly, overwhelmed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had so suddenly and unexpectedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">befallen him. Could he indeed be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had ridden forth so nonchalant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly but a few hours ago in search of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife? The red west over the roofs of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Twilight caught his eye, and he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bess and groaned. The silver moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising above the hills smote his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its pale beauty. "Cynthiaf* he</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured, "Cynthia!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arrived at the station he called roughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Little Bob Cresson to come out</seg><seg type="columnLine">double-quick and get his horse. Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob. a six-foot giant, came out upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform grinning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another turn-down, Joe?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, you fool!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe kicked the mail-bag down over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the steps into unknown depths in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canyon below. "I'd like to kick the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole damned universe!" he growled</seg><seg type="columnLine">savagely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nowhere does the year die so glo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riously as in the uplifted hills, for while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower reaches are aflame with red</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gold, the heavenward peaks are al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready white with snow. But for Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adams the splendor of October passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnoticed. Twice a week, leaving Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob in charge of the Junction, he rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">down between trains to Twilight, osten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly to see Bess Ashby, in reality to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch a glimpse, at least, of Cynthia</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marsh. Sitting in the little parlor, mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing plans for the future with rosy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeked Bess, he was arranging to time</seg><seg type="columnLine">his departure so as to meet Cynthia as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she drove home the cows from pasture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And while he was outwardly loyal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess, planning the new home with her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and purchasing at Salida the pieces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">furniture she expressed a desire for, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart was yearning for the wistful face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wide eyes that flashed so eagerly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his approach. He never had more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few words with Cynthia, and then rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">on up the hill, angry with himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious with all his world besides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> November came at last, red at sunrise</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saffron at sunset, but with the days</seg><seg type="columnLine">between sunless, yet clear, like pearls</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a string.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe had been sorely tried of late. Bess</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made a visit to the Junction and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone over the little house, trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming its awkward arrangements with</seg><seg type="columnLine">deft touches, and putting linens and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankets into place. Why could he not</seg><seg type="columnLine">love Bess, he asked himself, or at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BREEZY STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be satisfied with her love for him? Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he not wanted a housekeeper? Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">she not make a good one, warm-hearted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable, and entirely to be depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon? What more could a fellow want,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway? Ah, Cynthia! Cynthia!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One afternoon, just at dusk, fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the irritation of a visit to poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess, Joe came upon Cynthia on the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge over Twilight Water, beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn of the road. She was wrapped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little red cloak, and she leaned upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railing, watching the swirling moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain stream below her. The air was full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fine white flakes of snow which fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly upon her head and shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her figure drooped disconsolately, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was so wrapped in her thoughts that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did not hear him coming. Joe dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted and approached softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cynthia!" The girl turned. Tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen upon her cheeks. Before she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could brush them away, Joe's arms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dearest girl, what is the matter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was afraid you didn't love me," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Who can stem a mountain torrent?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who can stop the progress of a storm?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not these two; and for a space the steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills might have reeled about them for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all they knew or cared. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cynthia spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have only you in all the world, Joe."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her words broke the spell. Joe's arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to his sides. He wondered if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew. "Cynthia. I can't--" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused abruptly. The girl took his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in both of hers and held it against her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have no father and no mother," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on. "I can't even remember them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have wanted somebody to love all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. Bess has a lover, too, I think; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks so happy. But Pm sure he can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">compare with mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe took her face in his hands. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight had deepened, and he could just</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her glad eyes uplifted to his.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Cynthia, you must meet me here to-mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row at this time. I shall have something</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you.*'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me now," she suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--no, not to-night! To-night is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ours!" Then a last passionate embrace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cynthia wrapped her doak about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went swiftly toward Twilight. Bess</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sp kind; she would tell Bess the</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy news. At the house she found</seg><seg type="columnLine">.Mrs. Ashby sorting mail in the office and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pa reading the morning paper. Cynthia</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out into the kitchen, carefully clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the two intervening doors behind her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess was getting supper. She paused in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her operations w'ith the frying pan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up. Instead of the pale face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listless figure she had been accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see, here before her stood a veritable</seg><seg type="columnLine">young goddess, with glowing cheeks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">great eyes lit by an inner flame. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed in wonderment at the transfigured</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has happened to you, Cynthie?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked kindly. She turned the frying</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat with dexterous wrist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cynthia took hold of the sleeve of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess's gown. "Bess," she said softly, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a lover."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A lover? Some one here in Twi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light? Why, Cynthia, who can it be?" "</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess's mind ran rapidly over the few'</seg><seg type="columnLine">young men in the little town who. by</seg><seg type="columnLine">grace of youth or circumstances, might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be eligible as lovers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have loved him ever since I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been here," wrent on Cynthia, "but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">only knew to-night that he loved me. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives up at the Junction." She held back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name as a last sweet morsel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At the Junction? Oh, it's Bob Cres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. then. A nice boy, Cynthia."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Bess, his name is Joe Adams."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spoon fell from Bess's hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clattered upon the floor. Her warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks paled and her blue eves narrowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She seized Cynthia's shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Has Joe Adams told you that he loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" she demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cynthia's voice came in a frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasp. "Yes," she said, "yes. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldn't he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because he's mine!" said Bess. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have stolen him ! You are a thief! Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hear? A thief!" She shook the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender shoulders fiercely. Her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose shrilly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cynthia moaned. "Oh, Bess!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Oh, Bess !"</seg><seg type="columnLine">AT TWILIGHT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened and Mrs. Ashby, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by Pa, came hurriedly in. Bess</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid no heed. She was panting, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands trembled, but still she shook the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened younger girl. "You knew!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she screamed. "You knew he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then at last Cynthia asserted herself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," she said, "I did not know. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a thief nor a liar. But now that I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, I shall never speak to him again."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wrenching herself free from Bess's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp, she stepped quickly to the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and opened it. A soft swirl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow entered. Cynthia drew herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep your lover. I don't want him."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she went out into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pa rubbed his knotted hands together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Couldn't keep your beau, could ye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess?" he chuckled. "Let the little gal</seg><seg type="columnLine">steal him from ye, didn't ye, Bess? In</seg><seg type="columnLine">my day--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A firm hand was laid across his mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pa," said Mrs. Ashby, "you be quiet!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess, you go upstairs and cool down."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess looked at her mother. The hot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry eyes wavered before the cool and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady ones. The girl turned and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">upstairs. Pa made one more effort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Couldn't keep--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pa, you jes' shut right up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upstairs, Bess, upon her bed, wept</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and bitterly. Below, her mother sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the window looking out into the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the fast-falling snow. Pa fell asleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The kitchen fire died down and went out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slipper w^s forgotten. The little clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the shelf ticked out sixty minutes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then another sixty, and then there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a knock at the office door. Mrs. Ashby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff with cold, opened the door, and Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adams came in. His face was haggard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mrs. Ashby," he said, "I want to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," said Mrs. Ashby, "that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had better see me first." Her eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See you first?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And explain about Cynthia."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe brushed an arm across his eyes as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though to clear away a mist. "Does</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bess know?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I came to ask Bess if she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry me to-morrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Ashby loved her daughter, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she also loved fair play. "Joe," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you made a mistake once, in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my warning. Are you going to make an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other now ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to do my duty," said Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">doggedly. Mistake or no mistake, it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all a fellow can do. Please call Bess."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Ashby sighed. One can be wiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">at fifty than at twenty-five, but one can</seg><seg type="columnLine">never be quite so determined. Followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Joe, she went to the kitchen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">called up the stairway to her daughter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a few minutes Bess came down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes were heavy with weeping, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she held her head high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bess, I want you to marry me to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bess looked at him steadily. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother, watching her, recognized in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">child a kindred spirit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is now or never, Bess," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is never," said Bess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this point Pa, who had been sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing heavily in his chair, roused up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinked sleepily. He gazed at the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">intent figures. Then he blinked know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly. "Throwed ye over, hasn't she,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe? And Cynthy's gone. Guess ye're</seg><seg type="columnLine">left high and dry, Joe, high and dry!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe turned instantly to the old man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where has Cynthia gone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bess there turned her out. You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got yourself in trouble, Joe, courtin' two</seg><seg type="columnLine">gals to oncet." He rose stiffly from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and peered out the window. "Kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' bad night to be out in, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe flashed upon Bess with angry eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How long has she been gone?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since supper time," replied the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">dully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you," turning to Mrs. Ashby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you let that child go out into a night</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this one, and alone, hours ago?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They called the little gal a thief. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard 'em," insisted Pa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a groan Joe hurled himself out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and slammed it behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> LTtter peace reigned without. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow had ceased falling and lay in soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">92</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BREEZY STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">swirls and eddies. The heavens were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, although a cloud-wrack hid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. In the dear spaces of the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung the steady stars. Far away up</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be heard the roar of a train enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a rocky tunnel. Joe galloped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse down the narrow, rocky pathway</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Cedar Trail, and reaching Mrs. Kel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly's desolate shack, beat loudly upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She ain't home." said Mrs. Kelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">querulously, in response to his eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. "I guess you'd maybe find her</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at Ashby's, though the Lord knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I took her out of the 'sylum for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be traipesin' Lord knows where when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I need her--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe waited to hear no more, but, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinking heart, hastened back to Twi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. He inquired at each of the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses in the little town, but Cynthia</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been to none of them. He paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainly, then turned up the road to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the Junction. A wild' hope had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arisen in his heart that Cynthia might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching for him. At the bridge he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused again, looking darkly and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shudder at the turbulent water. A clat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of hoofs behind him, and Bess Ashby</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will search with you." she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a word they turned their</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses up the hill. Silently they rode.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The snow had hid all traces which pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing feet might have made an hour earlier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the dim light the pines threw faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows across the white road. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there a branch creaked softly. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles up they came upon a little red cape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Joe buttoned inside his coat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whether it had been there as he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down he could not tell, so intent had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">been upon the thing he had in hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. A few turns more and they found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow beaten down beneath a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree at the roadside, where she must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated herself to rest. On and up be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore them wound the still white miles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They rode-slowly, peering everywhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just once Joe spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bess, didn't you remember that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had 110 father, no mother--no one?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She had you" said Bess bitterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they reached the last stretch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights of the Junction gleamed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the little grove of aspens that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the clearing about the station.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a sudden impulse they reined in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their horses, and from behind a dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of cloud rose the moon, pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a white radiance. Bess strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes up to where Joe's house--her</seg><seg type="columnLine">house--stood across from the station, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe, with a sudden cry, leaped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and knelt beside a little huddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">form by the road. For a moment Bess</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled dizzily in her saddle, but when Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">called, "Go get Little Bob!" she drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself together and obeyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They carried Cynthia to Joe's house</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laid her upon the blue-covered couch</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Bess had selected in Salida with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such loving care and such tender hopes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little Bob built a roaring fire, and Bess,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with strange, cold heart and strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">numb fingers, went into the bedroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew the blankets--her blankets--</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bed to wrap about the uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious girl. When at last she opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">piteous eyes upon them, Joe and Bob'</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly withdrew. Outside the door Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized Joe by the arm, and shaking him</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly, dragged him into the station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What kind of a fool are you, anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Adams?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm all kinds," replied Toe with con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Want to kick the universe?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, want to kick myself almighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">good and hard!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say the word and 1 11 help." said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later Bess entered the station.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Cynthia wants you," she said briefly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe. When he had gone she turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply to Bob. "Send a telegram to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salida for me right away," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell Dr. Williams to get a marriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">license for Joseph Adams and Cynthia</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marsh, and take the eleven-forty train</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-night to Mears Junction without fail."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stood quietly by while the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument ticked off its knell to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness. Little Bob rose to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration shining in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Ashby," he said, "you're the fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est girl I ever met. By Jove, you are!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm proud to know you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    The gray dawn crept over the eastern</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  hills and slipped down into Twilight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pa spread his hands out over the kitchen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  stove, where the lire crackled cheerfully,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  and the coffee pot simmered fragrantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There," he said presently, "I hear the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  down train."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Mrs. Ashby opened the draughts and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  pulled the coffee pot forward. She had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  not slept. There were more lines in her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  face than had been there yesterday.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When at last the door opened and Bess</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  came in, she said nothing, but quietly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  moved about preparing a meal. Bess</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  took off her coat and sat down wearily,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  leaning her head against the dresser</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  shelves. From beneath her closed lids</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the tears fell slowly.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingered, longing in her eyes, envy in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. She could not afford a new hat at</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, although she had been the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman on the train that morning in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straw hat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Bob was going away, back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canal Zone, to finish his w'ork there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was going without having spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words that Florence had passionately</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to hear from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had grown up together, neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bors in the suburban town in which their</seg><seg type="columnLine">respective parents had elected to settle;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been unacknowledged sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts before this last contract had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to Panama. He had been away</seg><seg type="columnLine">three years, and he had come home a</seg><seg type="columnLine">month ago for a brief vacation, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though apparently he had been very glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see her again, Florence had missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lover-like quality that she had se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cretly expected to find in his manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward her. She could not help feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had disappointed him. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come up on the steamer with some New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York girls, "classy girls" he had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed them, and several times he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">declined invitations to affairs in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suburban home town, because he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been asked to some party in New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Florence knew that she could not com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pete with "classy New York girls." Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">people were in moderate circumstances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at present, owing to general busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness depression, her father had informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sadly that he would have to cut her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress allowance in half until things took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a turn for the better. Under these cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstances a new hat was out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. She had indulged in new white</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves, she had had her suit pressed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and her pumps shined, but all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were discounted by the straw hat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">decidedly shabby after having done ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent service for four months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would not have mattered so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Bob were not so observant of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little details that w ent to make up a well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">groomed woman's toilet, but he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen eye for accessories, and Florence</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost wished that she had not accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belated invitation to lunch at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waldorf, though he had flattered her by</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisting that he wanted a farewell party</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her. She had hesitated, and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he was the one man she had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared for. she had put her pride aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had told him that nothing would</seg><seg type="columnLine">give her greater pleasure than a tete-a--</seg><seg type="columnLine">tete meal with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now she stood and gazed, and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling herself it was merely to pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the time, she stepped boldly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hat Shop. It did not entail any</seg><seg type="columnLine">obligation to look at the tempting wares</seg><seg type="columnLine">displayed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shop was crowded. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sale in progress, and women came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from both the avenue entrance and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one on the side street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saleswomen flew from one customer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another, frequently attending to half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen at one time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A showy blonde approached Florence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just look around and I'll be with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently. That woman in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror has tried on every hat in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place; she's got to decide on something</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon." she explained, with a sigh, as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemplated the fussy customer, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the shelf before her piled with hats</seg><seg type="columnLine">of every description. "Say, here's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobby little thing that would just suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Try it on, and I'll be back in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes." As she spoke the saleswoman</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangled in front of Florence's eyes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small draped turban of black velvet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornamented with one stiff wing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">YIELDING TO TEMPTATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"How much is it?"

And she pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hat into Florence's hands, and rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to where the fussy woman with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrath in her eye was waiting for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Florence had gasped at the price.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twenty dollars! If she had had her full</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowance and been ready to purchase a</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter hat, she would never have dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pay more than ten, and yet--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She glanced at her watch. Twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes to one. Still twenty minutes be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore she was to meet Bob at the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">near by. It couldn't do any harm to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">how she would look in a twenty-dollar</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She walked deliberately over to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the long mirrors in front of the show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases, removed the despised straw, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set the velvet toque primly on top of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">glossy brown hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another saleswoman passing took one</seg><seg type="columnLine">look and stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not that way, dearie. Allow me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with skilful hands she readjusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the toque, placing it at an angle that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so undoubtedly becoming that Florence</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself was amazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's better, isn't it? Get a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass and look at the back. You couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">find anything more becoming if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched a week." Then she went off</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Florence stared at herself, two spots</seg><seg type="columnLine">of color creeping up into her pale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth cheeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did not look like the same dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirited creature who had entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hat Shop ten minutes ago. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a radiant girl, sure of herself and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own attractions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She went in search of a mirror, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently found herself in another room</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite as crowded as the first she had en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, but after a time she discovered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">handglass and was able to secure a view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the toque from the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tears came to her eyes. What a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change a smart hat made in one's ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance ; but twenty dollars--it was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the question!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another saleswoman addressed her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time quite respectfully, not at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the patronizing manner employed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other two. "Take a seat, won't you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll be at liberty soon. That's a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">smart hat you have on. You did not get</seg><seg type="columnLine">it here, did you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately an impatient customer</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed the saleswoman's attention, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Florence was spared the necessity of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation, but a daring thought crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her mind. The woman had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized the hat as belonging to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock, and yet she had only passed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one room in the shop to another. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps the stock in the two rooms was kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate. She edged toward the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suppose she walked out boldly, wearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twenty-dollar hat, would any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to stop her?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She glanced again at her watch. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes to one! She was a block from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Waldorf, and Bob hated to be kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her hand was on the knob, and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">she hesitated. It would be stealing, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she only wore it to lunch and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned it afterward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unconsciously she turned the knob,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the next moment she was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. Bob should go away with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of her looking quite as smart as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girls he had been running around</seg><seg type="columnLine">with lately. When he got back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panama he should not remember her as</seg><seg type="columnLine">shabby in a last summer's straw; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should recall her as she had sat opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him at luncheon in a toque copied</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a French model.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she reached the sidewalk her heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in her mouth. Suppose some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">had noticed her and.she was followed?</seg><seg type="columnLine">She could say it was a mistake, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But no one followed her. She gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the avenue, waited for the signal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross, entered the revolving doors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostelry from the Thirty-fourth street</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, and caught a glimpse of Bob in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes brightened as they took her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in admiringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some class to you to-day, Flo. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunning you look!" he said, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">BREEZY STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped his band tinder her elbow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">g-tiided her toward the dining room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not until they were seated at a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">table near a window did Florence's heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">resume its normal beats. She was safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. No one would create a disturb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance in the restaurant, and she gave her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self up to the enjoyment of the hour be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore her. After it was over--if no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">were waiting for her outside--she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back to the Hat Shop, make some ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuse. and reclaim her shabby headgear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but for one hour she would bask in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration Bob took no pains to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ordered carefully, consulting her</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time to time, but she was content</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave everything in his hands. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not prevent her conscience from</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubling her, but her nervousness only</seg><seg type="columnLine">heightened the color in her cheeks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to the brilliancy of her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To cover her uneasiness she talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than usual, and Bob found'her a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most entertaining companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He suddenly began to regret that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had missed several opportunities of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joying Florence's society, and now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going away, to be gone for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">year, and other men would have time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover what an attractive girl she was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had alwrays been fond of Florence;</seg><seg type="columnLine">her memory had always remained in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">background as something solid he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to, but now he recalled that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been away for three years and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not seen so much of her during his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief vacation. His mind had been full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one of the girls he had met on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer. She was "some chickeif," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had delighted in rushing her; but, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, nothing cot;ld come of that. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a young engineer, drawing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">modest salary, and the New York girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told him frankly that she could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">afford to marry a poor man. Rob had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been at all sure he wanted to marry</seg><seg type="columnLine">her: she was good fun, but as a wrife--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he admitted to himself that a wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be more on the order of Florence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl who managed wonderfully on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small income. He knew her father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">position, and yet she contrived to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">smart and well groomed. He glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hat to her new gloves, lying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beside her purse on the table. That was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the kind of a wife a poor man wanted,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one who could put up a good appear-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ance on very little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To do Florence justice, she never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dreamed that the hat would carry Bob</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so far. She had merely wanted him to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">*	obtain a last impression of her which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shoukl compare favorably with the im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pression he carried away of other girls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She wanted him to remember her, well-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dressed and happy, not a pathetic little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">figure wearing her heart upon her sleeve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She never imagined that she wrould sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">denly become desirable, and so she was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unprepared wdien he began to attack her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for flirting with other men while he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grinding his life out down in Panama.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She was bewildered. She did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know enough about masculine vagaries</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to realize how in the twinkling of an eye</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she had changed for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As they lingered over their coffee he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fell into a sentimental mood. He de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scribed his lonely life in the Canal Zone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Of course, some of the fellows have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their wives with them, lucky dogs! A v</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl has to care a lot for a fellow to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">put up with conditions down there, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yet, after all, it isn't really so bad." He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">began to see how comfortable it would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be to have some one there with him,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some one like Florence, capable, clever,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attractive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She suddenly feared what wras com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing.

There seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing he could do or say. The doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor leaned over his desk and wrote pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scriptions. When he was finished, Deer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing spoke again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you sure, Doctor ? Is this final ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you mean that I won't ever be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able--" Dee ring's voice trailed off, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor ruminated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," he began slowly, "in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may outgrow this weakness. But just</seg><seg type="columnLine">now it wouldn't do. It wouldn't be fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the girl.

Deering put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prescriptions in his pocket and left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. On the street, a hurtling Decem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber wind caught him and left him shiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering on the curbstone. The air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with snow flurrying in nasty, vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious little squalls. It drove against him</seg><seg type="columnLine">maliciously, as though it bore him a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal grudge. Deering decided not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a car, but bent his head and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">head-on against the storm--block after</seg><seg type="columnLine">block. In his brain, the doctor's dictum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> x ou must not marry," kept Hashing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a monotonous recurrence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he began to think of her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strangely enough--or perhaps naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">--up to now it was only of himself that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had thought; that he must lose her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he must step aside and give her up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his life would be lonesome, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhappy. His own sense of loss was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which he had been conscious. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now he began to wonder how she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it. It would be a great shock to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her; everything had been arranged; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his ring, cards had been sent out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But people recover from shocks. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">would give him back his ring, the cards</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be recalled, and she would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">free.--Free!--That started a new train</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thought, opened a new vista of possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilities. Helen was very pretty, alto:</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether desirable. Others would court</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, of course. And, not immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a few moments afterward, it oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred to Deering that she might accept</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of these others. Before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">check it came an overmastering impulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to tell her of his trouble, to keep her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of everything. But it passed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly as it came, leaving behind it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of shame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he reached the drug-store. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told the clerk to hurry the prescrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions he felt the fatuity of his desire for</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste, of his having the prescriptions</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled at all, since the medicine held out</seg><seg type="columnLine">no hope either of health or happiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the candy counter he bought her</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorite brand. He never came now</seg><seg type="columnLine">without bringing her a half-pound box.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To-night he bought a pound. The sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gularity of the aberration struck him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he did not attempt to justify or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the drug-store to her house was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a short space, but the streets were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so thickly covered with snow and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind blew so fiercely that he made but</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow progress. Besides he was not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">PALS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a hurry; he felt none of the customary</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatience to see her. He was thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly; walking very slowly. So lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thought was he that he was uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of the fact that his left hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he could not get into his overcoat</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket, full with the candy-box, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">freezing. "How shall I tell her?'' he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking himself. And then: "How will</seg><seg type="columnLine">she take it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rang the bell the regulation num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of times. Instantaneously followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the click-click of the opened door. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up as he entered and saw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out to wait for him on the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing--a slim, crisp figure, in a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirtwaist and dark skirt clearly outlined</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the streaming light from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room behind her. He climbed the stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. As a rule he rushed up three</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps at a time. But to-night he climbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How slow you are," she laughed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she kissed him. "It's so cold standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. And I was so impatient."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He kissed her and hung his coat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rather decrepit hat-tree. "I'm warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough," he said, smiling at her. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked twenty blocks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took the box of candy from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcoat pocket and gave it to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My nightly tribute," he said, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She acknowledged it brightly. "Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">k-n-i-g-h-t-l-y tribute," she responded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased with her own cleverness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm a sorry knight," he said as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated himself wearily in the only arm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, where he always sat. She busied</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself with the candy-box, berating him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his extravagance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't allow these lavish favors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frank. You'll want to take me to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opera next. I'm going to make this last</seg><seg type="columnLine">so you won't have to bring me any to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow night. I won't allow you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend your income on candy, particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly as after a certain date it will be my</seg><seg type="columnLine">income."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it's your candy," he rallied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As between income and candy, I vote</seg><seg type="columnLine">for income. My business training hasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone for nothing, Frank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at her as she stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking a bon-bon from its bright tin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foil wrapping. She was very pretty,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">very dainty--her small nimble hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her slender round throat, her smooth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly-coiled hair. And a quick longing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her came over him with the poignant</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness that she was not for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he must not, even now, get up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair to take her in his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She saw him looking at her, quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid down the sweets, and approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Frank," she said slowly, "what's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a moment before he answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. "It's all off, Helen," he finally said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's all off?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Everything--the little flat, the trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Washington, the quiet little dinner for</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a few friends,--everything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Tell us about it, friend Frank," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So he told her and she listened. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">once did she interrupt. He finished with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words of the doctor; that in the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain future it might be possible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to marry, but that just now it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She grasped eagerly at the poor straw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did he say that.

And, seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brightness of her smile, he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went downstairs. She turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked slowly back into the room. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment her hands mechanically fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered the box of candy on the table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she fell on her knees to the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing bitterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They grew quite used to it during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next year. It was rather sweet, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship--their calm, quiet little talks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their modulated laughter, the unruffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth of their understanding. It was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they were two old people, Helen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes thought, two old people who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had loved in their youth passionately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted, and then come back to each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">after many, many years--subdued, chas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened by life, disenchanted, but not em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bittered. It seemed to Helen just like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. The time when they had loved as</seg><seg type="columnLine">young people love, seemed to her far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away; Frank seemed to her a past lover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a present one. And the sobriety of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their meetings, the new attitude they</seg><seg type="columnLine">took, the mature way they talked now</seg><seg type="columnLine">about things, led her to believe that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in truth much older than her years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for her the love of youth was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. Not because she made a conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to suppress it. but because the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire for it was somehow gone--as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">time had taken it away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yret she was delicate enough not to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frank see the growth of this involun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary indifference to the physical side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their relationship. For she could tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes by the way he looked at her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his manner of touching her that for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him she was the same as she had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">been--a girl, to be desired. This trou- „</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled her. She wished him to feel as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">did--as old. as settled, as removed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tempestuous, "silly" temptations</seg><seg type="columnLine">which young people are commonly lured</seg><seg type="columnLine">by. For her part she fancied herself free</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them forever--this tempered creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twenty-four.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for him. after the first month or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. when his disappointment was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">new, when the pain of renunciation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet fresh, it was easy for him to regard</seg><seg type="columnLine">her as a sainted creature, before whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wras only fitting to bow down, to touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverently. Was she not scarificing her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self for him--sacrificing everything?</seg><seg type="columnLine">But after a time it began to seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that it only could be so. Loving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, what else could Helen do? And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to think of her again as the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of flesh whom he adored: he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hope, to look forward to the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she would be his as she had before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was only by the exercise of great con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol that he met her 0:1 the plane they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had decided--"pals,'' friends who met</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other to talk, to be. as she put it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"sensible." And she, discerning this</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakness in him, feared increasingly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">PALS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">time when he would sweep aside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragile limitation? they had ringed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other. That, she felt, would spoil</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything. For she herself. si*e felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a proud sadness, was now beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptation She thought desire had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. when in truth it was only desire for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that she was free of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then *'BiUyr' Noble, newly grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uated from the law-school, came into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's office to stay. She had seen him</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times before--he would come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the holidays, go into the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked "Private,*' where his father sat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out smiling into everybody's faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">and go away again. Once he had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Good morning'' to her. It was a spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">day and he was sailing for Europe--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been evidently in a joDy mood. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall chap he was. with frank eyes, a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of li^nt. curly hair, and an easy, swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gait. He had never seemed to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reality somehow--she thought of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she thought of him at alL as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-mythical creature whom it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">absurd to consider in a personal rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion--as though he were a figure in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plav or a character in a book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now he came into the office where</seg><seg type="columnLine">site aw him every day. He dictated</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of his letters to her. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bug'' at the droll things she said. The}'</seg><seg type="columnLine">got on nicely.	«</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' &gt;ne day. when she had finished some</seg><seg type="columnLine">work for him. he asked whether he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might take her to dinner. She told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was engaged, though she did not add</seg><seg type="columnLine">'to he married." He apologized. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">that be seemed constrained in his man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner toward her, and she saw a good deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of him. That night though, as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">and^ Frank were sitting together in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuffy little parlor. Frank reading some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing elevating aloud to her. the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept into her head : *'I might be out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy Noble to-night- ' And, in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything she could do, the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About five o'clock one afternoon a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">months later, she and Noble were alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his office. He was in the midst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dictating a brief when he suddenly asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with entire irrelevance: "Miss Leighton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when are you going to be married ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' I dor. t know," she answered, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him fairly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You told me you were engaged--**</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' I'm not exactly engaged!

That Frank was ill:</seg><seg type="columnLine">tha: he might get well, but it was 'doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful: that he loved her; that she meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal to him. And there she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy Noble got up and squeezed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, lying idly on the desk in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a brick! he said.

When dinner was over, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked her to go to the theatre with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her face darkened: he wanted to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">why she couldn't come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must hurry home." she said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">''Frank is coming to see me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And when may I comer"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She began pulling on her gloves rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly.

And he irritated her slightly, too--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would touch her face and her shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. Finally she had to ask him, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply, to "be sensible." But he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">so hurt, so unhappy that a qualm of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morse swept over her. and she kissed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly--for the first time in months.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He misunderstood, and grasping her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him pressed his lips to hers passionately.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You darlingT* he whispered.

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't understand--you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course you don't/' she half</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbed. "You've spoiled everything!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apd she swept out of the room, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him miserable. But on the way home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured it out that she was probably ill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he determined to act the next day as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though nothing had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helen was very angry. She felt al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most outraged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was it--the very w'ord. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frank should thus intrude into the beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful calm of their "friendship" with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion, crass and earthly! It was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">illusioning. Why could he not be like</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself--purged of the weaknesses of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh, rarefied, etherealized by this trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble that had come to them?--Poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next night, she told Frank that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must not 'Met it happen again." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frank promised. But the next night it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. Helen was furious and did not let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him see her for over a week. When she</seg><seg type="columnLine">did he was humble, apologetic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You promised--" she began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he admitted, "I promised."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You were close to me and I--forgot."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You shouldn't forget," she said, a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildly, her aggressiveness softened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the almost comic meekness of his expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After all," she continued, "it's hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me, too--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it?" he asked eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You brave little girl.

Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen could have said would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">better calculated to keep their relation</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as she wished it. Her confession</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she, too, was a prey to temptation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pleasing to Frank's vanity and bol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stered his weakness. But Helen was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only partly pleased. For when she ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted that it was hard for her, she knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she deceived him. That he imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ined she missed his demonstrations of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">affection. She began to fancy she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done with that part of love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as to this she was soon disillu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioned. Being a clear-headed and ana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lytical little person, she became conscious,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his showing, unmistakably, the tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous, though unexpressed, admiration he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helen was not unschooled or uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious (had she not been for nearly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year engaged to a man?), but she chose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ignore these manifestations of his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest--love's antennae--on the principle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that to openly resent them would be em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassing and in bad taste. Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to her suddenly, like a shock, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she didn't really mind them. And merci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly her concise, business-like little</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain forced her to admit even more--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she liked them. That was danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous. Helen was sober-minded and hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est with herself. She decided, not so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">much that Billy Noble was dangerous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that she was in danger. And being</seg><seg type="columnLine">essentially discreet as well as honest, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">belonging to that variety, almost exclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sively feminine, which emulates in mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">als a standard analogous to that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marksman who measures his skill by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprising closeness with which he can</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to his target without actually hit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting it, she decided that the best thing she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do was to tell Billy Noble that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't see him again outside the beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of business. But when she did tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him so he laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," he had said. "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall we go to-night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when he saw that she meant it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">really meant it, he forced a compromise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pie must see her once more, just once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A hail and farewell to their friendship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She capitulated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well," she said, "once more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the last time--the very last--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went to dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting opposite her. in evening clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was pleasant to look at. Frank had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been looking thin lately, and seedy. Try</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she might, she could not keep these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as she saw Billy Aoble more and more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she took a pleasure in his presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ' quite apart from the mere innocent de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of companionship. Perhaps this</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization came indirectly as a result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">PALS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">little comparisons from cropping up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But after a moment the music, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good food, the pleasant surroundings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the restaurant, and Billy's jolly talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">made her forget Frank.

Her married life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her dreams, her hopes and joys had all</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to this.

A little cloud of pungent pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der smoke lazily rose, disintegrated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was carried away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clayton, in evening dress, stood stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pidly over the prone bodies of Marsden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lifelong chum, and she who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife. The revolver, given him by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead man on their first trip after big</seg><seg type="columnLine">game, was in his hand. It was an auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic, needing but the slightest pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let loose its messengers of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pool of blood from the breast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman stained the carpet a darker</seg><seg type="columnLine">hue. She lay as she had fallen, save her</seg><seg type="columnLine">right arm which, thrown up in protec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. had limply relaxed and settled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her side. Her heaving breast had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">still and no sound but the breathing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clayton broke the intense stillness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marsden, his features distorted in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-grin of fear, had not moved; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body lay crumpled as though every bone</seg><seg type="columnLine">were broken. A bell clanged somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the house, but Clayton took no heed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was followed by a crash, and a squad</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blue-coats led by the precinct cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain entered, with drawn revolvers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic was taken from Clayton's un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resisting hand and he was manacled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No questions were asked. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnecessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time passed unnoticed, and Clayton</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat mute and unseeing behind the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row bars. He slept and ate mechani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally. The protestations of friendship</seg><seg type="columnLine">and offers of help which had plenteously</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first reached his cell passed without</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, and now he was left severely</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only once did he speak--just before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the jury went out. The unwritten law</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his defense. He said but little--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word picture of his life as it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">before his one-time friend stepped in; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketch of his ideals, the feelings that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him when he saw his home had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been destroyed--that was all. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">again he sank into the chair, silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">morose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently a stir followed by a death-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like hush marked the return of the jury.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A deep voice sounded unnecessarily loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stifling stillness of the court room.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not guilty!" it said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As one in a dream Gay ton walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the place. He submitted passively</seg><seg type="columnLine">to congratulations. Dully, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, he answered business questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his lawyer--whose face bore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of conscious pride at the victory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A taxicab, called by a friend, stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the curb to receive him. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply reminded that he had not paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fare as he left the vehicle before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of his home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Home! The unspoken word jarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his nerves. Things were sadly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of place. Why did this picture persist</seg><seg type="columnLine">in staring at him? Why this odd Jap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anese chair, his last birthday gift to her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">always bar his way? All the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed wrapped in an atmosphere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom and despair: voices called from</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners, behind chairs, but the suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted electrics revealed no one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Petulantly he invaded the upper re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gions of the house. A drawer in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bureau slid open, creaking, to his pull.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A blued, burnished automatic, mate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that other, sparkled before his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unthinkingly his fingers closed over it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As in a dream he wandered back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that room he had left months ago, mana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cled, accused. He gazed unseeing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chilly, blued barrel of the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">MUTUAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand. His eyes strayed around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then fell on the dark stain on the rug.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He forced himself to look away--then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found the stain again before his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed to mock him and once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he heard it chuckle. His blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">froze in his veins as it dissolved, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape and showed--her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For many minutes he gazed into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. They were sad and reproachful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps, after all, he had been wrong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasty. He could see her as she looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first day they met--then as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked on their wedding day. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had killed her, perhaps without cause.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He forgot that a jury of his peers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquitted him--forgot everything ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept that now fear of the death to wfiich</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie had sent her was on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Summoning all his will, he tore his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze from the dark, ominous stain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again his eyes fastened on the blued</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle of the revolver. Nervously toy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with the safetyr catch, his fingers un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosed it. The whir of an automobile</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing on the Avenue grew less dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguishable. Then it took strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelled into an eerie moan of anguish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It sounded to him like an accusation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again he called on his will and uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciously his muscles tightened, answer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the leaping surge of his heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The double grip of the automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">released a spring hidden in its perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel heart. As quick as thought itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mechanism obeyed its law; an empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell flew out with a snap; there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull thud--then silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside, a blue-coat, idly swinging his</seg><seg type="columnLine">club and ruminating on the law which</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed a rich man to go free, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffened as the hound at bay. All sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of laziness left him and he bounded up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps of the mansion two at a time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A whistle sounded.
