A cheerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">road this, he reflected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would have been better, of course, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lain the night at the post and gone on</seg><seg type="columnLine">by daylight. But Captain Billings had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment that evening at Zaritzan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he meant to keep it. There was a commis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion awaiting him at Zaritzan, and he meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Billings had been stranded at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Astrakan, after completing a survey of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north coast of the Caspian for Governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beketoff, of that town. Beketoff had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">most polite, but being out of funds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">likewise out of favor with the territorial</seg><seg type="columnLine">ministry at St. Petersburg, Billings was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid. Nightly he had played chess with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">governor and sampled every vintage of wine</seg><seg type="columnLine">the castle boasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wine was not good, and Billings tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">of putting Beketoff to bed every evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the table. So he had borrowed a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony from the governor, and--since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not pay for a sledge--had entrusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his luggage to a detail of Cossacks under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sotnik, bound up the ice-coated Volga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now this luggage of Captain Billings was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very valuable, to himself at least. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time he had parted with it, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few days. It was a peculiar thing, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">luggage. But the Cossacks traveled more</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly than he, and Billings had sent word</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead by courier that he would be at Zarit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zan before midnight. He had a habit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping his promises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From time to time as he rode, he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch a glimpse of the gray sheet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Volga, somewhere to his right. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest had set in again arid the spruces made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corridor of the road that was merely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow track in the snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already the sun was behind the pines, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cold wind stirred up the fine snow into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a dust that stung his face. He pulled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sheepskin cap and fell to beating his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms across his chest. And he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice that the verst posts were no longer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen. In fact the trail he followed had</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowed down to the track of a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My faith, it's cold as - when the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">devil's gone to mass," Captain Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured himself. "And not so much as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tavern to break the hedgerows."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His gray-greenish eyes, spaced wide, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veyed the shadows of the forest slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His high cheek bones were reddened by long</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposure to the sun of the Caspian. Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of middle age with a back like a pike-</seg><seg type="columnLine">staff and a swagger to his shoulders that</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed his lack of height.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since boyhood--and a thankless one--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had grown up with weapons, lived by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wits. He wore no wig, and his yellow hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been bleached by the sun to the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tow. School had been, for him, the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prenticeship at the table of a master navi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gator, and the salle d' armes of a French</seg><seg type="columnLine">swordsman, now unhappily dead during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicissitudes of that changeful lady, Paris.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had not always found bread in plenty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there had been no lack of fighting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A pox on these misbegotten Muscovite</seg><seg type="columnLine">charts!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had noticed the absence of the verst,</seg><seg type="columnLine">posts. These, however, had been covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the most part by drifting snow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon had risen on his right, and by its light</seg><seg type="columnLine">he scanned the lines of the map of the fron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tier. According to it he should have been at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zaritzan by now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead, he was off the highroad. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could go back to the last post, or turn out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the river and wait for the sledge which</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be along that night. But neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice was to his liking. He tore up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthless chart and plied his pony's flanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the black Cossack whip he carried, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved to follow the track of the horse in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him so long as it led to the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if in answer to his decision, the howl</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a wolf came up the wind. Billings stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ied the pony, and settled himself in the sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle. He no longer needed the whip. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes narrowed against the cut of the wind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his glance thrusting into the shadows on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either hand, to pick out the yellow gleam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drawing off a glove, his numbed fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt of the priming of the long pistols in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Road of the Giants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle holsters; the snow had dampened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the trees were thinning; curling</seg><seg type="columnLine">wraiths of snow danced in the shifting moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light as the wind came with a sweep across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dunes of the open. A moment later he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew in his horse. Beside the trail a figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, standing over a dead pony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Zounds!" cried Billings under his breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Here's a merry go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The other, in a long kaftan and a tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheepskin hat too large for him, seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than a boy, a swarthy boy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes like black jewels. He held a simitar</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dripped blood upon the white surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the snow. Billings observed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat of the horse had been cut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Promptly the lad, who might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gipsy or Tatar, sheathed his weapon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood straight and quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Koshkildui, peace be with you, brother,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said Captain Billings in Russian.

There was an elusive</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">charm about the boy. Certainly, for all his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">respect, he did not speak in the manner of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a serf or a suppliant son of Egypt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings grunted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you are satisfied, step out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that he put spurs to the pony. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">native promptly shed his heavy coat and ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside, on the hard surface of the crust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to a stirrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How far is it to Zaritzan?" asked Billings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two leagues, good uncle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The black pest on those Russians!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this the youth glanced up, startled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings had been thinking of the discarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">chart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is this the highroad, young man?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nay, the road joined the river bank, well</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in the forest.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolves were near, so I cut its throat. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are in the forest again, and we must go</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that he was up behind Billings, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath warm on the traveler's neck. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his balance, the boy clung to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's belt, reaching around to the clasp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once the belt slipped, and the native tight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened it.

As if</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashamed of the mishap he leaped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, running beside the pony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although nothing more was heard of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolves, they set a good pace until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed an empty sentry box and, around a</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn in the road, sighted the black bulk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wall behind which rose the thatched roofs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of houses, and a watch-tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Zaritzan," panted the boy, pointing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light that showed by the stanitza gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" Billings dismounted. "A bowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hot porridge now, and some steaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can not enter Zaritzan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?

His expressive eyes were serious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he seized the officer's fingers and lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hands in the air, toward the south and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other quarters of the compass. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of his wrist was a cut over which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood had dried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On Billings' fingers was the stain of blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the slight wound over his knee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My lord," whispered the boy, "you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked in the face of danger for my sake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This night you have saved my life, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know not how. Now I have made us</seg><seg type="columnLine">atulas, brothers, as you first named me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And what foolery is that?"

His eyes flickered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the advancing sentry to Billings' face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Indeed, I will not. The wolves would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make marrow paste of the mare."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not they, my lord. The mare will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">under your hand within two days. Come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have given me something already,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Beel-ing. Are we not andas?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy stiffened, leaped boldly into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle, and was off pelting through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead bushes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon, my lord--brother," he called</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, laughing, over his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings snatched at his belt and shrugged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both his pistols were in the saddle holsters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His temper flared as he watched the mare</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rider go flitting along the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemlocks down toward the shining lane that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the moon's reflection on the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was rather curious, the ease with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tatar guided the tired horse away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter, riding as if he were one with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mare. There was no help for it. Horse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons were gone, and Billings felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss of both keenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A witch," suggested the soldier, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn close and was watching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings reflected that the sentry at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last post had told him to shoot down any</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatar at sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, he bewitched me jarely," he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, disliking the idea of arriving in Zar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itzan on foot, like a peasant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," nodded the soldier, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lanthorn close to his visitor. "I saw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">done.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was perplexing, after all, that the native had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown so little dread of the wolves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Lord be merciful to us!" The sentry</seg><seg type="columnLine">was staring at the cut in Billings' breeches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"See, there's where he sipped your blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They usually take the back of the neck, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the ear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Billings looked up, the man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">running toward the gate, stumbling over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">musket in his haste. Dropping the firearm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fumbled with the door to shut it. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a trifle too much for Billings to stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sprang into the opening, wedged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">boot against the door and flung it back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soldier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hide of Beelzebub--so you would leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Christian to the cold and the beasts, eh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">A sergeant, too, on my word."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Muttering that he had orders to admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">no strangers, the man changed countenance</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Billings thrust his musket into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, wheeled him about, and requested</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he announce to the pristof, Kichinskoi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Captain Billings was here from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Astrakan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At once--at once, your excellency.

The Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commissioner is expecting you, and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">word you were to go direct to his quarters."</seg><seg type="columnLine">But when Billings was not looking, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier backed away making the sign to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward off devils, with fingers crossed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings paid no attention to him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just discovered that the purse attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his belt for safekeeping had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE moon by now was well over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and the whole of Zaritzan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlined by the etching of shadow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was one of the forts just completed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">order of the Czarina, Catherine the Second of</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Road of the Giants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Russia.

The center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place was a square of beaten clay, a drill</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground in the corner of which, near the gate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood wooden stocks, a knout hanging there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on by a ru^ty nail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On one side of the enclosure ran a line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">barracks and stables. Clustered against</seg><seg type="columnLine">these as if for protection were the huts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">traders, wine sellers and smiths. Behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">these sheds a glow dimmed the moonlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and loud voices broke the silence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Groups of coated figures moved be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the huts, swaggering out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">square.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whenever the soldiers came near the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the drill ground they hushed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked more quickly.

Kichinskoi had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the adventurer was penniless and so the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pristof offered less than he had been instruct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to pay for the making of the map. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way of the world's officials to drive a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard bargain with him whose purse is</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. Billings had reason to know this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some years before he had commanded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russian sloop that made the voyage from</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Petersburg north along the White Sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thence along the edge of what was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">called "The Frozen Ocean" to the mouths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Yenesei, to establish a trading-route</seg><seg type="columnLine">for furs with the Mongol-Tatar tribes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arctic circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Russians bought, at very low prices,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge amount of furs annually from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatar tribes--"sea otters," sables, ermin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black and red foxes. Billings knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large portion of the great fur trade passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Zaritzan--the Torguts fetching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins from the interior--and a goodly inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est of the profits must stick to the fingers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kichinskoi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should return to Astrakan as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">my luggage arrives," he responded thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.

Even the Metropolitan of Mos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cow had been whipped by order of Cather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine, herself a profligate woman.

Our soldiers say he</seg><seg type="columnLine">calls them, from the steppe. The pristof,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Billings, would save the souls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heathen.

Dancers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cossacks and women who had been flinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves about until the sweat flew from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces and their hair came down--these</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to stare and cross themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elegantly dressed under-officials attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Kichinskoi's staff drew closer to inspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emblem on the clasp; uncouth-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cossack captains drew back with scowls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Billings was sensitive, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">acutely conscious of the belt.

It was up to the pristof</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clear him. But Kichinskoi was frowning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thin lips pinched together. He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">displeased at the quarrel, because the Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sack's words showed him how he might pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly humble Billings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the German woman, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been whispering to the Pole, spoke up</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrilly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A mounted patrol pursued the robbers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellency, and the sergeant in command</seg><seg type="columnLine">reports that the leader of the Tatars was</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding the horse of Captain Billings.

Suspicion leaped into Kichinskoi's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray eyes. He pondered the possibility that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings could have been sent by BeketofT</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stir up the Tatars to revolt.

Kichinskoi, seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his sofa was well out of the combatants'</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, leaned forward curiously. Hitherto</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one in Zaritzan had cared to match</seg><seg type="columnLine">strokes with the giant ataman.

The blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have broken the other's blade like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden lath.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in the eyes of the woman on the sofa</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a morbid eagerness.

So blinding was the play of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons, she feared that she might miss the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant of the blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop them!" cried Kichinskoi.

That is right and as it should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be.

No sooner had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polish dragoons come up and secured</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alashan than Mitrassof gave an order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men and marched off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the surprize of all the Russians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norbo and the other Tatars offered no</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance as Alashan was hurried to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The son of the Khan is the first," ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained Kichinskoi to Norbo.

You do not think I am a girl?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hereupon Nadesha, who had unbuttoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cotton jacket she had worn under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">khalat, began to jerk at the neck of her shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">with anxious fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must not give me to the soldiers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would strip me and take me to Kichin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skoi when they find I am not Alashan-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on!

He was committed now</seg><seg type="columnLine">to getting NUdesha out of this mess. Light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the candle, he saw that the Tatar girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was curling up in the blankets, preparing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bad idea," thought Billings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought the skins on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although he dozed, one ear was conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the coming and going of feet outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. He had fastened the inner bolt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently the feet began to run through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage; he was aware of shouts, the hoof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beats of a horse outside the house. A touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his arm wakened him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nadesha had put on the khalat but with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out bidding up her hair.

Looking from the panes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mica in the window, he whistled softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Against the spreading crimson of sunrise</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the east there rose numberless columns of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke. The whole sky was full of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">black pillars, so that the very dawn was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hue of blood. Listening to the outcry in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the castle he made out fragments: "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatars have risen. . . . The world is burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up. . . . Where are the Torguts? Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages are burning?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing tip-toe beside him, Nadesha</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at the conflagration. She uttered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft cry, of lament or joy, he did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">which. Tugging him after her, she drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the bolt and pushed open the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sentry faced her, dull with lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, his musket at the "ready." Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted, but Nadesha knocked up the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a quick motion--she moved as swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an animal--and drew from within her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloak a long pistol. Billings recognized it</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ThFUsting the weapon into the soldier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard, she backed him against the wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corridor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You little vixen!" 4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	Billings caught at her, but she slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, running fleetly in her bare feet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">map-maker dashed after her, leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentry fingering his weapon and cursing,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not daring to shoot for fear of hitting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down the passageway they went, into an</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty hall and through a door that gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a lighted chamber. This proved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the office of Kichinskoi, and the pristof</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself sat at the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wore a purple dressing-gown, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair was tousled. He was alone. As Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran into the roOm, the door was swung shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him and, wheeling, he saw Nadesha</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing against it, flushed with triumph, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol in each small fist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With her bare feet planted wide, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled hair falling into her gleaming eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl was a veritable wildcat.

Nor, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discipline he enforced among those under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rule, was there a chance that any one--</seg><seg type="columnLine">except Mitrassof--would enter without</seg><seg type="columnLine">permission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kichinskoi was cornered and he wa,s help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less.

"You</seg><seg type="columnLine">and your Empress would make slaves of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">free born. Fool! You did not see that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not submit. Many there were who</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the truth for your hearing. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut your ears. Now, have you seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke in the sky?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A nod from Kichinskoi, who was gather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his wits about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Torguts are burning their villages;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bear is throwing off its shackles.

Soldiers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">running to stations, Cossacks who buckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">belts and slid into overcoats as they ran.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the watch-tower a bugle blared. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">meti paid no heed to him, or to Nadesha.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he had hoped, the captain sighted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long cloak and flying hair of the girl disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearing into the mist. She was looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">back over her shoulder. Somewhat to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprize she was heading not toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stables but to a gate through which horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were coming and going freely, men from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mounted patrols coming in and couriers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">going forth. The usual strict scrutiny was</seg><seg type="columnLine">relaxed owing to the absence of both</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mitrassof and Kichinskoi and the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbance caused by the conflagration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the shreds of mist Nadesha seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a floating wraith slipping over the snow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just within the gate Billings sighted a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleigh and recognized, by its gilded orna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and pompons that it was the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">used by Kichinskoi himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beside it the young Polish lieutenant sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">his horse restlessly. Into the sleigh was</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing the plump woman who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kichinskoi's mistress. Her maid, lugging</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandboxes and shawls was trying to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">in beside her. Not ten feet away stood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocks, and from the frozen body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">imprisoned Cossack, two blind eyes stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the tumult around the sleigh. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had died in the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In response to Nadesha's call three horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men emerged from the dense shadows of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.

He recognized the harsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">features and immense shoulders of Norbo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master of the Herds. Another was a youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of about Nadesha's age. The three evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently knew exactly what was expected of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norbo spurred up to the Pole, who drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pistol from a saddle holster, but not quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to avoid a sweep of the club in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norbo's hand. The pistol was knocked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow, the Pole himself caught up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled from his mount and flung to earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the other two had frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the two grooms with a flourish of bared</seg><seg type="columnLine">sabers. Nadesha, as usual, had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">idle. Seizing the maid by the shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl pulled her back, screaming like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded parrot. The bandboxes flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, and the horses attached to the sleigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The German woman had risen, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward jerk of the sleigh tumbled her back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadesha wormed into the vehicle and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rolling the frightened fugitive out of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norbo rode up impatiently and put an end</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this by leaning over and pulling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman bodily out of rugs and sleigh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadesha screamed something up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatar, who turned and looked at Billings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain had come to a halt.

The goat tamasha, in which each</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider tries to capture and keep from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others a live goat, is a furious test of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour or more during which clubs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracked heads are often the lot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contenders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are worse than a hair on the eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball," Nadesha had assured him spitefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">after one defeat.

The wild-swine</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunts by torch and moonlight, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickets coated the valleys, were less arduous!</seg><seg type="columnLine">but more hurtful. Many an overbold</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripling had the calves of his leg ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart by angry tuskers, and some were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham-strung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alashan's body was more delicate, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes deeper than usual.

Dart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the entrance, she crawled out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spring to the ground and look about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She saw only the herd of horses and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other side of the yurt, his teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">set and his eyes savage, Alashan spurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, plying his whip as if one of the thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand devils had climbed up behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadesha and the son of the Khan had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">betrothed in childhood.

The cold was intense, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky was clear and the sun's touch fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">full on the deep blanket x)f snow that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not soften.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the fir belts, animal life kept together</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively--elk, and the following wolf</seg><seg type="columnLine">packs that ranged from forest to river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even the rivers were motionless, ice coating</seg><seg type="columnLine">their surfaces. Yet across this frozen world</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved a black river. It was a stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fur-clad humans, and as village after village</seg><seg type="columnLine">was met with and the smoke of them left</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, the column grew to an army, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">army to a horde.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of it became a never ending</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutter, compounded of the groaning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-driven beasts, laboring wagons and</seg><seg type="columnLine">toiling men. And this muttering horde of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, going as no people had gone before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unwonted. It broke, as one might say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chains set about the steppe; it challenged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wilderness. Before it, as if in mute</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of this, the elk herds, the wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">swine, even the panthers fled out of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But behind it the wolf packs began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather, tearing to pieces the cattle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses and sheep that fell by the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A whole people has gone mad," men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had come to look at the moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns from a distance said.

The head of a viper, cut off from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body, still retains its poisonous fangs:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kichinskoi, in the last agonies of mortified</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceit and dread, had ordered Mitrassof</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take up the pursuit of the Horde and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut to pieces any clan that refused to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him to its residence on the Volga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shortly thereafter the doors of a prison</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell closed on Kichinskoi, and before the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of^that Winter he died. But Mitrassof had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his orders, and he carried them out. General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Traubenberg also was moving across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Volga with a heavy force of infantry an 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">artillery; but unlike the Cossack he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his time prudently and when he did come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">up, it was upon the scene of the disaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Ukim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although the Horde made the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Volga to the Yaik, three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty-odd miles, in ten days, Mitrassof</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught up with the rear guard of two clans</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the near side of the Yaik.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carrying out his instructions, he attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yeka Zukor clan when it refused to sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">render to him, and his veteran cavalry swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the Tatars of that tribe. Disheartened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other clan gave up and returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Volga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This defeat caused the Horde, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted on a week at the Yaik to rest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts, to move forward again in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loss of nearly half of their cattle from</seg><seg type="columnLine">overdriving.

The Tatars, know-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing little of religion, respected the Dalai</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lama as a matter of course.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatars, intent on the astonishing confes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of Nadesha, did not pay attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newcomer. They craned forward, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">one anxious to see for himself the two belts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zebek Dortshi ran his fingers through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft beard and his eyes narrowed. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most far-sighted of the leaders of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatars.

She would, out of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horde, be a fitting match for the chief of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red Camel clan. She had wit, fire; she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sluggard, to be hugged and forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now she had named as her pledged</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother a foreigner, a Christian and impecu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nious prisoner. Zebek Dortshi knew there</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be a reason for this. He thought she</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved the Englishman. Speculatively the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noyon glanced at Billings, who stood quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting the tip of the rapier on the floor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yurt. What kind of metal was in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are a child, Nadesha." Zebek</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dortshi's brow cleared. "And a child at</seg><seg type="columnLine">play.

Then watch if this be</seg><seg type="columnLine">play!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She drew from her belt a curved dagger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flourished it in his beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among the followers of the noyon there</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Road of the Giants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was hesitation.

They knew, likewise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if they rushed the prisoner, Nadesha</seg><seg type="columnLine">would probably be severely hurt, if not</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed. She might even kill herself--there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no telling what a woman would do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then, while they muttered and fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered their weapons, Billings took matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his own hands.

But the words re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased the floodgates of Tatar fury.

As he stepped under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the candle on the tent-pole, he threw back</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hood and faced about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alashan!" cried Zebek Dortshi, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted to his men to hold off .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy's thin face was strained and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glowed. He leaned down to twist</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dagger from Nadesha's hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will deal with this man," he said pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionately to Zebek Dortshi. "Call away</seg><seg type="columnLine">these dogs and be gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although he was half a head shorter than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall noyon, his anger made the Persian</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrink back a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am the son of Ubaka Khan," he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, "and I will attend to this one whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadesha calls anda.

Now, get to your horses before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norbo's men cut your hearts out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flinging down the dagger, he clenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fists, looking up from face to face as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">marking those who were present. Zebek</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dortshi trembled with fury, and was pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back by his men, who had heard horsemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were entering the camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Norbo--Norbo!" cried the girl. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadesha!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the Master of the Herds strode forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, the men of Zebek Dortshi gave back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling their hoods down as if not eager to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be recognized. Norbo climbed slowly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor of his yurt and looked about him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Khan of the Red Camels has come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pay his respects to me," said Nadesha</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. "With a score of armed men he</seg><seg type="columnLine">'came, to take the one that is my prisoner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giaour.

Zebek</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dortshi was thoroughly angry, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">discreet. Chewing at his beard, he sheathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sword and bent his head very low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mockingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take heed, O master of the house, lest</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day your seat in the council be vacant."</seg><seg type="columnLine">As Norbo said nothing more, the man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irak beckoned to Alashan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, puppy--they growl at us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the boy raised his hand in greeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Norbo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May the road be open before you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master of the Herds.

After</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Billings had warmed his feet and hands at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the flames and was returning to his bed, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">khan spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Keep that stick in your hand, giaour,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and sleep upon it. There are dogs about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You may need to use it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Until then Billings had wondered how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long he would be permitted to retain his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sword, for he knew Norbo must have noticed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that he still had it. Following the old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man's advice, he thrust the blade in its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scabbard well down among the skins and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rolled himself up for the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Turning over presently on his elbow at a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">" sound from the hearth, he found that Norbo</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had secured the sketch that was the begin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ning of his map and had turned it to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light. The scalp-locked head of the Tatar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was nodding over it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, he knows good work when be sees</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it," thought Billings drowsily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   In reality Norbo had fallen asleep sitting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up and was utterly indifferent to the map.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Through the closed flap of the yurt there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came the clang of a brazen basin--the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gong that marked the hours for the camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was answered by the distant blast of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horn. Norbo raised his head inquiringly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but the trumpet was( that of the lamas..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Presently the Tatar began to snore, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a sighing sound like the sucking of the wind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in and out of the tent. From Nadesha's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">comer a murmur merged with the note of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the storm. The girl wras crying softly, her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arm pressed against her mouth so that she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should not arouse the two mpn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGHOUT the ten days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feasting while the snow lasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alashan kept to himself. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, frosty weather set in, he waited im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently until the wind died down and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting of the dunes over the steppe ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The dawn trumpet of the thirteenth day</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">filled him with a glow of eagerness. He was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to ride with the advance guard of the Horde</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that would make forced marches to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ukim Pass. They would try to gain the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upper gorge before the Cossacks; if the Cos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sacks ■were there first, there would be fight-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing anyway. This was what Alashan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">longed for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would show his hardihood in battle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ubaka Khan, his father, would declare</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a man, with all a noyon's estate. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not until then could he challenge Bill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, the tow-headed Christian officer, to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">combat with swords. The captain, Alashan</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, would refuse to match weapons with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boy. In imagination, when he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, the son of the Khan pictured his</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved sword biting into the stalwart neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stranger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What tormented him was the favor shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Nadesha to Billings. When Alashan</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of her looking at Billings and smil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the quick, Russian words of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger--words that he did not hear--his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart pounded and his teeth drew back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his Ups.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he urged his camel up with the scouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his company. His father had placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with the captain of two hundred musket</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, mounted on picked Bactrians. Zebek</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dortshi commanded five hundred other</seg><seg type="columnLine">musket men, veterans of the war with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turks, and the Persian had gone ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere to the right of Alashan's de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tachment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind the two camel corps rode a regi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of mounted infantry, followed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nucleus of the Khan's heavy cavalry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were soon lost to sight in the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outriders informed the Tatar captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Russians were pressing forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly from the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a race for the rocks of the Ukim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my young kinglet," he confided to Alashan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aye, the power of the gods of the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">places must aid us.

Alashan</seg><seg type="columnLine">fretted himself by trying to make his beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">race ahead of the others, and a dozen times</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fingered over the priming of the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol he had at his belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His young eyes were keen, and before noon</seg><seg type="columnLine">he made out that mounted men were mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing within the black sides of the gorge. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that the Ukim Pass was like the neck of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a squat bottle. Only at the summit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass were the sides of the gorge precipitous;</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the main slope, a wilderness of rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot through with outcroppings of pillar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like basalt, stood on either hand amid a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scum of bare Tamarisks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alashan's first thought was that Zebek</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dortshi had beaten him in the race to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ukim, and he gritted his teeth. The cav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alry on the slope below the pass were mount-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed on camels and seemed to be awaiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The gods are kind!" he cried suddenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It was well I made gifts of gold and Rus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian money to the priest Loosang.

I see the sun on their breast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces and their long lances."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Tatar chewed his mustache and</seg><seg type="columnLine">squinted. Four--six hundred men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass, he reckoned. Why, by the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse of Kaidu, had they not gone higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they would have the cliff on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">flank?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Their beasts are tired.

Their own mounts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stumbling and groaning; they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">relish facing the heavy sabers of the Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacks. Out of the corners of their bleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes they looked at Alashan. What would</seg><seg type="columnLine">the son of the Khan do?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, my brothers of the tents," shrilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alashan.

Their camels</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone farther than ours this day--they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">barely can stand. Let us ride them down!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instinctively he exhorted his men. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain was in a whirl. Never had Alashan</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridden into the shock of battle; his limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivered, and his lips twitched. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were glued on the horsemen above and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of him who sat waiting in ranks like</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting wolves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Tatar captain glanced around hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make out some trace of Zebek Dortshi's</seg><seg type="columnLine">command. There were no other tracks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen in the snow; but his keen eye caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light in the weather-hardened faces of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Fatigue had vanished. %</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us ride after the boy," they said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to another.

They are many--we will go from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this spot up into the gate in the sky, over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains of Natagai where the tengeri</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride on the wind. That is good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Only the eyes of the captain were</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled. When the opposing groups halt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, at the distance of a bowshot, to revile</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other and pick out an opening for attack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alashan's blood began to hum in his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If only the thing would begin! The sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was running down his legs; he feared every</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment his camel would bolt, or he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgrace himself in some way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His men were shouting guttural chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenges at the splendid-looking Poles, calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">them hired women and blood-sucking in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects, and steel-bedizened jezebels. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">round-faced Poles did not understand, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cossacks flung back fitting answers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho, gutter-bred thieves--mud-puppies--</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneaking sons of dogs--turn-coat infidels</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">who run from a good, Christian sword-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crash! A burst of musketry from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russian ranks emptied some of the Tatar</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounts and sent the hot blood into Alash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">an's burning eyes. He did not notice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the answering volley of his men went wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the most part, that the Tatars followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their noyon up the slope in scattered forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, while the disciplined Poles kept well</seg><seg type="columnLine">together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt his teeth chatter together, saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion, the old captain, shoot an arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the beard of a short Cossack, only to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck from his horse by a back-handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow from a huge soldier whose open coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailed after him like a cloak as he cast him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self into the Tatars, hewing forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and roaring even after arrows stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from his ribs and arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The giant was finally brought down by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the fall of his pony, and sat down in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">snow with his head bent while his shaking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands fumbled for the ikon under his shirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The snapping of pistols sounded far off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Alashan came out of his stupor with a jerk,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and was mad with rage on the instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tugging at the nose cord of his beast, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">almost ran into a boyish-looking Pole who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cast a lance at him. Alashan pulled the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trigger of his pistol and saw the other's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">surprized face staring at him out of a cloud</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Without waiting to see if the Pole fell off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his camel, the son of the Khan sprang down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and secured a more agile mount, a riderless</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pony. The red mist was still before his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eyes as he dashed here and there, striking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and parrying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Meanwhile the fight had dissolved into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">group combats, in which the Tatars were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">outnumbered and cut down rapidly, being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unable to inflict serious damage on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">armored Poles. Only the natural agility</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the steppe riders and the deadly use they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">made of their short bows kept up the sem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blance of a struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Half of them had their wish, and went to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the land of Natagai, which is in the sky,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">behind the flaming gate of the northern</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Alashan halted, perforce, seeing no foes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">before him. He had come through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ranks of the Russians. A louder crackling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of muskets caused him to stare to either</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side. •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From behind boulders and tamarisk</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickets Tatars were firing down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russians. They were advancing coolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the slopes of the gorge on foot, kneel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Alashan blinked and wondered if he were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dreaming. Then he made out the brilliant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">figure of Zebek Dortshi sitting his horse on a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">summit nearby. When he shouted orders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to his lieutenants, the noyon took a pipe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from between his lips. Presently he raised</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his voice to call to the remnant of Alashan's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men, bidding them withdraw a short dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tance and form again. The red cleared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from Alashan's eyes. He felt the sweat,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now cold on his limbs. Another was giving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">orders to his men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The death of the Tatar captain had left</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Alashan in command of the camel corps, or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what remained of it. He knew Zebek</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dortshi must have seen him, and yet the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">noyon paid no attention to the boy, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cut off from his own following.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anger quickened Alashan's pulse; and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled his horse, heading back toward his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. He went for them direct, on a course</seg><seg type="columnLine">that took him through the scattered groups</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Poles and Cossacks, who had been thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">into confusion by the fire of the Tatars in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This uncertainty saved Alashan his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While some Russians were turning, to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gallop up into the safety of the gorge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the lines of Zebek Dortshi's musket</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, others were still facing the Tatars be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alashan cut off the head of a Polish lance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimed at his ribs, and broke his sword in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's back as he passed. Dodging</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there, he edged through the Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacks, who would have given more heed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unarmed boy if they had known that</seg><seg type="columnLine">here was the son of the Khan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching his followers, who greeted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an exultant shout, Alashan led them</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the slope again. But the fight at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the Ukim was about over. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">camels of the Russians were giving out, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched themselves groaning on the frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth while their riders were cut down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zebek Dortshi's men, now mounted again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Cossacks tried to rush the rock nests</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the tamarisk, and most of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked off by bullets and arrows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing that only a handful of Poles re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained, standing back to back using their</seg><seg type="columnLine">light lances as spears, Alashan left these and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode up to Zebek Dortshi triumphantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Persian Tatar was still on the summit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking out over the plain. Alashan noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the tracks in the snow that the noyon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought up his men quietly, on foot, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thickets, coming in from either flank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The camels had been herded some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rear of the rocks until it was time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A suspicion came to Alashan that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noyon had been among the thickets for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time, that Zebek Dortshi had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first on the scene, arriving from the south,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his approach concealed by the foothills of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ukim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where were you, ahatou--brother?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed Zebek Dortshi indifferently. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not see you at first. Why, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of a thousand devils, did you try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride through the whole Muscovite strength?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If it had not been for the fire of my men</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Road of the Giants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you would have been hunted like a hare!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It occurred to Alashan if Zebek Dortshi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had noticed his feat, the noyon must have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> caught sight of him before then. If so why</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had not Zebek Dortshi called to him, or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sent men to protect the son of the Khan?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Alashan was too pleased with his first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> battle to wonder about things. He had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> reined his horse through four hundred foes!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had killed his man more than once and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> broken his sword into the bargain!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Moreover he was sure blood was mingling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> with the cold sweat on one shoulder, and a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> piece had been slashed out of his boot. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> gazed at that boot proudly. Then he gave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "There are men on the plain. They are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fighting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zebek Dortshi looked at him sidewise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and rubbed the gold-inlaid hilt of his sword.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Chu, my gamecock, did you not see that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the main force of the Cossacks had come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> up below us, and the heavy cavalry of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Khan, your father, close on their heels?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He considered Alashan for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Here, take my horse.

You will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> see more fighting down there-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Waiting for no more, Alashan was off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like the wind on a lean pony whose silver-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inlaid saddle was covered with a fine silk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cloth. In this way did Zebek Dortshi gain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">credit for giving the son of the Khan his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horse during a battle. And the noyon re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mained alone in possession of the coveted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gorge of the Ukim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Alashan passed groups of Tatars moving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> slowly over the plain, binding up their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> wounds and looking at weapons they had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> captured. These were the horserAen of uie</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bear clan, heavily armed and wearing chain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mail over their leather tunics. Their heads</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> v were covered with pointed steel caps and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> their black faces were scarred.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at the edge of a gully where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stony, dried riverbed v^as littered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpses. Several blue tops of Cossack hats</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to be seen in the center of a ring of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted Tatars who pressed them back</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the bank of the ravine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alashan heard the voice again, wild and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exultant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          "Shen, shen, shivagen,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          Swing the steel, swing again!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          Ride, ride, to our play,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           Slay, slay!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shadows, gathering in the gully, concealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outlines of the fighters, but Alashan</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the flicker of swords, heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moans of men who had fallen underfoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and listened to the deep voice of Mitrassof</seg><seg type="columnLine">making mock of his enemies. The Tatars drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at last, and some one called for a bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mitrassof was alone, half-standing, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying against the snow on the bank, his hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen off, his big head lowering on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">small fire glowed on some stones with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reddish hue. From it came a sweetish odor</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some dried roots. Behind the fire sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">what seemed to be a painted statue, draped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a yellow cassock, with waistcoat of cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold, and purple apron.

Loosang knew that Nadesha</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shrewd; he had watched the girl and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found her to his liking. "So you think the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day will soon be at hand when you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek aid of the gods?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye," the girl answered.

Loos'ang thought for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. "If the giaour is not given into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands by Ubaka Khan at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep evil will come against the Horde.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aye, for one thing--" his hand caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's wrist--"Alashan will be slain by your</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nadesha tossed her head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My thoughts are not for the son of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nor for the lion-haired giaour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here Nadesha took refuge in a smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of finding out things from the lama,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secrets of her heart were being probed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the Persian Tatar smiled it warmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood of men, for her lips were a lure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"True, my lama."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No more.

The masters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monks were warriors who wore gold and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet and carried standards as tall as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees.

So, to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, she prepared to play her part. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">even thought of the curious disappearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the money that had been brought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loosang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her own bag was visible in a corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yurt, but the store of coins that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed into the hands of the lama was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be seen.

He had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">eaten for two nights and a day, but tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the peak of his wooden saddle was a hind</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of an antelope, given to Norbo by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting party that he had met coming in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the marshes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old chieftain rode with his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised.

Billings had anticipated amuse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, but matters were growing serious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reined his horse up to the platform and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the wrist of the gylong. A heave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulders and the man was jerked back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fall into a mud puddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the yelling of the fat disciple</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought the watching Tatars nearer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A glance showed Billings that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a clan unknown-to him, and even in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage the gylong had been careful not to men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the name of the son of the Khan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The behavior of the two convinced Bill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings that Alashan had stirred up a hornet's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nest. Drawing his sword, he swung from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle to the platform, shoving off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened servant who had been holding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the reins. Alashan had disappeared within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yurt, and Billings was wondering what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy had seen. But by now the herds-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, convinced that something was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong, were beginning to run toward him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They shouted, brandishing knives and pikes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not so long ago Billings had encountered</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a mob. He realized that Alashan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone too far. With the fat priest crying</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on the Tatars would probably beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to a pulp before they listened to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">words from the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gathering up the reins in the hand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held his sword, he plied the whip that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been resting against the tent. Loosang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses were well fed, and there were six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. They lurched forward into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traces. Before the wagon could gain head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way a pair of lean herdsmen leaped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps and lifted their pikes. Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped the reins and was about to thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his sword, when he saw the two hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate and lower their weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The wolf of Nadesha!" one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were looking at his belt. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings did not wish to be taken in hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt or no belt. He shouted to the herds-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to give back and lashed out again with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his whip. The horses broke into a trot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then to a jerky gallop. The two invaders</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Others, spurred on by the gylong who</seg><seg type="columnLine">urged his horse frantically after the wagon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were running behind the yurt. A clamor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of angry yells rose above the creaking of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">axles and clattering of the wooden floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The yellow flag whipped in the wind; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamers snapped out from the eaves of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple tent. Dogs barked.	V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grinning, Billings plied the whip. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to him that Loosang might emerge</seg><seg type="columnLine">from within, and he kept a wary eye over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder while'he guided his imposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">chariot along the muddy plain. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make out two ample piles of skins, the beds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the disciples. Also a wine cask and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">array of foodstuffs, all jolting about. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell was ringing violently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tent bellied like a sail, and the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">portions were torn loose from the floor pegs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From this aperture Alashan peered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the mane of the white horse of Kaidu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what has happened?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking in the - situation, he smiled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckoned Billings. As they had outdis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanced the pursuers, the map-maker brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Road of the Giants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his steeds down to a trot and tied the reins</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a carved image of the sitting, Buddha.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind a curtain stretched midway across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tent he saw a figure lying on a couch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was clad in all Loosang's finery. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high, lacquered hat was the head of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">panther.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Billings looked, the eyes rolled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head toward him, and the jaw of the beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened a little. Overhead the bell began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to toll again as the wagon crossed some</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough ground. The flesh on Billings' back</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew cold. In the strong odor of the tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a smell of something unclean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look," said Alashan. Around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridgepole were arranged other heads, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of familiar animals, some of ghastly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscene shapes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A mask," muttered Billings. "What is</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing. Weights, hung under them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">move these eyes of painted mica. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">jawbone is loose. It is an effigy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To frighten those who might look in</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Loosang is away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye. But here is no sign of Nadesha."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruptly the wagon slowed, lurched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still, tilted to one side. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditched. Looking out, Billings saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony and Alashan's horse. A spear's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast away was Norbo with his two servants</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the pack animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alashan walked to the horse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master of the Herds and Billings followed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the Tatars stared in puzzled surprize.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luckily they were among a nest of dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickets and no others were in view at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. But Billings knew that the mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight of the sacred wagon across the plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been seen by many, and that presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fat gylong would catch up with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My lord," the boy saluted the chief-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain respectfully, "it is a lie that Loosang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body rests here while his spirit is abroad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here is only a mask and garments. Loo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang has gone from the Horde. Nadesha</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not to be found. She has spoken with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He is a master of evil, to my mind. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have read in his eyes that he lusts after her."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unexpectedly the old woman servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke up, seizing the stirrup of the noble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My lord, chief of the ulus, it is said in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents that the shape of the lama was seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the night before last, riding like a demon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as tall as a tree, and attended by his familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the form of a woman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whither did they turn the heads of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses?" asked Alashan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who knows, my young lord?

In the northeast comer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">. picture of a tower and the legend "Son-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kur." A mountain was drawn close by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is in the air and in the water and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand," muttered the old woman, "so the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kara Kirghiz say--the Black Kirghiz</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribesmen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his sword's point Billings traced an</seg><seg type="columnLine">equilateral triangle in the mud; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at the sun, reflecting dimly from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray haze. With a last look at his map he</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced it carefully in his coat and thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sonkor lies in that quarter"--he pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his sword "--two days' and one night's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard riding."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every one except Norbo drew back hasti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly from the triangle in the mud, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">surveyed Billings expectantly. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely magic! Billings, with the knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the gylongs would arrive very soon in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thicket, had done some rapid thinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The map--unreliable as to distances--</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him that the temple of Sonkor lay near</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains, at the edge of the river Chu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which flowed from the mountains of Tibet far</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the southeast. So the old woman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">proclaimed--near the heights, the sand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A single rider moves more swiftly than</seg><seg type="columnLine">an army; -Loosang would have left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horde before they reached the point nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Sonkor. At the end of nine days he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be back again; so he could not give more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than four days to each half of his journey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because even a Tatar jigit would need</seg><seg type="columnLine">some hours' rest and a change of horses at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sonkor. Admitting that Loosang was trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elling over the lower sides of his equilateral</seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">triangle, and the Horde had journeyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the northern side for a day and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half, it was easy to see that Sonkor lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two days and some hours and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south by south east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings was sure of this when he ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served that the route he had figured for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loosang and Nadesha skirted the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kangar.

Alashan turned to his horse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Norbo spoke for the first time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have not asked permission of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, the Khan, to leave the Horde."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadesha was greatly loved of Norbo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All three knew that if she had gone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loosang to the place of the lamas it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be only by the rarest of good fortune that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would regain the Horde. Loosang, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired the girl, would not bring her back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the protection of her father and Ubaka Khan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the Master of the Herds, who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not leave his post, reminded Alashan that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was the son of the Khan and might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the Horde unbidden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peace be with you, uncle," said Alashan</seg><seg type="columnLine">moodily.

The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant who had been watching from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicket reported the approach of riders</seg><seg type="columnLine">led by the priests.

Come, it is time--</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They mounted, Billings stiffly, Alashan</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a spring. The boy glanced over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Which way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surveying the sea of dunes, Billings noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the position of the purple finger of basalt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Away from this he turned his horse's head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Alashan followed without comment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boy rode like one possessed, pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the strips of clay that offered firmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">footing than the sand on the tops of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridges. He changed from horse to horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">without halting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first Billings glanced at the boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">expecting him to halt, to eat. But Alashan</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled some of the dried meat from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a saddle and went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings removed his tattered coat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied it behind his saddle, and then his</seg><seg type="columnLine">waistcoat followed suit. He felt little</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief. Then he tried chewing some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meat, but that increased his thirst.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently Alashan pulled down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft bottom of a gully. A line of tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two camels with riders," muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alashan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took the lead, following the tracks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They led slightly across the course Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been on. Before long other traces</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined the camel tracks. Alashan studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, dismounting in order to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can you say of this, my giaour</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Utilizing the pause to fill his pipe, Bill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings shook his head good-humoredly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing, except that they be horses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Horses of the Black Kirghiz. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are shod with yaks' hide, fastened by wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en plugs that leave traces in the sand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hm," said Billings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had heard Nadesha say that the Kara</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirghiz were mountaineers, the most pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erful tribe of Central Asia. Also, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally in league with the Baskirs from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steppe, the most bitter foes of the Torguts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alashan's green eyes were triumphant</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the knowledge that he had divested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">older man of leadership. Not Billings'</seg><seg type="columnLine">fault, for the maker of maps had been un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to bring his compass and the sky had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been clouded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is,another trail!" he exclaimed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This proved to be other horses, again two.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before an hour had passed a fourth trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into the main track. Billings re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected and turned to the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Kara Kirghiz live in the hills to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south and east, the Hindu Kush. Four</seg><seg type="columnLine">pairs, or at least three, are riding swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">back through the desert. Do you see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning in that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For answer Alashan's lip curled. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant that each man of the Black Kirghiz</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a spare horse--and so was equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fast travel. It meant, too, that four</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders outside their ov/n lands were meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a rendezvous in the heart of the Kangar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Black Kirghiz are dogs and thieves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have sent men to spy on the Horde.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are returning with news of what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kai--it is so." Billings nodded. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was their meeting place in this pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gatory of God?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy was indifferent. Nor did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the precaution of riding below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridges they had been following. Billings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, was interested in the question</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a landmark. How could four riders</seg><seg type="columnLine">have met--or at least turned into a common</seg><seg type="columnLine">path--within six miles? He studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon and presently touched Alashan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg with his stirrup.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ahead of them was smoke, rising from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clump of dead trees. Alashan declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tents were visible in the thickets under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gnarled willows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would have gone ahead, into the en-/</seg><seg type="columnLine">campment, thinking only of finding his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once to Sonkor and Nadesha, but Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuaded him to circle the spot, keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the sand ridges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If they watch, it would be toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north," he ejxplained, and the boy reluc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tantly consented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They found the place to be a village, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretched shepherd's huts and a herds-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man's tent, by a pool of muddy water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The peasants were away in the willow</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumps along the dried river bed in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pool stood. The women and children</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran and hid at their approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But on a bench outside a clay hut, Ala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shan found a Baskir man, dead drunk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dromedary knelt by the desert rider, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his sprawling feet was a sack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">varied spoil.	\</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Baskir fell in with the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">men by chance," observed Alashan. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a skinful of drink to loosen his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue and find out what he knew. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rode away to the south, as thevtraces</seg><seg type="columnLine">show, in haste--because they did not lift</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plunder. We will do so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sorted over the contents of the bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found a soiled Cossack svitza or woolen</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat, together with a fine red sash and green</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk neckcloth. Rummaging further, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew out a greasy lambskin cap. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">things he gave to Billings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When we are outside the village you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must put them on, my comrade," he pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. "The Baskir son of a dog has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbing the dead in the path of the Horde."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared moodily at the snoring raider,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and proceeded to strip him of khalat, panta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loons, leather leg wraps and turban. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was too dark to follow the tracks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirghiz they halted and gathered some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dried tamarisk branches for a fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighting it in a deep hollow screened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes While the flame was bright Ala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shan trimmed Billings' beard with his knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shaved off the long hair back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead. Then the maker of maps</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped to his shirt and boots and pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rough nankeen breeches, the silk</seg><seg type="columnLine">sash and the heavy svitza.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The garments were rich in material and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though slashed and stained, were nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">new. Billings wrapped the green cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his neck and thrust the hat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of his head as he had seen Mitrassof</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. He had the erect carriage of a soldier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so the Cossack garments did not look</seg><seg type="columnLine">amiss on him. Moreover the sun had</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned his skin to the hue of leather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile Alashan had done likewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Baskir's outfit, screening his long</seg><seg type="columnLine">black hair with the loose folds of the tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ban that came down to his shoulders. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's chin was lean, his nose thin and down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved, so that he fitted into the part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a desert man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Road of the Giants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alashan looked up and his'eyes narrowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had not known Billings would be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking a figure in Cossack dress. "A real</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallant," he told himself, and his eye fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the belt with the wolf's head that Bill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings had cast carelessly into the sand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Would you part with that?" he cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"With what?" Billings glanced down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistled reflectively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If they were to go into Loos&amp;ng's temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and he had given up hope of overtaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lama before then--he could not well</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear the emblem of a Tatar clan. Alashan</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself had suggested the disguises as</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary when he saw that the Kara Kir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghiz were afoot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Alashan," he suggested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"why don't you keep the thing, under your</seg><seg type="columnLine">girdle? Nadesha is your girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy flushed angrily. He would not •</seg><seg type="columnLine">receive a gift from Billings. The map-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maker could never understand the boy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature. Nevertheless, he did not bury</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wolf's head in the sand with his other</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn-out garments but left it lying by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. In the morning he saw that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, and judged that Alashan had it about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they were lying down on their saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloths to sleep, Billings turned to the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think Nadesha went with Loo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang of her own will?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silence. Billings felt that he had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">something harmful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alashan, it looks as if the Kirghiz,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whoever they are, were gathe ing around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sonkor. What does that mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was so long before the son of the Khan</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered that Billings lay back and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">settling his shoulders in the sand when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jackal snarled from beyond the hollow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The wild dogs are sitting on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunches," said Alashan in a low voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The jackals have come from afar; the vul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures are in the air."1</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nay, around l^he Horde."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings, as he pictured the road-weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">clans crossing the desert steppe, a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty miles in three days, thought this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than likely,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SONKOR would not have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found by Billings alone for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason that it was hidden from any</seg><seg type="columnLine">searcher who should come over the steppe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alone, the captain might have combed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau for months and seen only the oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casional aul of a shepherd, or the basalt</seg><seg type="columnLine">shafts that might have been tombstones</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of giants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Alashan followed the Kirghiz tracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the nose of a ferret until hostile tribes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, appearing ahead of them on the trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced them to turn aside. Then it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings who used an old trick of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plorers and ascended a height from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground in front of them could be sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veyed as clearly as if drawn on a map.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Jove!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Even Alashan drew in his breath quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The red clay sloped away sharply in front,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently to the edge of a precipice. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond and below this was a great, green</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley topped on the farther side by moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains of immense extent. In the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley they could see a sluggish river</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding, and on the nearer bank of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river a camp of more than a thousand tents,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ranks of camels and horse herds graz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing near the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The Chu," Billings decided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the camp of the Black Kirghiz,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">assented Alashan gravely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They looked for signs of the horsemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had seen along the trail, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders had vanished. It was late afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and darkness would set in before they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick up the tracks again and follow them</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Alashan pointed out the high, black hats</seg><seg type="columnLine">on some of the soldiers in the nearest tents,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stacked arms, and the standards topped</seg><seg type="columnLine">by huge elk antlers. He judged there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least eight thousand of the tribesmen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The distance was too great for Billings to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see these particulars, but it struck him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the number of horses was more than that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True," agreed Alashan after a pause;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"the Kirghiz have been raiding. No Kir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghiz women are in the camp. The horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been lifted from the Baskirs, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the Moslem tribesmen were riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">against us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then it is well we did not follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders down to the Chu," Billings pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. "You wear the garb of a Baskir.",</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alashan seemed indifferent. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">squinting into the distance, trying to read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the answer to the ^ question i as to what</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the power of the Kirghiz so near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steppe. His face was drawn. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aul where they had obtained their dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guise, they had wandered for two days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">being'forced to camp at night in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the trail in view. It had been a test of</seg><seg type="columnLine">endurance, and both were still fit. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had drawn on their reserve strength, Bill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings more than the Tatar, and their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were overbright, their hands restless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are the Kirghiz doing here?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the map-maker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tents seemed to him to be arrayed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of semicircle, facing the height on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Said Alashan, bitterly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The wild dogs are sitting on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunches, waiting; the jackals have come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from afar. The Kirghiz live by raiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from the mountains, but this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater than a raid. They ride to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaying."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hope it's not us," thought Billings..</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am going to look at the edge of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipice," he added aloud. "That sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone rock might be a watch-tower."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had not much fear of being seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from below because numberless masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandstone made the summit of the slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">jagged, as if it were a crenelated battle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Billings climbed from his saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slipped down the slope, holding to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">points of the rocks. He was careful not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dislodge any of the soft fragments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. Coming to the edge, he ducked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, lying on his belly, stared over the brink.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was looking at Sonkor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The precipice was nearly sheer, a wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">cf red and purple stone, beneath which</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood a black temple. It was black from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of its twin towers to the crude wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flat rocks that surrounded its courtyard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its lines were curiously deceptive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The walls slope in markedly, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">do the towers," he thought. "Let me see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, five, seven rows of windows. Arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">slits, rather. Must be seven stories high.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The slope inward must make it look gigan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic from the Chu."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The peculiar black appearance was due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stone used--granite and basalt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently brought, by boat from the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorges of the Chu. (Billings was observing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time some of the devices used</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Tibetan lamas to make their temples</seg><seg type="columnLine">formidable, in looks as well as strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In Lhassa there were monastery halls with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillars of chenars that did not grow within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand miles.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw too that more tents of the Kirghiz</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clustered just outside the courtyard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wall and that the court and the roofs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple were quite deserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Returning to Alashan, he reported what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen. The boy was all for searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a way down the cliff. Billings nodded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but their exhausted horses stood with heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the ground, and legs quivering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Done for," Billings reflected. "Food's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. Sunset--dark in half an hour."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He glanced at Alashan. "Can we enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kirghiz camp? It surrounds the tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple on three sides, and on the other side is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nadesha is there, in the lamasery."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"True. And Loosang is there. Ala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shan, to-night js the sixth of his nine nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the Horde. It is in my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tomorrow he must mount again to ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the northwest. If we are to reach Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">desha before he goes it must be this night."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"True." Alashan gnawed his lip. "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark we can slip through the camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping away from the watch fires. Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lamasery we would find the going</seg><seg type="columnLine">harder. No one is allowed within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple gate except the guests of the lamas,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and they are watched by armed guards-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw no guards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They watch from the embrasures. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sons of the devil are all within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple it means they are preparing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremonial for the night. If so the doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lamasery will be closed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings tethered his horse reflectively</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a dead oak and shrugged. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon had been obscured for three nights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if to make their efforts useless. To get</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the cliff in the dark would be hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. For a pseudo-Baskir and a Cossack</seg><seg type="columnLine">bravo to penetrate into the temple of Bon</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a problem. To find Nadesha and</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak with her under the nose of Loosang</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a miracle--if, indeed, Nadesha</seg><seg type="columnLine">had actually reached Sonkor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Alashan was convinced that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. So far the instinct of the boy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steppe had proved true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you a plan?" Billings asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">son of the Khan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alashan laughed, for the first time since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the map-maker had known him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have no plan, captain. But I feel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way will be opened. Look, there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">vultures in the sky over the camp; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunset is red--the gate in the sky is red.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There will be blood under our feet this night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kai--I know it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Road of the Giants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's a fool of a pagan, and a savage,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought Billings. "But, may the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">pest take me, I can't let him go down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that cesspool of Satan alone. I'll stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">by him until Nadesha is found, or the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets his throat slit; then I'll look after</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A brazen thunder shook their eardrums.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed as if the very clouds overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">had trumpeted down a challenge. Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore and clutched at his sword hilt. Ala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shan glanced up from narrowed eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again came the note of the trumpets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated three times, fainter and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">mellow. An echo came back from' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains across the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By a common impulse the man and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy turned and ran back toward the sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit of the slope leading to the cliff. Look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over the rise cautiously they beheld</seg><seg type="columnLine">four black figures below them on the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cliff. Four bronze -trumpets, longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the tall musicians, w7ere leveled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the horns were lowered over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipice and the three notes repeated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This done, the four lamas turned to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, in single file and disappeared among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nest of rocks that Billings had called a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulpit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings chuckled under his breath. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see thousands of ant-like figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">running out of the Kirghiz tents to stare up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The way is opened," whispered Alashan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There must be a passage down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple from the spot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They crept after the four from boulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">to boulder until they came to a sandstone</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge halved by a wide crack. Alashan</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the print of feet in the dust here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Entering the shadow between the rocks, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">left daylight behind them at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shelving downward, the path turned aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">into what seemed solid rock. But here</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings saw the gleam of a candle far down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ahead of them. Quickening their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace, they hurried on and at the next turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out the trumpeters, in single file,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leader with the candle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The immense horns delayed the progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lamas so that Billings and Alashan</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept up with them easily. The cleft had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to a kind of wide tunnel, twisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and irregular. Only in the steepest de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scents were steps cut into the soft stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Limestone, Billings believed, and judged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that water had cut this channel down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley of the Chu hundreds of years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, when the river was still eating its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to its present course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More than once they passed along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of a lofty cavern, their steps muffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the inch-deep carpet of white, powdered</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. And once they edged warily across</seg><seg type="columnLine">a natural bridge over such a cavern, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing sight of the candle as they did so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air grew much warmer. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to stoop now, to work down a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage. Billings judged that the air, here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heated by the rays of the afternoon sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the cliff outside, and that they must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the entrance. Nor was he wrong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"-" he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He had seen the lama in the lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause at a heavy, wooden door, and knock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The portal swung open. Stooping, the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailed out with their horns. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung shut. Billings and the boy were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in total darkness. Both knew that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not find their way back. True, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had flint and steel and some jbowder, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing in the cavern to ignite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They made their wray down to the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocking their heads more than once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feeling the stout boards cautiously and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing against them, Billings decided the</seg><seg type="columnLine">portal was barred on the outside. Wiping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sweat out of his eyes, he considered. ■</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Alashan," he whispered, "the lamas have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stationed a guard at this end of the passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The men with the horns did not open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door themselves. There was a sentry on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side. Good. We will knock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get ourselves admitted to the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bon before the guard goes elsewhere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did so, rather hastily. It had occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him suddenly that the lama on watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have gone away after the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being posted at the door to let them in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was likely, if anything unusual was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the -wind that evening, that a man would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be stationed to watch the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A step sounded on the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier. Billings knocked again, loudly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he had a right to enter. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars was taken down. Then silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Plainly the man on the other side was</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled. Billings rapped a third time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatiently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand back," he ordered Alashan softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Be ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The other bar came down. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung toward them, concealing them in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">onadow. A shaven head, wrinkled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare as a snake's, was thrust into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A flash, followed by the sound of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking bone. Alashan had brought down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of his sword viciously on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest's pate. The man sprawled forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughing, writhed; and Alashan struck again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time with the edge. Then he caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long, cassocked form and tugged jt</seg><seg type="columnLine">well into the passage. Billings was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tchou, my cousin," Alashan hissed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"would you tie a viper with silk, or play</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an adder in the dark? Besides, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not dead. You do not know these devils.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lifted the head of the guard, pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the lips from the teeth. Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that they were sharpened to points.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He glanced out of the passage. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">else was visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lamp glimmered in a basin of oil beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway. They could make out that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room outside the passage was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">lofty, that its walls were the white limestone</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. In the center of the chamber directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of them was what appeared to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad column of black lacquer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After Alashan had closed the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced the bars, leaving the unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">lama in the passage, they searched the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another exit. A second door stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite the first, and this also was locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings listened at the crack and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a dull murmur some distance away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the camp of the Kirghiz. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked tentatively, but this time there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no response.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop." Alashan caught his arm. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are seen coming from here, it will be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of everything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He pointed up over his head. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the front of the lacquer column</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. The candle, behind it, framed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness a score of arms projecting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A spider," muttered Billings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bon," said Alashan softly, "the De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The entangled arms ended in hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each gripping some weapon or object. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was a child, in swaddling cloths.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snakes and varied beasts kept the child--in</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacquer--company. On the breast of Bon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who squatted on a square pedestal, was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny woman, her legs and arms clutching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the, broad body of the god.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They could see clearly, because a round</seg><seg type="columnLine">window in the rock wall directly in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of Bon admitted the last, ruddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of sunset. The face itself was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buddha, cold and expressionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "PfaghI" grunted Billings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could understand now that the lamas</seg><seg type="columnLine">had availed themselves of a large cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">just inside the cliff wall for a tabernacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the figure of the god. The opening in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff let in light during the day, and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted worshipers from the plain to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of Bon. If illumined from within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect must be striking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as they watched, the last gleams</seg><seg type="columnLine">departed from the glittering crown of Bon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They looked at each other curiously. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">break down the door would be to bring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamasery swarming about them. To re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to the height by way of the tunnel was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There remained the aperture in the cliff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the rock wall was sheer. So the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">intruders sat down and listened to the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds from the camp. They knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time some one .would come into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber of Bon from the temple to relieve</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guard at the tunnel door. Then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might slip out. Looking up once restlessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the map-maker drew in his breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The countenance of the god was shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a soft, green light. It was a reflection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The moon is up," explained Alashan</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Billings chuckled and sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know how we can look from the hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cliff. Help me up this pedestal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Alashan had boosted him up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the footstool of the image, Billings began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to climb the front of the giant god, pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself up by the arms that stuck out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every direction, and the limbs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging woman. Now the highest pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of arms were folded, hands crossed, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the chin of Bon, so that Billings was</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished a perch within a yard of the round</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening. Alashan joined him. The statue</seg><seg type="columnLine">being fashioned of solid wood under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacquer work, they were secure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ceremonial had begun. They looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out directly over the roof of the lamasery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two towers. Billings fancied</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the door from the cavern led out upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Road of the Giants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof itself. The moon was rising some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where to the left, over the valley, but its</seg><seg type="columnLine">half light was eclipsed by the smoking</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare of lines of torches in the courtyard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lamasery. Here the lamas were stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in rows, forming a lane out of the court,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Kirghiz camp, down the slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Chu.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the moon is full, these devils</seg><seg type="columnLine">drag out their idols to the river for all to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see," muttered Alashan. "It is at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time expeditions set out from the land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tsong Khapa. See, the Black Kirghiz</seg><seg type="columnLine">are watching."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already a line of sakyas--neophytes--</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying lighted pastels were moving out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the courtyard. Next was led a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, bearing the state robes of the abbot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sonkor, horsemen in yellow cassocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">with painted spears. Behind a boy carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">a basin of glowing coals were thin Tibetans</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the standards of Sonkor--lon^ poles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped 'around with rags.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A tawdry manner of finery," thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings. "Hulloa!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following the standards and pulled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">other rows of disciples came a cart filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with women wearing lotus flowers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying the blossoms in their hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seated among these women was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure wearing a red khcdat and a cloth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver cap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings glanced at Alashan. The boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had recognized Nadesha in her Persian</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress as she turned her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is Nadesha, the daughter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norbo," he said calmly. "But Loosang I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed the cart bearing small, painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">images of various gods that came after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women had no human occupant. Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected that here was Nadesha's country</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a thousand devils--the land where men</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore the faces of beasts. For the lamas</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying the four trumpets of Sonkor were</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked as usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Nadesha herself was here--apparent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly of her own will--and riding in the cart</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the women attendants of the temple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings wondered if she had left the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of the Horde for this estate. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Alashan, who loved Nadesha fiercely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not believe this. He himself suspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Nadesha was up to one of her games,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trick that bade fair to be her last, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Loosang she tricked and the lama</seg><seg type="columnLine">had her in his power,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Climb down," whispered Alashan curtly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not until he had quit the circle of sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dued light did Billings hear the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening door that had aroused the boy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was too late to gain the ground. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited, poised on the fat belly of Bon, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Destroyer. Three men entered the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Loosang was the leader. The two others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bearded tribesmen, wearing heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">black lambs' wool hats and with girdles</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally stuffed with weapons--good ones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For all their swagger, they eyed the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of Bon sidewise and Billings was</seg><seg type="columnLine">grateful for the deep shadow that covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front of the god.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if puzzled by the absence of the guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loosang inspected the inner door, the can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle, and walked around the image of Bon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, satisfied that no one was to be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rock chamber, he squatted down</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing the tribesmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So long did the chutuktu wait before</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking that one, a red-haired giant, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is that Russian money, you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fox?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the tents of the Horde, Nuralin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They spoke freely, believing themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, and in Tatar, the common speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the steppe. Billings did not understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all, but learned later from Alashan what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed. Afterward Billings decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Loosang had taken pains to stow this</seg><seg type="columnLine">cache away for himself where no one would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hai, it shall be ours, Loosang, my owl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the horses and camels of the Horde--</seg><seg type="columnLine">tens of thousands of them, you say. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">their weapons, bought of the Muscovites,</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured from the Turks; good pieces, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">swear. If you have lied, I'll make you</seg><seg type="columnLine">dine off your cassock."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leered at the lama, blinking. Nura-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin Khan had kissed the jug that night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he began to stroke his unkempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard with a hand on which the very hairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All that is very well my chutuktu.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But you claim half the spoil.

Loosang</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke coldly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other Kirghiz, a stunted man with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinched mouth and evil eyes snarled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have sworn an oath, Loosang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You have pledged your word to lead the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horde to the place where we will wait, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills.

Palpably this</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant of the temple had been playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spy, and--of all places--in the arms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Destroyer. Loosang was not satisfied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a cry one of the Tibetans pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the deep sword-cut across the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wounded man.

Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribesmen edged inside the door in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake of Nuralin, who had sobered rapidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This moment Billings chose to slip out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opening from the passage «and move</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the wall with Alashan.

It led through the refectory of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple, out into the courtyard. Coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from within the temple, they were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They pushed through groups of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamas, went out into the camp and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside among the lines of camels where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no fires.

Nadesha will find out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we will take her with us and steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses from the cordon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came to the wagons standing by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river bank. Most of the women of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple had mingled with the crowd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers and were laughing and singing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the near-by fires where feasting was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on in honor of the festival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nadesha however still sat on the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temple cart, a lotus flower between her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, her dark eyes, rimmed with kohl, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veying the crowd that kept at a respect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful distance. For Loosang, mounted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing his yellow robe of office was beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, a half-dozen armed lamas close behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Around the wagon eddied groups</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tribesmen, thin Turkomans, squat, tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">baned Chatagais, quarrelsomely drunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The vultures are flying together,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered the boy bitterly. "They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not attack the Horde in fair battle. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek a corpse to pick bare with their beaks."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings nudged the youth to silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all-important that they speak with</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadesha before Loosang and the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrew into the lamasery, where no</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribesmen would be welcome. Just then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nuralin Khan swaggered up, having re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered from his scare at the temple. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced close to Nadesha, hands on hips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"By the belly of Bon, here is a wanton to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make glad the eye of a chief. A round face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a bright eye, a form fair and melting."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadesha smiled at him, and the Kirghiz</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought to take her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peace, Nuralin Khan," shrilled Loosang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She is a Tatar who has claimed the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection of the god."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tatar or Persian--all one to me," mum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Billings, seeing his chance, thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alashan back. Pushing the Cossack hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">over one eye and lifting the green neckcloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover his mouth, he lurched forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clapped Nuralin Khan on the back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned heavily against the wagon, his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost upon Nadesha's knee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nuralin Khan looked around, his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a pistol, but seeing only a besotted Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sack he spat and returned to his quarrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the lama. Loosang glanced keenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Billings, but the red-haired chieftain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile Billings kept muttering to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. The girl at first glanced con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptuously at him, then her eyes widened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she leaned forward, apparently to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was going on between the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain Beel-ing," she whispered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alashan is with me," returned Billings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How can you leave the wagon and join</seg><seg type="columnLine">us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can not.

Her mobile face clouded. "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you disobey my word and leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horde?

Now he saw that Nuralin Khan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn back, that the Chatagai was whisper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to Loosang, and that all eyes were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his naked sword. Too wise to try to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cart, Billings coughed and rolled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head stupidly, aping a drunken son of' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steppe.

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did so a figure in a soiled khalat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose turban slipped between the Chatagai</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nuralin Khan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alashan decided matters in his own way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the dagger clutched in his left hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stabbed Loosang, the knife striking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ribs of the lama. A squeal of pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the tall men's teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A flurry in the throng, a general cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage. Alashan leaped to the cart as men</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed at him. He threw the dagger into</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces, caught Nadesha up in both</seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;irms, sprang off the opposite side of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon. Here, in comparative darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no bystanders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the river!" shouted Billings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He parried the stroke the Chatagai</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimed at his head, thrust the man through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throat. Freeing his blade, he slashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide at another face, and jumped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nuralin Khan's pistol blazed; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder blast stung his hand. Billings turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran after Alashan and Nadesha. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy had set Nadesha on her feet, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twain were running swiftly away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torches, between the tents. A lane opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">up ahead of them, and at the end of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed the surface of the Chu.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thudding of feet behind him told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings that pursuit was close. He halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swung about, crouching. A spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistled over his shoulder, and his blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">clashed against the simitar of a Kirghiz.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man staggered from a thrust in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach, and another who followed at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels drew back before the glitter of steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings turned and dashed off, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about for a horse. Instead he saw a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of armed men at the end of the tents, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alashan and Nadesha struggling furiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">against overpowering force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain Billings!" shouted the boy, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice breaking. "Leave us. Ride to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horde--warn my father-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a sharp snap as his sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke. Nadesha was still making play</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her dagger. But Billings saw at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were as good as captives. Indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he changed his course and darted be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween two tents he heard Alashan singing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his death chant defiantly. •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After all, Alashan had taken his own way</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dealing with Loosang. For once luck</seg><seg type="columnLine">favored Billings and he found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">among a nest of felt tents--the quarters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some^noble. Tripping over the ropes, be</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged about, catching glimpses of running</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and turning away from the glare of</seg><seg type="columnLine">torches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In front of him he sighted the river, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense thicket of reeds lining its bank. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">however was the goal toward which his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuers were headed. A group of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were plunging close behind him, but mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily he was in shadow, and they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost the scent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings halted, looked about, and flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself on the ground, crawling under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of a pavilion. Small chance, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, for him on the water, so bright was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon. As he expected the large tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">was vacant, the occupants--if there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been any within just then--having run out</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the noise of the pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a large tent, belonging to a person</seg><seg type="columnLine">of importance, and a 'filigreed, bronze lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung from the top of the pole. Garments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins, weapons were scattered about. Bil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lings tore off his Cossack coat and cap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected the first fur-edged khalat his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched and donned a huge, black lambskin</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat that came down over his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only a moment remained before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamas would begin investigating che tents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings ducked out as he had come, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to walk quickly back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll be harrying the river and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outskirts of the blessed encampment,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reasoned. "It won't do to leave for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly perceiving that his sword was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still bare in his hand, the blade smirched</seg><seg type="columnLine">with blood, he thrust it under the khalat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swaggered on slowly, pausing when</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights went past and avoiding the camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This won't do, either," he reflected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Kirghiz will be looking for a Cossack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sure, but the eyes of those devils of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamas'--I can't chance that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a matter of fact the tribesmen he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed paid no attention to him. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more of Alashan or Nadesha. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumult had quieted down, but he noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the number of torches flickering among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reeds had increased and that armed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted lama? were patrolling every main</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenue of the camp. It would be only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of time before they recognized him</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he remained where he was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heading back to where he and Alashan</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed among the herds, he came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, a mere bed of embers, over which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">caldron smoked with an appetizing odor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several sleepy horse guards were lying about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These Billings joined. One muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Temou chu! Dweff in peace."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ahatoti--brother," responded the map-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maker, dipping his hand into the caldron.'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was aware, all at once, that he was giddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">from hunger. There were still portions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutton in the pot, and of these he ate</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravenously. From time to time Kirghiz</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the horse lines, saddled animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rode off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A very wizard of a giaour is afoot. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must take him," one said in reply to a lazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">question from the men around the fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No doubt he was drowned in the river. _</seg><seg type="columnLine">May the black plague take the lamas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another who sauntered up from the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the temple did not even seek out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, but squatted down to light his pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the embers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have the Tatar buck and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiend of a girl up at the temple," he ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served, yawning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have they been tortured yet?" some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nay; Loosang has sworn that the prince-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling and the woman shall be taken by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamas to our ambush on the Kara-Su, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that their eyes shall see the death of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">clan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon, by now, was low to the west,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Billings judged by the mist over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river and the feel of chill in the air that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night was well advanced. His companions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all but one who smoked and spat into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire at regular intervals, were snoring. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, was dark, except for the towers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sonkor upon which the moon still struck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was time for Billings to move. Lei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely he rose, went to the pile from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen Kirghiz taking saddles, selected</seg><seg type="columnLine">one and moved toward the line of horses,.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the corners of his eyes- he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark bulk that was the wakeful horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard. The man's pipe glowed on tran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quilly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently Billings' stay at the fire had</seg><seg type="columnLine">disarmed any suspicion. Nevertheless he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was uneasy until he had secured what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought-from the piles of gear by the cordon</seg><seg type="columnLine">--saddle bags, with a fair quantity of rice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dates and dried meat. Then he flung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle on a large pony, praying that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice might be a good one, adjusted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">halter and mounted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peace be with you, brother," muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Guiding himself by the loom of the cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his left, he threaded his way through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. Once he passed a patrol coming in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickening his pace, he hastened to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight of the camp before dawn should</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His luck held good that night. A heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist rolled up from the river, and although</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings heard sentries calling more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, he was not stopped. The memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Road of the Giants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the fox-like faces of the lamas made him use</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spurs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With daybreak," he reasoned, "they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will follow any single track out of the camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I could swim my horse across the Chu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike down south toward Tashkent and be</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of their reach in a few hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The river beckoned him to safety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once in the caravan routes to Turkestan he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be on his way back -to Astrakan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was what he had planned--extept</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Alashan and Nadesha were prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Loosang instead of free. On the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, north of him was the Kangar, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in poor shape to cross the desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. True, it would be skirting the east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern edge of it this time, but the country was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange to him and without Alashan he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">' be at a disadvantage. And soon the warrior</seg><seg type="columnLine">monks doubtless would hit upon his track.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alashan and Nadesha were dead, or as</seg><seg type="columnLine">good as dead, he ruminated. Evten if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should carry the word of the ambush to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horde, it would not help them a whit. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact if he reached the Horde he was not at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sure he would be believed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was very tired after the exertions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night. The pleading eyes of Nadesha</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be dismissed from his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was it the girl had said--when two are</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers neither abandons the other?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plague take it!" muttered Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings. He jerked his horse's head to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left and trotted into the gullies that led up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope to the north, toward the Kangar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''We'll have a return match with Loosang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it will be a good one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As if to echo his words, from behind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">below him came the blast of the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">trumpet call of Sonkor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE AMBUSH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The prudent man crosses the river at the ford; the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shrewd merchant when his path leads into the moun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tains turns aside and seeks a valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The foolish one swims his horse across the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spurs from peak to peak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Yet when death comes to the twain, it often happens</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the wise man lies in a grave forgotten in the valley</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">while over his head on the mointain summit stands the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gold-adorned tomb of him who was unwise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--Proverb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FORTUNE, Captain Minard Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fond of saying, was very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a wild horse; it would never wait when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you came after it with a halter.

Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it reached the water his pony died. By his</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculation he was yet a long day's ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Torguts, who, he judged, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving eastward across the Kangar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trail he had been, following north</seg><seg type="columnLine">and east led down through the foot-hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a ford--the river at that season in Spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in flood--and here he fell in with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tajiks fleeing down the stream.

They were, in fact, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest point of a promontory, faced on</seg><seg type="columnLine">three sides by the forest and the hills across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river. All of this ground could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">raked by cannon from the other bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a good ambush, that of Nuralin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"-muttered Billings.

From a servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">who still attended Ubaka, Billings took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope and studied the ant-like figures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Red Camel Tatars. That clan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the river and the men were moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">up slowly into the thickets. Fires were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being lit here and there. Saddles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken from the horses, which were grazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly. Some women were singing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Boys were gathering brush from the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the alders and piling it on the fires.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Below him the herd of cattle had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river bank and were churning the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">into mud. A hot sun blazed down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass--still fresh with the moisture of early</seg><seg type="columnLine">Summer. Crickets kept up a chorus that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dwarfed by the stamping of horses, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creak of leather and the cries of children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norbo, who had been urging the mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatars to charge their muskets and string</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bows, returned and wiped the sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who can stem the course of a torrent?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he grunted.

From the forest across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river came the blast of a great horn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It echoed down the valley like a brazen</seg><seg type="columnLine">gong. Under the screen of the pines a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol barked. A second time, faintly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horn sounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The trumpet of the lamas!" cried Norbo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ai-a--men are in those hills."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All noises had ceased in the Tatar throng.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Children looked up at the sky, expecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound to be repeated.

But Norbo</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his men heard other sounds, drowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">until then by the clamor of people around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Horses neighed over in the hills;</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush crackled faintly here and there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Men are in those hills," repeated Norbo</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestly, nodding his gray poll. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are coming this way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now Bilhngs cou'd see that the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Red Camel clan were gathering into</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups. Other clans who had been about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cross the river held back. The lines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders coming over the steppe were at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">standstill. The bronzed faces of the Tatars</seg><seg type="columnLine">were intent; they seemed to be trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The momentum of the marching Horde</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ceased. No longer did the drivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">back on the steppe cry, "Hoa-hoal"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God for that horn," thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings, wondering how one of the lamas</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Nuralin Khan had been so idiotic as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound a blast before it was time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged that the Kirghiz lines had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed well back in the hills, to allow as</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the clans as possible to cross the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river before the attack was made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He observed that boys were running here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there in the Red Camel gathering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddling horses, and that the women were</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving back toward the river. The men</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Road of the Giants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were fingering muskets and watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of alders into which more than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">scout had plunged at the sound of the shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then from the brush ran a bareheaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, waving his arms. Through the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope Billings saw that his kaftan was torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shreds. A crackle of musket shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke out at the back of the fugitive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crackling spread along the river, grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a splitting roar, and smoke began to float</seg><seg type="columnLine">up over the pines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The outcry of the crows was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be heard. The groups of Red Camel</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were thinner all at once, for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to sit and lie down. Here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there horses reared. A woman carrying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle fell and rolled over, kicking up her</seg><seg type="columnLine">booted feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In'the ford a herdboy slid off the back of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">camel into the water and did not appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Wailing came to Billings' ears, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curse sounded from near by. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part, however, the Tatars, schooled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to misfortune, were silent even under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sting of wounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" cried Norbo, pointing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At intervals on the heights across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river whole trees fell over. The round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black mouths of cannon peered out at them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At once they flashed, one at a time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hidden in dense, white smoke. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">balls thudded into the grass or ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the mounted Tatars. Some raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">great spouts of sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in the valleys, a half-mile away</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the river, the heads of mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns appeared. The patter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muskets continued steadily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few feet beneath Billings a little Tatar</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, her head bound in a clean, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerchief, was standing hugging a doll. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of the household images that every</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatar yurt possesses. Billings saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">child start and look at her plaything</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Red drops showed on the face of the felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">doll. Then the girl began to whimper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All at once she screamed and tried to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">back up the bank. Her feet failed her, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings picked her up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had been shot through the chest, over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart. Knowing that there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could do to save her life, he laid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">child in a hollow in the bank and mechanic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally picked up the doll to put in her lap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She continued to whimper more loudly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but could no longer move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Loosang will pay for that," Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised himself, turning away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he was swinging into the saddle of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing horse he halted, surprized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ubaka Khan was again in the saddle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old Khan had cast off his coat and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare to the waist. His brown body, heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbed as a bear's, was erect as he stood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his short stirrups to see the better. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown taller in the last moments, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance was hard and quick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Khans of the Torguts," his tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice roared out, "ride to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The officers were already doing so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ubaka glanced around and began to swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his naked sword over his head in a flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle of steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is the tugh?

Good, good, you sons of dogs."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norbo threw back his head and bayed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shouting was taken up along the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">that began to fall in at the summit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knoll.

For the Kirghiz had achieved the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">first slaying; they had reddened their</seg><seg type="columnLine">swords in the bodies of the doomed clan of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zebek Dortshi, and Nuralin Khan himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stripped the body of Zebek Dortshi who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once been the hero of the Horde.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the Black Kirghiz, lfke wolves, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">layed to torture briefly the bodies of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">older Tatars, with the children--to violate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the younger women who had been caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Kara-su, or to snarl over booty loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">under their hands. Then they moved for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward into the steppe, and behind them</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the jackals, the nimble tribesmen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kara-bagh, Tajiks, Sarts and robbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">generally who had held off until then to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">which side would win the opening skirmish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By retreating at once into the plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ubaka Khan, if he had been leading Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pean troops, would have thrown his regi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments into disorder, turned soldiers into</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitives and laid his supply train open to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he had no supply train; every man</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried what food there was under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle.

Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles back on the waste of clay what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a disordered mob of men became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering of armed clans, dust-grimed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim, and with weapons ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, they were beyond range of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirghiz cannon and out of the net that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been thrown around the bend in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kara-su.

Billings began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to perceive that the Tatars were not holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ground, nor were they being cut to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces as he feared. The clans fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">separately, drawing the Kirghiz on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Road of the Giants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turning upon them fiercely with arrows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sabers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flintlocks of the Tatars, except those</seg><seg type="columnLine">belonging to the Bear Clan and the veteran</seg><seg type="columnLine">infantry of the Turkish war, were handed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">striplings younger than Alashan and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandfathers whose hands trembled but</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose sight was keen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These held the tops of clay buttes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sides of dried watercourses, taking cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the scrub that covered the breast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kangar. Here and there in the groups</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw young girls with bows. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, sharp knives thrust through their</seg><seg type="columnLine">belts to use on themselves if the Kirghiz</seg><seg type="columnLine">should take them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one paid any attention to him. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a precaution he had discarded his Cossack</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat and coat. He sought for the yurt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loosang until he sighted it standing apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">as usual. There were no disciples in</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence this time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drawing his sword, Billings made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through the curtains. He saw the bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Loosang and on it a tall figure with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turned into an image again, by gad," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered, gazing down into the mask.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can't be too sure, though, on my word!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he thrust his blade into the effigy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes and wool and found that it was, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, not Loosang. The lama had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared. Sheathing his sword, Billings wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered to a height where he could make use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his telescope. He wanted to find Norbo</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Ubaka.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All he could see were countless bands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsemen, visible when they topped some</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise in the plain, and separating into couples</seg><seg type="columnLine">above whom steel flashed in the sun when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came together. Here and there men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sitting on the ground, looking for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world like shrubs. Stricken ^horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stretched in front of him as far as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon. Already clouds of vultures were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering against the blue curtain of the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun scorched the back of his neck, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hot sand under him warmed his blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Billings nodded once or twice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrendered to drowsiness, having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">without sleep for two days ana nights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A HORSE, galloping over him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">&amp;mui awakened Billings. He found he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shivering; a cold breath was</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the surface of the steppe, indicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the middle of the night was passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of the sun, a huge, orange moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone down on the carpet of white sand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">etching sharply the shadows of the bushes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings staggered to his feet and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. The horse had halted in a hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him, where the red glow of a fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed a ring of faces. The wind brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his nostrils the smell of burning flesh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This set every fiber of him to clamoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">for food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reconnoitering the fire cautiously, Bil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lings made out that the men were Tatars--</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Wolf clan, by their belts. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut up the hind quarters of a horse and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">roasting the meat over the embers, hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorching it before they thrust it into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouths and gulped it down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time Billings did not hesitate to fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low their example. He swallowed as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the smoked meat as he could hold down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked for water. One of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed behind him; and Billings followed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse track down a gully, at the end of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shadows was a pool of black water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sand -around the pool was trampled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Billings had to step over the bodies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead. He drank until his thirst was</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied. Judging that dawn was at hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he moved out on the steppe toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest height to have a look at his sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings with the first light. He wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get a horse and to find Norbo. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown in his lot with the Horde, and meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the thing through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would be a dog trick to ride off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field now," he admitted. "Besides, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">show isn't over yet. Hulloa!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chills chased up his back. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been stepping out on the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mound when what seemed to be a dead man</seg><seg type="columnLine">perched against a boulder extended a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gripped his leg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look," said a Tatar's voice, "before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings looked and made out several</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribesmen squatting in a circle. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the ring was a man on his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Norbo, almost under the map-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maker's feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May the way be open before you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norbo," observed he cheerfully; but then</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that the Master of the Herds was--</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded. His chest was wet with a dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid that shone in the moonlight; the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheezed in his throat, so that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not speak. Only his eyes moved toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gently as the maker of maps tried to pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hands of Norbo from his chest, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not force the Tatar's fingers from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound, to examine it. So he sat down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait until Norbo should speak or day</seg><seg type="columnLine">should come. Presently the labored breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wounded man was still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The gate in the sky," cried Norbo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The gate--it is open!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surprized, Billings looked up. Crimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was streaking the sky in the east, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind was freshening. A moment later</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norbo died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had not lived to reach the 111, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">death had brought to his eyes a vision that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had sought during the years of his fife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As if the first streaks of dawn had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal, muskets cracked and the fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">was resumed on the steppe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was impossible to learn how the battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tending. The wind stirred up the dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">devils, and before full light a canopy of sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air obscured the §un, while whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillars reached up into the gray vault of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. Billings wrapped his green neckcloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his nose and mouth. Over his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could hear the constant flapping of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heat grew more oppressive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is certainly Hades," thought Bil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lings, "and if Alashan and Nadesha have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been slain I shall no doubt meet with them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whistling to himself, he began to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way back toward the river, determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find out what had become of his friends.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A horse was sorely needed, yet the poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts he met with riderless, were foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, joining a party of Bear clans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who were engaging a similar number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirghiz, he used his sword with such effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the captain of the Tatars pointed out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh horse, and stopped long enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer Billings' question as to the battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The jackals have left the pack," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly, meaning that the outlaw tribes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted the Kirghiz, so Billings judged that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tatars were more than holding their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced curiously at the Cossack dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the map-maker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the Heavens, good sir, you know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use a sword.

On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep clay slope the momentum of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses could not be checked.

Neither side had pistols or</seg><seg type="columnLine">muskets in use, sq a pause ensued in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings made out the figure of Nuralin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khan, hatless, on the farther bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Stop, dog, skulker, slayer of prisoners--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ubaka Khan had heard from captives of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loosang's act in bringing Alashan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadesha to the river to be killed--" stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and await the ox!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eyes of the old Khan were sunk in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and blood dripped from his mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billings could not understand how the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept going, naked to the waist as he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heat that sapped human strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Followed by lines of Torguts, Ubaka</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged his horse into the river and swam</seg><seg type="columnLine">it across.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nuralin Khan looked about him, saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">followers hanging back at the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickets, and remained where he was. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">flee would be dangerous. If he could cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">down Ubaka it would take the sting out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Torgut attack, and he could then hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line of the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Ubaka trotted toward him, Nuralin</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his red head and cast a lance. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Torgut was watchful and slipped to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side in the saddle, allowing the shaft to</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash past his ribs. The belt of Nuralin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khan was still filled with an assortment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons; for an instant he hesitated which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And now a strange thing happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ubaka's sword was in its scabbard. Seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, the red-headed khan took his time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He drew out a long pistol, cocked it, sighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pulled "the trigger. Ubaka was not ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet away. The onlookers heard the click</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steel striking flint, but there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Road of the Giants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">report. The plunge across the ford had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dampened the priming in the weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly Nuralin Khan dropped the useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">firearm, and his hands darted to knife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword hilt.

But the old Torgut had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">need to see what was to be done. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles behind each shoulder blade stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in cords down to his belt. His head</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank as his shoulders stiffened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billings saw the hands of Nuralin Khan</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenched loose from the weapon hilts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Kirghiz was bent back over the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">crupper of his saddle until his fingers quiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered and his teeth gritted as the wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge cut into the small of his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile he had succeeded in freeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet from the stirrups.

THE RIVER BISECTING THE</seg><seg type="columnLine">MAP IS THE PECOS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now two of the trio returned to White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oaks; and Charley Siringo, the wagon boss,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode on alone into the country where Pat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coghlin ruled lik% an old feudal baron.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the tangle of summits he came down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the warmer low lands where the stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wandering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now and again he paused to read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brands in a bunch or turned aside to seek</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a band which had wandered into some</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot-hill canon. So he came on, stopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">where night found him, making himself at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home with such hosts as gave him shelter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once a fandango held him for two days in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hamlet of Mexican adobes, and once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dallied with a pair of hard-eyed rustlers who</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered him good pickings if he would "throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with them" in their next venture. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not likely that either the dark-skinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaqueros with whom he gossiped while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guitars were strumming, or the cow thieves</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom his lean fitness had intrigued into</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking his alliance, noticed how he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">three questions where he answered one; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he owned a ready camaraderie which dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed all suspicions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time he reached Tularosa he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered much information concerning the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">methods of the Cattle King. Here they</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him of Pat Coghlin's expedition; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the news of that man-hunt aroused any</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement within him after what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned, he showed no sign of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The oP man done struck off toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rio Grande," they said. "Like's not you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">find him over at Las Cruces."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he took the trail across the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sands desert and traveled through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly dunes where savage men had plied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trade of murder from the days of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first Spanish settlements. He passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Organ Mountains and crossed the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaches of the Journado del Muerto, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nature in an ugly mood had slain her</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims with greater wantonness than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">renegades who lurked among the pallid</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills. In Las Cruces he met the Cattle King</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Tularosa returning from a bootless chase</seg><seg type="columnLine">and revealed to him his errand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The balance of the boys," he said, "are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in White Oaks.

Pat Coghlin led the way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest bar, where he downed his drink and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped his coarse lips with the back of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you boys go to cutting my herds now</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the grass comes," he said, "it's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plumb sure to raise-- with 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They talked the matter over, and he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">his promise to butcher no more Panhandle</seg><seg type="columnLine">steers if the warriors of the Canadian would</seg><seg type="columnLine">withhold operations until April.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such transactions were common enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a day when most of the big cowmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought openly from rustlers. If the visitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to you well organized, it was cheaper</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let him recover his property than to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show fight; you charged the salvaged ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals to profit and loss and let it go at that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So Charley Siringo saw no reason to ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the good faith of the big Irishman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rode away from Las Cruces and back</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the White Sands. In Three Rivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stopped overnight at the home ranch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mrs. Nesbeth cooked his supper. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meal he sat talking with her and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband. Billy the Kid's name was spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">more often than that of any man in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexico at the time; so it was natural enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it should be mentioned by the guest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> News traveled slowly then; the Scotch</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple knew nothing of the circumstances</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Law-Bringers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding the outlaw's capture. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Siringo told them how the Kid's downfall</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due to those stolen cattle they looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at each other in meaning silence. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes went to their guest, and the free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">masonry which exists among honest people</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they are in a minority loosened their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongues. They told him of the bargain</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they had overheard in this room a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wagon boss departed for White Oaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next morning. He had traveled for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some hours and was well up in the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains when he learned more concerning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods of the Cattle King of Tularosa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where the trail described a long loop on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flank of snow-clad peak he left it to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short cut. The snow was hard as ice on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steep side-hill. He was watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground closely lest his horse should make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">misstep, when the animal went down in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap, and he heard the flat report of a Win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chester above him. A second shot sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as he was leaving the saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fell over a low shelf of rock and lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">there with his revolver in his hand while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two Mexicans who had been sent to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">him peeped over a clump of brush. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rose and went across the ridge. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that they believed they had got him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He allowed them to depart under that im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression and made his own way back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Oaks, where a letter from the Nes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beths reached him a few days later telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that Pat Coghlin was continuing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">butcher the Panhandle cattle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of these facts Charley Siringo wrote</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Bill Moore, the manager of the L X</seg><seg type="columnLine">outfit, and when the tidings reached Tascosa</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cattlemen of the Canadian held a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference. It was plain to see that so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">this sort of thing continued in New Mexico</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might send forth their fighting men</seg><seg type="columnLine">every Winter; but every Spring would find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fresh crop of rustlers to replace those</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom the warriors had exterminated. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that it wis time to bring the law</seg><seg type="columnLine">west of the,Pecos River.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it came that April saw another horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man riding alone through the wild dominions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Cattle King of Tularosa. On foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">or in the saddle he made a splendid figure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he was well over six feet in height, broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered, straight as a young pine-tree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if you looked into his blue eyes you</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that, once he started for a goal, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to reach it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">f A Kentuckian by birth and a Texan by</seg><seg type="columnLine">right of experience, his name was John W.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poe. During the early seventies when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great bison herds used to roam the Llano</seg><seg type="columnLine">Estacado and the Comanche war-parties</seg><seg type="columnLine">were abroad during every light moon, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffalo-hunters knew him as one to whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was no feat of marksmanship to break a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bull's neck at six hundred yards. In Fort</seg><seg type="columnLine">Griffin's palmy days he impressed his per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonality upon the populace by disarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Oglesby, a noted bad-man from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian Territory, with his bare hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people chose him for town marshal</seg><seg type="columnLine">in '78, and he enhanced his prestige by</seg><seg type="columnLine">many deeds of quiet boldness. One wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, when it looked as if the power of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">statutes was broken in the frontier town, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood alone between a mob which filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main street and his prisoner whom they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to lynch. His eyes were serene with</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith as he told them that, although they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might kill him, the law would still remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to exact justice. Before his calm inflexibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">the armed crowd wavered and melted away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came to Mobeetie on the Canadian in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1880, and the reputation born of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploits followed him. He lived up to it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Panhandle metropolis; and so the cattle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men picked him to carry the law, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he placed so deep a faith, into this country</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the west where men were making mock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a large man he was remarkably un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtrusive; he owned a reticence which</seg><seg type="columnLine">effaced him from others' notice like one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those magic robes in the Arabian Nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose wearers were invisible. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to White Oaks he made the journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">by way of Dodge City and the railroad, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering the lawless young mining town, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, by the back door. Wherefore it hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened that none of Pat Coghlin's henchmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew of his presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were many of these; hardly a week</seg><seg type="columnLine">went by but one of them slipped through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night to meet the Cattle King of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tularosa under a certain big cottonwood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree in front of the ranch house and report</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had seen--or done--out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains or the pallid sand-hills. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of them brought tidings of John W.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the law^oving men who lived beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pecos there were a few who knew some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of his comings and goings. Sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pat Garret met him in more than one quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">conference. The officer in charge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">military post at Fort Stanton talked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. George Nesbeth and his wife told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">their story under the Cattle King's nose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three Rivers. In Las Cruces he showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his data to A. J. Fountain, the lawyer whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had retained to help prosecute Pat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coghlin. These and one or two others</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were in the secret were beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pluck up heart and to hope for a day when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big cattle-thieves would respect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights of property and the outlaws would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take to cover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time the warriors of the Canadian</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gathered the survivors of that stolen</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd from Pat Coghlin's ranges and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving them up the Pecos Valley. Poe had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded up enough facts to convince the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most timid of grand juries of the Cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">King's part in the conspiracy. In fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">days more the hangman would meet Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kid at the gallows steps. That was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">propitious state of affairs on the twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighth day of April, when something hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened which changed all plans and dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">high hopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT morning Sheriff Pat Garret</seg><seg type="columnLine">left Lincoln to confer with John W.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poe in White Oaks regarding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case against Pat Coghlin. Before he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted from the county seat he went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-story adobe building which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murphy &amp; Dolan's store during the Lincoln</seg><seg type="columnLine">County war days and was now being used</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the court-house. He entered the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the upper floor, where Billy the Kid was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying with irons on his wrists and ankles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and two jailors watching him. The prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up, and if the nearness of that day</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he would meet the hangman was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind he did not show it; his smile was</seg><seg type="columnLine">care-free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Pat," said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff regarded him from beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooping eyelids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Howdy, Kid," he answered in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitual undertone; then, turning to Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ollinger who was on guard:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bob, I'm going over to White Oaks," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced, "and while I'm away--" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a little gesture to include J. W. Bell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other jailor who happened to be in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room at the time-- "I want you boys to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep just twice as close.a watch as you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob Ollinger laughed grimly. Ever since</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the early days of the Lincoln County war he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the desperado had been bitter enemies;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was one of those blood-born feuds which</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood alone can wipe out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry, Pat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose as he was speaking and went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a closet at the other end of the room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlocked the door and turned to face them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with adouble-barreled shotgun in his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were fixed on the prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's eighteen buckshot in each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these barrels, and I reckon the man that</seg><seg type="columnLine">catches them will know it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He patted the weapon, and when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">replacing it the outlaw called his name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bob, better be careful or you might get</seg><seg type="columnLine">those buckshot yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was smiling as he said it. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar quality in that smile of his, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boyish ingenuousness which disarmed sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picion. But Pat Garret's lids drooped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little lower and his lips clamped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">tighter, so that they barely let his words</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remember, boys. Twice as careful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded at the prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with that he left them to make his</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey to White Oaks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guards settled down to the day's</seg><seg type="columnLine">monotonous routine Which the sheriff's</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit had interrupted. Bob Ollinger re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed his seat facing the cot where his</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge lay shackled hand and foot. A good</seg><seg type="columnLine">three yards of floor space separated them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had he been endowed with a keen sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ridiculous the length of that interval</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have struck him as absurd under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances. But he was not a humorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, nor was he at all imaginative. He sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in silence, regarding Billy the Kid like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bulldog who has been set to watch a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several cowboys who were awaiting trial</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a shooting scrape were playing cards out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hallway at the head of the stairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Occasionally an oath or a burst of laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the group to break the room's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stillness. Ollinger remained immobile in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his armchair. The lank-haired youth stole</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glance at him now and then from the cot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his lips curved, showing his big buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. It was as if the sight of his jailer</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused pleasant speculations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the day passed and at five o'clock in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon Bell appeared to take his turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">on watch. Ollinger gave up his armchair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and called to the cowboys.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Law-Bringers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, boys; supper-time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They followed him down the stairs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the street to a little-Mexican eating-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, jesting after the manner of their care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">free breed. He laughed with them and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered their badinage with good-natured</seg><seg type="columnLine">profanity. Restraint had passed from him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he left that upper floor room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell sat in the armchair watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-haired boy with irons on his limbs, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled so easily. In the room's dimness the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face on the cot showed sharp and white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In part that lean pallor came from the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">confinement; but starvation had heightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. During the past few weeks Billy the Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">had eaten next to nothing. Men thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was because he had the hangman on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a Las Cruces paper came to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day," he said at length. "I wisht you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave me read it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell caught the smile which accompanied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the request, and his own lips relaxed a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he rose to get the weekly where the cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys had left it. When he returned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner made no effort to reach for it; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were beneath the bedclothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of them punchers was saying some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about a shooting down Three Rivers</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Find that item for me, will you? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't make out to turn the pages with these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-hobbles on me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big teeth were revealed by another</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those boyish smiles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> . Bell hitched his chair a little closer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had unfolded the paper so that its</seg><seg type="columnLine">outspread pages formed a screen between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, Billy the Kid performed a maneuver '</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had been practising ever since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had starved himself to sufficient leanness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">If there was any clink of metal the bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes muffled it. The good-natured</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy was scanning the closely printed</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns for that imaginary item when</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sound or other reached his ears, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he glanced up over the paper's top to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outlaw's eyes looking down into his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than a foot away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell reached toward his revolver. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the movement was fairly begun the pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner's hand, now freed from its manacle^,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grasped the weapon and plucked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chair went over with a crash. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputy made one futile step toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperado ;f then turned to flee. Billy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid lowered the barrel of the six-shooter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with a deliberation which allowed the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the door before he pulled the trig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger. The air within the close walls shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the explosion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bell staggered out through the doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell headlong down the stairs. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead when he reached the bottom. Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Geiss, the regular jailer, was sitting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowest step when the body struck him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran into the street shouting the alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When the party in the little eating-house</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the shot Bob Ollinger sprang to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and rushed out. He saw the jailer com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward him and heard his shout. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran on across the roadway. Then a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">high voice above his head halted him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hello, Bob," the voice said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came from a window on the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor oithe adobe court-house, which opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a little balcony. Bob Ollinger looked up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sash was thrown wide. He saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">double-barreled shotgun which had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject of their grim repartee that same</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, slanting down toward him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the gleaming barrels, pressed close</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the stock, he saw Billy the Kid's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. The cowboys who were watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the eating-house door said afterward</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the outlaw was smiling when he pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">■the trigger. The weapon roared and Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ollinger pitched forward, dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took Billy the Kid two hours to file</seg><seg type="columnLine">his leg shackles, for he went at the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">very deliberately there on the little balcony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the time he had come forth from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room where he had been lying a prisoner all</seg><seg type="columnLine">these weeks, more than a score of well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed men were gathered in a tight pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the street. None of them raised a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to stop him. Two cartridge-belts</seg><seg type="columnLine">swathed his body, and two six-shooters</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangled by his hips; he kept a Winchester</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But these weapons, which he had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the closet with the shotgun, were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only menace which was working on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd to keep its members acquiescent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The memory of the Lincoln County war</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which the desperado had been the leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the losing faction was still fresh here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where some of its hardest battles had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought. Many of the audience were openly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sympathy with him. It would need a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bold man to raise his voice against proceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and a bolder one to lift a hostile hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So when he had released his limbs, a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried at his bidding to saddle up a pony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They all stood by while he mounted and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his bidding, there were some who cheered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he rode away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those were hard days. It is a fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the news of his escape reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of Canadian warriors who were driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the recovered cattle up the Pecos, Frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clifford let out a whoop and jumped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river for sheer joy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN 'WHITE OAKS on the day after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jail-break Pat Garret was talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">with John W. Poe over the evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the latter had gathered against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cattle King of Tularosa when a messenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode up and told them the news. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men stood silent until the rider had finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bloody story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll saddle up and strike out for Lincoln,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pat Garret said in his habitual undertone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poe nodded. They parted without more</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. It was no time for talk; and if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been, then gifts did not run in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff returned to the county seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take up the outlaw's trail and follow it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the flanks of El Capitan Peak. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">it vanished so completely that the Apache</seg><seg type="columnLine">trackers whom he got from the Mescallero</seg><seg type="columnLine">agency were unable to find any trace of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was, as has been said, a hard era; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were many men in New Mexico who</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathized with the fugitive. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them genuinely believed that the big cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, who had openly allied themselves with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustlers and professional gunfighters, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only real culprits; some liked the des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perado because they were themselves of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawless breed; and there were others who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were profiting directly or indirectly by</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle-stealing. The posses which Pat Gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ret led forth from Lincoln traveled through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a land where every other man was either</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostile to the law or afraid to give its officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word of information.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So May went by, and June; and Billy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid was still at large. Men spoke his name</seg><seg type="columnLine">in undertones and looked over their shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders when they uttered it; as for the law,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they laughed when it was mentioned. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">said there was no law beyond the Pecos.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the mean time John W. Poe kept on</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his business of getting evidence-</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the Cattle King of Tularosa. If he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was disheartened by the turn of events he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not allow it to interfere with his work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when he came back to White Oaks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one day early in July the witnesses were</seg><seg type="columnLine">listed; the warrants were sworn out; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case was complete down to the last little</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was walking down the mining town's</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded street that afternoon when an old-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timer by the name of George Graham, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had known back in the buffalo-hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">days at Fort Griffin, fell in beside him--one</seg><seg type="columnLine">ox those ardent spirits whom whisky and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faro have bested in many an encounter but</seg><seg type="columnLine">who are always willing to renew the strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle. On this day, however, he was cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">sober.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on," he said as quietly as if their</seg><seg type="columnLine">last meeting had been yesterday instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago. "I want to talk to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led the way around the corner and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out along the side street to the fringes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town ; nor did he stop until they had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last cabin and were in the thick brush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," Graham announced when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about to make certain that no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was near by, "I know your business in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, and I got something to tell you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lowered his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The other night, not having room</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, I was sleeping in Dedrich Brothers'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Livery Stable. They used to be in business</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Kid, those fellows, rustling cattle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years or so ago. Well, I'd made down</seg><seg type="columnLine">my bed and was lying there in the hay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I heard three of 'em talking in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. The's just a thin board partition and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words come plain where I was rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in my blankets. They was speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Kid. He's been near White Oaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">twicet lately; sneaked in to see them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">some deal or other. And right now he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">holed up at Fort Sumner. I thought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">information might-come in handy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They parted there in the brush and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to town by separate ways, and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next day John W. Poe journeyed to Lincoln.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know the man," he said when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated the news to Pat Garret, "and lie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight. If it wasn't for that I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come, for it doesn't so 11114! possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a chance in a thousand," he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared ; "but if you say so, I'll go. We'll pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">up my deputy, Kip McKinney, over in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roswell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They rode down from Lincoln to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley of the Pecos and talked it over with</seg><seg type="columnLine">McKinney in the hamlet where Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">J. C. Lea had recently platted the site of</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Law-Bringers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the town which has since grown to one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most'prosperous in the Southwest. Like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other two, the deputy was a former Texan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And like them he took small stock in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">information. He and Pat Garret had</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouted over the country of the upper Pecos</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than once that Summer and they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">got no trace whatever of their man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never find him there," he asserted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's down in Mexico. That's where he is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the three set forth with no faith in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tidings which had led them on the errand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But though they thought it was a wild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">goose chase they took the precaution of</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding out from Roswell in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the county seat. For if that one chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a thousand should turn out to have fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their favor, they did not propose to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">their purpose be known in a country where</seg><seg type="columnLine">scores of riders were ready to risk their lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry warning to the outlaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they had traveled for some miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the hills they turned from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lincoln road and struck off to the north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward toward the abandoned military post.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They avoided the beaten trails; they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">detours past every ranch house and sheep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. They rode hard--keeping the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them, as the saying of those old</seg><seg type="columnLine">days has it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was more like the ride of three fugitives</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeing from justice than three of the law's</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Night came. They picketed their ponies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rolled up on the bare ground in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle blankets. The next day they pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, and when darkness fell it found them</seg><seg type="columnLine">encamped in the sand-hills six miles or so</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of Fort Sumner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the morning they held a conference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pat Garret had courted his wife in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlement at the abandoned post; and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a Mexican in that part of the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try but knew him since last Winter, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and the warriors of the Canadian</seg><seg type="columnLine">had captured Billy the Kid a few miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And me," said Kip McKinney, "why</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've been there half a dozen times. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to show my nose they'd, all know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was up before I'd got off my pony."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it fell to John W. Poe to ride into</seg><seg type="columnLine">town and find out what he could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you get there," Pat Garret told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, "go to Beaver Smith's store. 'Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody hangs out there. If you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">find anything you might go on to Rudolph's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seven miles out on the Las Vegas road. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friend of mine. Good man. I'll give you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a note to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you ain't back here by dusk, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a double row of cottonwoods runs</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for two miles from the post at the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of town. We'll ride over and meet you</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the far end of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Poe rode up to old Beaver Smith's</seg><seg type="columnLine">store that morning there was no one in sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">save the grizzled proprietor, who was loung-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the doorway, and a couple of Mexi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans who were devoting themselves assidu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously to doing nothing at all. By the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had dismounted and thrown his pony's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reins over the hitching-rack three or four</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men had appeared from nowhere in</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Howdy," said Beaver Smith; never was</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting more noncommittal; he looked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newcomer over from head to foot and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">let his eyes stray down the little street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were now half a dozen inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their way to the store. Fort Sumner</seg><seg type="columnLine">was waking up. Beaver Smith's eyes came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Poe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where you from?" he queried sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "White Oaks," Poe had the answer ready.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Been prospecting. I'm on my way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canadian."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dallied at the door while the town's</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcoming delegation strayed up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered around him. They were hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens; one did not need to look at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolvers--and every man of them wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon beside his thigh--to realize that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They nodded to him, and when they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">appraised him narrowly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Which way you coming from?" one</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "White Oaks," he said. "Been pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And where you heading fer?" another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told the story that he had given Beaver</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How's the mines panning out?" the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioner cut in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave them the latest news from Baxter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountain. It seemed to satisfy.them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come inside and have something," they</seg><seg type="columnLine">bade him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood among them before the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpainted bar and drank sparingly of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fervent whisky, the while he retailed such</seg><seg type="columnLine">tidings from the lower country as were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest. And when the talk had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">7 6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a little looser he turned the subject in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of his quest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pat Garret was over in White Oaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I left," he told them, "after the Kid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They say he's been down that way lately."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The talk died at once. He found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of a dumb group. Beaver Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffled back and forth sorting out glasses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no other sound. Poe felt their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes searching him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have another," he said and waited while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tension passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More men came in and watched him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they drank.' The conversation picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. They talked of mines and of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospects for feed and other kindred sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects. And when something like an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone by he casually mentioned the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">law's name once more. No one replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He caught some of them looking sidelong at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another; but most were watching him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no mistaking the suspicion</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had come among them. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">hfc began to feel that there was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the information which George Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He loafed about the store for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour or so and when the constraint had lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">he departed for an eating-house, where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got his first real meal since leaving Roswell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he swung into the saddle and rode out</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the road which led off toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canadian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He traveled for some miles; for he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonably certain that if one of those hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed men with whom he had been drinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Beaver Smith's that morning discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him taking a different route from the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his story had indicated he might be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a target for the man whom he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking. When he had gone far enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfy the most exacting of spies, he started</seg><seg type="columnLine">across country for the Las Vegas road and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his way to the Rudolph place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was well along in the afternoon when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dismounted at the ranch house. Ru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dolph met him at the hitching-rack; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an elderly man and well to do, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few in the country who were above sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picion of Qjliance with the outlaw. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of the morning's ordeal in Fort</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sumner made Poe go slowly now. He sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wide porch with his host, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked of many things before he mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy the Kid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've heard," Poe said, "that he's in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country around Fort Sumner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was as if he had thrust a revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle into the man's face. Rudolph turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shade paler. His eyes became furtive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a show of it," he declared vehe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mently. "He ain't here and ain't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">here." /'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poe showed him Pat Garret's note then</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when the other had read it, put his cards</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pat Garret's wrong and you're wrong,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rudolph told him. "There's nothing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. Nothing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The very emphasis which he put upon it</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the statement sound the more im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable, and he was in a sweat of fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor did he draw a free breath until his</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitor rose to depart. Then hisjrelief was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so patent that Poe rode away more con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced than ever that the outlaw was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where close by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 cfc I IT WAS now evening; too late for</seg><seg type="columnLine">I / I kTM to return to the camping-place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      He struck out for the two rows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottonwood-trees which Pat Garret had</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned when he left; and as he was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up over a low sand hill to the west he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the sheriff and Kip McKinney riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him from the east. They met as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been timed by clockwork.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poe recounted the day's events. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had finished Garret shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're on a cold trail," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the feeling born of what he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heard in Fort Sumner kept Poe stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">born, and although Kip McKinney like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff argued that there was no use in going</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther, he persisted. At last:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know a house," Garret said, "where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kid used to visit. There's a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives there he's took a fancy to. If he's in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fort Sumner he'll mighty likely be at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">house."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They rode down the old abandoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenue of cottonwoods and left their horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the other end. In pre-war days the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government had a Navaho school here, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indians had planted a peach orchard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The trio stole on foot through the straggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees v/hich had survived the years to a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they could watch the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon rose.

The son of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lucien Maxwell, who gained fame in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of the Santa Fe Trail, he had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down here after the abandonment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">military post, to become known as one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the biggest sheep men in the territory. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Garret were close friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If the Kid's been around Fort Sumner,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poe persisted, "he'll have heard of it. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">may as well cover all the ground as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're here." ''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So as a last resort and more because they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not like to leave without doing every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that could be done, than for any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, they went to Pete Maxwell's house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the old days of the military post it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been officers' quarters, a large two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">story adobe fronting the open space which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once been a parade ground. A paling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence surrounded it. There was a wide ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">randa on all sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It stood silent in the moonlight as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men slipped up toward it. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had passed through the gate, Garret</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the nearest door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's Pete's room," he told them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll go in and have a talk with him. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows wait out here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the Mexican fashion the rooms all</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened on the veranda. The door to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff had pointed was the first one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the front; it was ajar for the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">was warm. Garret entered without knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; his tall form was swallowed by the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poe leaned against the paling fence. Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kinney dropped on one knee, tucking that</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot under him, cowboy fashion, and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to roll a cigaret. Both had laid aside their</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winchesters. They felt able to relax a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigilance which had kept their hands on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their weapons ever since the beginning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening. Pete Maxwell's place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">above suspicion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And because of that fact the man whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were hunting had chosen Pete Max-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">well's place for his refuge during all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks while posses had been scouring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, while the sheriff slipped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened room and the other two took</seg><seg type="columnLine">their places by the fence to wait, Billy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid lay on his blankets in a little adobe</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin in the rear of the house listening to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mexican who had passed the trio in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Navaho peach orchard. Those whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered tidings of strangers in Fort Sumner</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused him from sleep to catlike quickness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he harkened he was drawing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his clothes; he buckled his belt, slipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver in its holster, picked up his Win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chester and hurried out unshod, to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the strangers. Maxwell could tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He came straight to the sheepman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John W. Poe looked up and saw him ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching in the moonlight, a slight figure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent forward with haste, almost running.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not dream it was the outlaw, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had never seen. One would as soon ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect to meet Billy the Kid in Lincoln as in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete Maxwell's yard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shadow of the house fell on the pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the fence. Billy the Kid almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled on Kip McKinney, who was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">finishing rolling his cigaret, before he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. His rifle was in his right hand; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore his six-shooter--it was a double-</seg><seg type="columnLine">action forty-one Colt's--waist high on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left side, a trick of his own and--like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun--unique among the warriors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">border. The left hand moved. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon's muzzle almost touched Poe's</seg><seg type="columnLine">belly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quien es?" In English it is, "Who are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In after years Poe said that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickest draw he ever saw. And the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was vibrant with suspicion. And still Poe did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not dream whose voice it was. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--from the time when he first caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the coatless, unshod figure until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revolver was confronting him--had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasted perhaps two seconds. Men drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">their guns too often in those days for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attach any suspicion to that action.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And this was the one place in Fort Sumner</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Sheriff Pat Garret was welcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all right now," Poe said quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No one's going to hurt you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had a dim idea it might be one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete Maxwell's sheep-herders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Billy the Kid backed away without</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling the trigger. In all his career--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially since the close of the Lincoln</seg><seg type="columnLine">County war when he had become an out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">law--he had been overquick with his trig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger-finger. Shoot first and ask questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward, was the rule in that country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had always gone the rule one better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But tonight he forsook his deadly cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom. Probably it was for the same reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that which kept Poe from suspecting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">identity--this was Pete Maxwell's place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could not well afford to kill a man here</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he was sure that his victim was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he backed away and as he retreated</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the veranda--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quien es?" he asked again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He repeated the question sharply as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the room. The last that Poe saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him was when he stood his rifle on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threshold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pat Garret was sitting on Pete Maxwell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed. The room was black dark. The figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the outlaw flashed past the pool of moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light at the door and was swallowed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom. It reached the foot of the bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pete, who are those fellows?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the desperado asked the question Pat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garret's hand dropped to his revolver-butt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew the voice. He started to pull the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, and it stuck. It was--so he told John</seg><seg type="columnLine">W. Poe afterward--a long and lonely mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy the Kid heard the movement and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled away from the bed toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room's outer wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Quien es?" he demanded.	\</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had shifted his revolver to his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand; he had drawn a butcher-knife in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left when Garret's weapon came free, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff fired twice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside the house Poe and McKinney</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the two shots and the thump of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaw's body as it struck the floor.

Poe was astounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Couldn't be," he cried. "You've got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong man, Pat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garret shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'd know that voice in a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he was speaking Pete Maxwell burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth upon them.

This be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to a dead and frightful Melanesian</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose long empty belly had bloated hide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously and whose filed teeth, stained with</seg><seg type="columnLine">betel and tobacco, grinned between drawn-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back, shriveled lips. The body, stark naked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled in the bows on its back. Another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">face downward, was amidships, jack-knived</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a thwart, a dingy cloth, about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loins, fluttering in the breeze. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">four oars close to these two, there was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other at the stern, dragging idle in the sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured by marlin to the stem of the steering</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowlock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There a man sat hunched, half-clad in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirty white drill trousers and cotton sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let. His head drooped low on his chest, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">black tangle of beard fanned over his knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">riffled in the wind. His feet were bare and</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed and broken as were his wrists and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. The skin had burned as dark as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the natives. Hatless, his untrimmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair was backblown in long wisps that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed the features of a tortured face that</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like nothing so much as the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a rapacious bird, dead and dessicating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the boat was no semblance of food or</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. A rusted lard-can seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been used as bailer. The headstaves of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small keg were gaping. To port and star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, equidistant, four fathoms astern, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangular dorsals of two sharks moved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">unvarying position, sea-jackals, waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea or wind to fling them their fill. Above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beady eyes of the frigate birds gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. A little while ago they had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of life in the figure in the stern. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still a man, not a corpse. Now--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not quite sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wasting of the white man's tissues</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphasized the bigness of his skeleton. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders were broad, the shoulder-blades</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected to throw wide shadows, the hoop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ribs proclaimed enormous lung power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the cordy muscles, unsheathed by flesh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking like underlays of old rope beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skin, told of a once-powerful body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oahu shifted in color, discovering form.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maui changed from a great hump of azure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deep-seamed, solid lava, canefields rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its scoriaceous sides like an emerald tide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molokai disclosed sheer cliffs with the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reefed sea chafing in white floss of foam at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their buttresses. The boat sloshed on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gait of a hopeless sea-tramp, the crisp</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves slap-slapping at it, contemptuously</seg><seg type="columnLine">testing every seam, tilting it experimentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shuttle of the current that bucked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sharp fins moved up closer.

She was due</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Honolulu at seven o'clock and she was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour and a half late.

He left his will</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsummoned; he refused to listen to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of his conscience; he neglected his</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant practice of prayer. Against this</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion of hatred fought that of love,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused by the contemplation of Avis' pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, wrestling it to a deadlock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For himself he might have fled, started</seg><seg type="columnLine">afresh, after buying freedom from Watson</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any cost.

For</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> her he would have cheerfully flung over</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope of heaven and gone down to hell with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this devil after he had choked from him</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and power of vileness. But--he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied and delivered; there was no way open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murder? It would out. His wife would</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for him in vain even if, by some miracle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he avoided discovery. In three days Avis</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be returning home to make the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparations for her wedding, at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coyle glimpsed the mocking presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watson. That was at first. A darker</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow had fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watson had hinted of settling down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Honolulu. The slimy octopus had dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think of twining tentacles about the fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance of Avis. Hints only, put when Lao</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chu was absent, devilish insinuations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">innuendos that left one dread certainty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, however far he might ultimately dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go, Watson's resolution was set to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">off Avis' engagement. That Coyle should</seg><seg type="columnLine">do so, under threat of exposure. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come pressure upon the girl to favor</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father's old time friend and benefactor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On his knees by his bed Coyle sank his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nails deep into his palms, symbol of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony of his spirit. His face had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">haggard, his hair grayer, the lines about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth deeply bitten. He had no sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His affairs were neglected. The Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">maids had been sent on vacation, Lao Chu</seg><seg type="columnLine">vouched for the Chinese boys. Yet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house could not hope to hide its secrets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The purchase of liquor must bring about</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisperings, the lights late in the night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sounds of drunken revelry, must loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumor and scandal concerning the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">now denied himself to all, pleaded sickness</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the dereliction of church duties and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">denied himself to all visitors. The Wal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">singhams had been reserved about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">match between their son and Avis Coyle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been plain that the parents, of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">New England stock, would have preferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">the father of their daughter-in-law to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who could speak more frankly, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly of his own connections.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to have lost the faculty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayer. He was numb of soul. And he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk deeply with Watson; the only way--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a show of aptitude for the captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasures, his reminiscences of the old, wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">life--that he had been able to keep the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the house. Wine and song were be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning to pall; the lechery of the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature demanded satisfaction for all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lusts. He proposed to introduce vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">women into the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And all Coyle could say, seeking light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was,"God! God! God!" No more, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dumb petition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day passed, and the next. Over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over in the back of his mind, as may a</seg><seg type="columnLine">malefactor in the death cell, Coyle toiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the weary treadmill of his fate, seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eleventh hour of escape. The new</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength within him fought against the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent impulses. Lao Chu, silent, impas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive, automatic, had begun to regard him</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely, he fancied, thinking perhaps that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coyle was backsliding to the old way. Were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ways for which Lao Chu himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretly pined? The ways of the Oriental</seg><seg type="columnLine">were inscrutable, even after all the years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the night before Avis, happy Avis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to return home. Lao Chu had the bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ibr the crotons prepared, the plants had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been removed, dipped in soft mud, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunset. They would be in place by sunrise</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next morning. Lao Chu would keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">his "plomise" though the heavens fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watson had staggered off to bed. "For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beauty sleep," he announced with a leer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coyle sat at the littered table a gaunt, stony</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of despair, slowly gathering resolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. When Lao came to remove the mess</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bottles, glasses, ash, Coyle waved him</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, sitting on alone far into the night. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt God had forsaken him, for he had cursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">God in word and deed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, in his room, he kneeled by the bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much from weariness as anything, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one vague, despairing hope that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet be shown a way other than the one he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had determined upon. But the posture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">petition found prayer wanting. Aforetime</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had felt ecstasy, the dynamic thrill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">connection with the All Powerful Source.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tonight the connection was wanting. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only an old man, condemned to worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">than death, tormented in a living hell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Lao Chu found him, bringing him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooling drink. Coyle took the chilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbler gratefully for his throat seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with cinders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I clush flesh tamalind, flesh lime. Velly</seg><seg type="columnLine">nice." Coyle sipped at it, set it down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching at Lao's afm, speaking in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse, strange voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to kill him, Lao. It's the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wha' fo'? No. You Klistian, no can</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill. Suppose you kill, you hang. Much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> betteh he hang. You wait along tomollow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now you dlink, you lie down, tly to sleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I put out the light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, for God's sake, no! I can't stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he lay down and the old Chinaman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been cook aboard the Good Start</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothed him as if he had been a feverish</seg><seg type="columnLine">child. When he saw Coyle's body relax and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes close he stood at the door before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shut and locked it from the outside, slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping the key into his sleeve, sure that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soporific he had administered would last</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN HIS own room Lao Chu looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly about him. He went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window and saw the lights burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of drawn curtains in the boys' quarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they were playing fan tan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were two shrines in the room. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his heathen deity, before which he lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">punk sticks. The other a picture of Avis</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coyle, exquisitely framed in carved sandal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood, signed "To my friend Lao Chu."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before that stood a tiny oxblood vase of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ming, in it a spray of frangipani, two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, velvety blooms sending out fragrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">the punks could not dilute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a smile on the yellow face as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked at the photograph, the same smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which he had surveyed the sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coyle. It sobered as he turned to the joss,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, kneeling, touched his forehead to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor in devout obeisance. Perhaps he wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiped. Without doubt he found in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiration. When, after a long interval, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to his feet his face was placid with</seg><seg type="columnLine">content.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened a chest of teak, reenforced with</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, cunningly locked. He sought at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of a heap of miscellany and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a small lacquered box. In it was a ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dark brown substance, the size of a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble, greasy looking, slightly elastic, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembling guttapercha, with an odor of wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and musty cloths. This he rolled out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of a bureau, examining it with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost care. It was the witch-ball of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tahunga, a tindalo wizard, taken from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted hut on Savo Island in the Solomons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after head-hunters had raided it. As Lao</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously squeezed it a sharp sliver of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like bone, a tiny fang, protruded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lao Chu descended to the kitchen. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pantry was a young white cock in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crate, brought in from the yard earlier in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crotons</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening. It blinked at the light Lao</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched on, then began to peck at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">grain. He opened the crate and dexter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously seized it by legs and saddle, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">tucked it under his arm, stroking the gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hackles, parting them. He pressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warlock's weapon against the flesh. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly the cock's neck fell limp, its eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, its beak half opening, remaining in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that position. No other change appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scarlet comb retained its color. Watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it carefully, he presently lifted a lid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The eye with its black pupil and reddish</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown iris was still bright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Satisfied, he locked the dead bird aw'ay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a cupboard with a key from his executive</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch and went silently up through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house to the door of Watson's room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it to be locked, probably secured in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other manner. He knew the jalousie</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutters opening on the upper lanai would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be fast. He knew that Watson slept with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun under his mattress, close at hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A houseboy had seen its imprint. Lao Chu</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never entered the room since Watson</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied it but he knew all these things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watson tasted nothing that was not first</seg><seg type="columnLine">sampled by his involuntary host, he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cigars. He was never too drunk for</seg><seg type="columnLine">precautions. If he did not intend to injure</seg><seg type="columnLine">too soon the goose that laid golden eggs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took equal care against his own possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">injury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lao Chu listened to the stertorous snoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the citadel. Then he began to tap</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the door with a peculiar, variant rhythm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It got through to even Watson's alcohol</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulled consciousness after a while. The cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of the Arabella had traveled in savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands in constant danger and his outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentinels were attuned to react swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly he was as wide awake as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-sobriety permitted. Lao heard the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moval of a chair braced under the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle, then the click of the lock. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened swiftly, the room dark. Lao had</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched the landing light and he stood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain view. Watson, clad in his host's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pajamas, too small for his chest, unfastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, showing shags of black hair, thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pistol forward. Lao stood unblinking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands folded in his sleeves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter, you yellow devil?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I like speak along of you. Velly special.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Velly plivate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watson hesitated, frowned, brushed some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep from his eyes with the back of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, found the switch by the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Velly plivate,' eh!

Go tonight. No come back."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watson looked at him quizzically. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to find a certain humor in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You got a stake tucked away, Chu-Chu?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And you want to buy me out?

For a moment he let</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watson look fairly into his eyes. Save for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their slight slant, there was little difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them and Watson's. All were</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, and behind the black pupils some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing seemed to leap and peer in murky</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame. But Lao's voice was silky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you go, all same," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watson's face was beginning to purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with congested blood manifested in little</seg><seg type="columnLine">networks of broken veins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You get out of here, Chu-Chu, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're all in one piece.

It seemed as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not trying to avoid it. As Watson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands cruelly gripped him, compressing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-pipe, the long fingers of Lao's right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, looking as if they were carved from</seg><seg type="columnLine">ivory, clung for a brief moment against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper's hairy chest. Then they closed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if spasmodically, squeezing the poison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watson never felt the prick.

Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">padded down to the ground floor, went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the back offices and crossed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the houseboys gambled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     PERHAPS Lao Chu had not taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">into calculation, together with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">opiate, the exhausted general con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition of Coyle.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. "Of course, if you are afraid it</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't clean business or something of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort, Etaji can take his oil to Siluko."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it ain't that," Jardine declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily. "I was just wonderin', that's all."</seg><seg type="columnLine">At this point, Margaret explained to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">father who Charteris was, what he did, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather, did not do, and where he was resi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent at that time. Jardine eyed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after that, in a more subdued frame of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind than ever. Nevertheless, after he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had asked him again to have a drink, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">been again refused, Jardine ordered one for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and, at the same time, became</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsessed with a brilliant idea which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Gray Charteris</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">109</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced hesitatingly, but with increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe, if you was tc bring me some</seg><seg type="columnLine">more trade like that, at the regular price, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could pay you a commission?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Dad' Mr. Charteris isn't-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, just leave my business to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marg'ret.

Jardine demanded. "Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked you to say what they want or don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">want? If I says they'll take cash-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They probably won't," Charteris inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted mildly. "They'd have to turn it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into goods to be able to do business in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own markets. However, never mind about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that now. When your stock runs out, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't take any more trade.

"Good night, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jardine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Margaret gave him her hand with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitation.

She walked to her deck cabin still</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinglingly conscious of the touch of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her first impulse was a mirror.

But Ogulo</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the gig-wharf when Charteris</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached it, and the moment the latter step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped ashore, followed reluctantly and dubi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously by Noni, the dwarf whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gov'ment man come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Which gov'ment man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bark.

I should have liked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen Bark. He look you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sah."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charteris turned to Noni who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyeing Ogulo with warranted suspicion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wet cloth no good. We go get blanket."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl followed without demur, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few moments she was wrapped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck to heel, like an Indian squaw, in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Charteris' blankets. When Ogulo had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted a small kerosene lamp and placed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor of the room which Charteris had</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed for his own, Noni squatted near it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waited placidly for the next move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently she knew of no reason why</seg><seg type="columnLine">she should fear any hurt at her father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Certainly she did not know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been brought there to be put on</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial for her life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Ogulo went in search of Abado,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Gray Charteris</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Charteris stepped on to the veranda to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">a watchful eye upon the river. He hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the light of the lamp would induce</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arthur Garriman Bark to return. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">undoubtedly be much better for Arthur to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to him, than he to be compelled to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">in pursuit of Arthur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ogulo found Abado in the galley; also</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abado's eldest son, Etaji, a big, raw-boned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sobo, naked above the waist and as unemo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional as an owl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had spent an unhealthy hour dodg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Bark, and though Abado appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken a new, if sullen, lease on life, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore his overcloth much as Noni wore her</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket; and, having partaken of both food</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drink, his manner suggested that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter had consisted of a drop too much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm wine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He made no comment when Ogulo ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised the arrival of Noni; but Etaji, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">also had been too intimate with a demijohn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted the announcement with a grunt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction and hurried eagerly up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rickety galley stairs. Abado, preceding</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ogulo, followed solemnly and leisurely after.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment Noni lifted her big squirrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and saw Etaji come so silently and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly into the room, she knew that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">intentions were far from amiable. His un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotional, owl-like look was gone. In its</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead was a bristling desire for violence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, in simple truth, was too inflamed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm wine to wait for a more fitting oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity. His pleasure at finding Noni alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a hideous thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noni's mouth opened, but the sound she</seg><seg type="columnLine">made was immaterial. Unable to reach her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet quickly enough because of the trailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of the blanket, she crouched away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him, gapingly intent upon his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etaji did not raise his voice. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the girl and, in a low, waspish mono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone, hurled Sobo epithets at her head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing the Jakri mother who had borne her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as efficiently and completely as he could in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time at his disposal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as the scuffling of Abado and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ogulo'g naked feet came to his ears, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage suddenly mounted to a wild fanatical</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzy, and as swiftly as a conjuror pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duces a rabbit from a hat, he snatched from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the folds of his overcloth an ugly, broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bladed Hausa dagger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noni screamed. The sight of the naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel loosened her voice, and Etaji's lunging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">body made her stupefied muscles stir</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to allow her instinctively to roll</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etaji struck, and the blade sank into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">folds of the blanket with sickening ease.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortunately, there was none of Noni in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that part of the blanket. Though she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily pinned to the floor, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like a pig in a sack, Etaji had lost grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the haft of the knife as a result of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious eagerness, and, ere he could recover</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, there were encircling arms about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his waist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were not Noni's arms. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only half-conscious when Etaji's floundering</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight was removed from her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The arms were Ogulo's, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound about Etaji's waist like the coils of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">constrictor, lifting him up and up until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small of the Sobo's back was hugged against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ogulo's barrel chest. Then the dwarf</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned. Etaji, with what breath was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his body, screeched in agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abado stood in one doorway, Charteris</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the other. Both saw the Hausa dagger</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pinned Noni's blanket to the floor so</seg><seg type="columnLine">perilously close to Noni's head. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Etaji kicking his legs in mid-air--</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpsed his protruding eyes, his pain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror as he shifted his head this way and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--and Charteris saw Ogulo's grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All in the space of a few seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charteris barked an order that filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room with a low sharp thunder. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ogulo-of-the-long-arms had not killed a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in many moons, and surely this man should</seg><seg type="columnLine">die! To him Charteris' voice was but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper, and he paid no heed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, he thought, when the feebly</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicking legs of his victim would cease to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kick, he would lift Etaji higher than his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and hurl him from him again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again till his broken body no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirmed or twitched. Then would Etaji</seg><seg type="columnLine">be forever damned--just as he was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the midst of these promising prognos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tications, Ogulo felt a hand fasten itself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nape of his neck, while the vagrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb of another hand searched for and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found his left eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A split second later, Ogulo stood upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his toes, a harsh guttural of pain leaping si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">multaneously from his throat. He dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etaji with a suddenness that would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been as unpleasant as it was inconvenient,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Etaji had been in any condition to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Sobo lay where he fell, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ogulo flung up his hand to tear Charteris's</seg><seg type="columnLine">excruciating grip away from his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charteris made no effort to contend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession. On the contrary, he released</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ogulo so quickly that the dwarf was wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprepared for the next move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just a little shove, a single step backward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flying, but accurate right toe, and Ogulo</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled across Etaji's unmoving form</seg><seg type="columnLine">without let or hindrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He did not stay down. Neither did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charteris' second attempt meet with quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much success. Ogulo was too far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away--and going. He went down-stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">four at a time, his shadow of a soul shrink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing almost to nothingness in a fear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove all thought of man-killing out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunted body. It sent him down to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">post on the gig wharf with a horrible sensa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that the gray man's eyes were burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes in the middle of his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charteris, however, did not follow any</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther than the top of the stairs. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a light and wholly unmusical laugh, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to his room again to find Abado</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending inquiringly over Etaji.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noni, having pulled the Hausa dagger out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the blanket and the floor, stood shrink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly in a corner holding the ugly weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly in her hand, as though prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charteris simply held out his hand, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl, glancing furtively past him toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father and her now feebly stirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother, relinquished the knife into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping without a word. He quietly or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered her to sit down and set her the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample by seeking his corner and seating</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself among his scanty possessions, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he added the knife as a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finding himself a cigaret, he said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abado through a cloud of smoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Etaji finis'. When he fit to walk, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk home. Palaver set."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abado raised his head slowly, altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobered by his son's startling attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the law of the family into his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. He glanced at Charteris, ignored</seg><seg type="columnLine">Noni completely, then looked heavily down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Etaji again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He finis'. I savez. Palaver set."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose and, choosing a spot on the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room midway between Noni and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charteris, sat down, folded his arms about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees and waited for Etaji to recover</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own accord. No one spoke. Char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teris finished one cigaret and lighted an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Noni huddled in her blanket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching her father and Etaji out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently her brother staggered wildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet, drawing deep and tortured</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaths into his lungs. He stared unbe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lievingly at Noni, searched inquiringly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the folds of his overcloth for the absent</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife, then, because his legs weaved uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly under him, he lurched against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest wall for support.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charteris said to him after a minute or so:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Etaji finis'. Go home. Palaver set."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etaji did not understand that at first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So Charteris repeated it, and Abado con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmed it by paying not the slightest at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention to his son's protests and pleas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Etaji was convinced that sentence</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been passed upon him, he flung himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Abado's feet, groveled, whined, beat his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead soundly upon the floor, tore at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crinkly hair and generally indicated that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light of his father's eyes did not shine</seg><seg type="columnLine">benignly upon him, life was well lost for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Had he pleaded with a stone image,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have received as much satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. And finally, Charteris ordered him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply and concisely, to shut up and get out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etaji departed. With moaning lamen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tations he trailed from the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the galley stairs, cogitating sadly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evils of palm wine and his ever too-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasty knife-hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a further word of comment upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter, Charteris turned to Noni and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked her to give him her closest attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was not so easy. The girl could</seg><seg type="columnLine">still hear the low hum of the vibrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife blade as its point was buried in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitch pine floor within the fraction of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch from her ear. A sound like that, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances under which Noni heard it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is likely to interfere with all other sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some little time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless, when Charteris began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak, Noni listened. In less than a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">she heard nothing but the simply con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed sentences that fell from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue. And it was not that the voice had</seg><seg type="columnLine">any hypnotic effect; it was simply the bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den of what he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Briefly he explained to her the position</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which her evidence, given before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">provincial commissioner, had placed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Gray Charteris</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ii3</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">father. He further made clear the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstance that Abado, being a fugitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">from justice, was fleeing, not only from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">government's officers, but also from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agwala would be only too anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assist the government in its search of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abado, and, plausibly enough, deliver him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up more dead than alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noni stared. Her eyes seemed to grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger and bigger every moment, as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">gapingly appreciated Abado's situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She realized it so well after a while that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked upon her father fearfully as upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of one who was already dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agwala was great. Agwala was rich.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agwala never slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Abado was in his hands, between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger and his thumb, like the broken shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a ground-nut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE darkness beyond the light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little lamp deepened percep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tibly. Vague night sounds upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river seemed to become muffled in a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She knew now why Etaji had struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her tongue, innocent of any evil inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, had betrayed her father into almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">unescapable danger, and there was but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequel to that. Etaji, drunk on palm wine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tried to consummate that sequel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was only the first. The others</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be so precipitate nor so careless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Noni had too many relatives to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vengeance of all of them. At once, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a frantic haste, she crawled nearer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charteris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I no savez gov'ment palaver. Them</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bark man say he be Abado frien'. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">he be big man for gov'ment, and no fit to lie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He talk sweet mouf too much!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She glanced toward Abado, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to say. Charteris also was silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Noni was quick to appreciate that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathies would be more surely reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">than those of her father, and she crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">still nearer with the evident intention of put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting herself definitely under his protection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I talk true! I no savez them Bark man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet mouf talk. I be small so-so girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I no savez gov'ment lie palaver!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charteris nodded coldly. Noni smiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a pitiful little smile, something like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">watery glint of sunlight when the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">tornado clouds are making all things</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurry for cover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she stopped edging nearer to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">queer gray man who had a small-boy's face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She knew that she had gone as near as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared; knew it without knowing why, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even then she wondered vaguely if Missy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cap'n Jardine or the white mammies on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white ship would ever go any nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that was not why she smiled. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had crawled up to the gates of a hope and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found them barred. Fear, sickening and</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible, raced down her spine to the soles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her little feet, and shook her lithe young</seg><seg type="columnLine">body as death shakes thp lean frames of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very old; and yet Noni smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men have earned the Victoria Cross for</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesser deeds of valor than that. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, nervously and pitifully alternating</seg><seg type="columnLine">between pidgin and Sobo, and speaking as</seg><seg type="columnLine">as child speaks when it is confronted with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery, she told Charteris again that be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause Arthur Gawiman Bark was a govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment agent, who had claimed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">government had always been friendly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abado, she had believed him. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted him more surely when he pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that if it had not been for the white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abado would still be a small boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white man, Bark had said, had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abado's genius for trade a chance to express</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, had protected him at all times and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevented Agwala from harming him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The white man, therefore, was unquestion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably Abado's friend, and in the matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alleged boycott, of which Bark had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard whisperings, the white man's govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was anxious to protect Abado's</seg><seg type="columnLine">future in trade. *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He, Bark, was the representative of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man's government. Consequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, too, was Abado's friend. There could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no doubt about it. It would be to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abado's interest if Noni would tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth to the big commissioner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this point Abado raised his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked searchingly at his daughter.

Then, to Noni's everlasting sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize, he said to Charteris simply, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">cryptically--</seg><seg type="columnLine">H4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The lie is brighter tharfthe light on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man's ships."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abado referred to the search-light carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some stern-wheelers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Abado, the tortoise speaks," Charteris</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned sonorously, aparently under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing what the Sobo meant.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked pointedly--•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is the voice of one the voice of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times ten?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abado halted.

The raft was secured by a chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a pile driven into a sand-bar, which cleft</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flood several yards above, but beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">and around it swirled treacherous waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose depth - no living human had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Early morning mists crawled along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting current, sending up a streamer here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there to connect with the heavier dew</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds that blanketed the flanking moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain walls, cutting their forested sides into</seg><seg type="columnLine">strata and dimming the sun which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly burning its way up over the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">summits.

Clint Hawk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ins, however, was stoutly built, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandy mustache trailing between his aqui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line nose and fighter's jaw, while Tom Sal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yers was grizzled and lean, his smooth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaven features sharply chiseled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were proud, fearless men, born of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same rugged mountain stock, used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking orders from none and ruling their</seg><seg type="columnLine">respective counties like benevolent despots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Because of this similarity of temperament</seg><seg type="columnLine">and because their bailiwicks adjoined, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequently came into conflict. Each was</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealous of his official reputation, each had</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends and enemies who were not held as</seg><seg type="columnLine">such in the other's esteem, and in seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to protect or punish them accordingly, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer sometimes had to reckon with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother sheriff's power and resourcefulness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many a law-breaker, taking advantage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this well-known rivalry, sought Tom Sal-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yers' favor by telling him of slanders ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered by Clint Hawkins, and in turn lies</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached Clint Hawkins to the effect that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Salyers had said certain uncompli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary things about him behind his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">134</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus was the fire of animosity fed, harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less enough while the two men kept apart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but full of dangerous possibilities when, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanced now, they were brought face to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SIM CONLEY, with cunning fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight, gambled on this when he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge on the raft midway of the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">puted boundary.

There came to his liquor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drugged ears word that the sheriffs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their posses were closing in on him from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides; there was no gap in their lines through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he couM escape and the odds were</seg><seg type="columnLine">too great to tempt a stand-off fight. So,</seg><seg type="columnLine">racing with the minutes, he had looted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest cabin of supplies, taken possession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the raft, used by that neighborhood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood-times as a ferry, and fortified himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">against immediate capture by anchoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the whirlpool.	®</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having settled one point of law to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own satisfaction, at least, another arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two officers, who ignored Sim's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarcasm.

The men on either bank, gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the water's edge and baring their heads,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up the words from memory and sang</seg><seg type="columnLine">them through to the last verse, thunderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">bass harmonizing with plaintive minor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denizens of a lonely land, where folk</seg><seg type="columnLine">worshiped as hard as they fought, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no hypocrisy in their reverence.

"That's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper move--but who are you going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find to do it and take a chance of going up</seg><seg type="columnLine">or going under according to whether they</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the blast before the dam goes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got sixteen men who will do it," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sergeant replied promptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The miner shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wouldn't have the heart to ask them,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he announced finally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't have to. I reckon it's our</seg><seg type="columnLine">job," retorted the sergeant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the manager protested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It ain't worth the price," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let 'em blow up the dam. They'll put</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves out of a job, and somebody back</seg><seg type="columnLine">East will lose a dividend. That's better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than losing a score of good lives."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't figure on losing either," an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered the sergeant. "Our job's to protect</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and property. How would I look going</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and telling the captain that I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it for fear of getting hurt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coombs threw up his hands hopelessly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have your own way. There's no use</seg><seg type="columnLine">arguing with a soldier. He gets a few dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars a month for taking a chance of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed, and he's sore if he doesn't get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. You can do it," he declared, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you are fool enough to try it, why I'm fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to go with you. I'll send a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breed back to your camp with any word</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want. One of your own men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably be gobbled up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And so it was settled. The sergeant</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribbled a note to the lieutenant telling him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation, and it was sent off by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loyal half-breed as soon as he could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away under the cover of darkness. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platoon, led by Coombs himself, filed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a path to the creek-bed below the dam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sergeant posted his men at intervals</seg><seg type="columnLine">with instructions to take what cover they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could and shoot on sight any one approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from down the valley. Coombs had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left his watchmen and a few trusty Mexi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans to guard the buildings and the horses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He and the sergeant took up the post of</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger at the center of the dam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was like being at the bottom of a well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The face of the dam rose steeply behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The lofty mountains shut off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon on all sides. Above, the stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone with unreal brilliance, and so deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the gloom of the creek-bottom that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sergeant could not make out the guard on</seg><seg type="columnLine">One Night at Osaba</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">147</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">either side of him. Had he been right</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all in letting his men take such</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances? he wondered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, he could not back out now in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">case. That would be showing the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">feather. He must make the best of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And after a time he found that by keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes fixed before him and away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars his horizon broadened. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguish now a clump of mesquite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker than the surrounding gloom, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty yards down the canon. He had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that he could detect any movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his station and this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coombs sat within arm's reach, his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the dam, Winchester on his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I'd remembered I couldn't smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">down here I'd never have agreed to come,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he grumbled once in a hoarse whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night wore on. A coolness settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the canon bottom that made John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son wish he had ordered the men to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">their blankets. Once a stone was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodged to his right, and he grasped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Springfield, tensely waiting for an alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But none came and he relaxed. Doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">a careless trooper, he concluded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced curiously at Coombs. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">miner's attitude suggested that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to sleep. His head hung forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body was slouched. Tired out, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sergeant thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Off on some hillside a coyote barked. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was answered from the opposite side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley. The sergeant pricked up his ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was it a coyote? Or was it a signal?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the fight was improving. The clump</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mesquite stood out more distinctly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed nearer. It was nearer!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sergeant Johnson had never read "Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beth." He had never heard of the Forest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dunsinane. But as he sat there tensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his eyes glued to the thicket before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him it dawned on him that this age-old</seg><seg type="columnLine">strategem was being played. Part of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicket was moving toward him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He covered it with his rifle and waited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Could he trust his own eyes? He dared not</seg><seg type="columnLine">nudge his companion. If Coombs indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept his awakening might give premature</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning to the enemy. Was it not his</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination after all? Yes, it must be, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no further movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then to his left at the base of the'dam</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the flare of a match. The sergeant</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore. One of his men lighting a cigaret</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his express orders. He would see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">about that. He strode angrily toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. It was a mere flicker now, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to draw fire at any moment. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be a pipe the man was lighting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you doing there?" the sergeant</seg><seg type="columnLine">called in a hoarse whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His answer was the sound of running feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He in turn ran forward. The fight sput-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It all came to him in a flash now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under the cover of the mesquite boughs</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Mexican had worked to within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards of the dam and then wormed up to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the dynamite. The match was a fuse!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIT COULD hardly be called delib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erate bravery that actuated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sergeant's next move. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">recollection later of reasoning the thing out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although he did remember visions of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">toppling dam and twenty-five feet of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sprang forward. There lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wicked stick, faintly outlined in the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its fuse, tucked neatly against the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dam. He caught it up and hurled it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all the strength of his good right arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wake of the hurrying footsteps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There followed a long moment of suspense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then---cataclysm!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hurled back against the wall of the dam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the valley vomit fire. His ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums were filled to bursting with sound.--</seg><seg type="columnLine">The end of the world had come, was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the black void that followed he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the voice of the miner.. It seemed far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away--a mere squeak; yet his brain formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're not hurt, are you?" the miner</seg><seg type="columnLine">was asking anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sergeant's senses came slowly back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He put his hand to the back of his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a tremendous bump. Then bp got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that was what it was!" he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The dynamite?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll say it was," agreed the miner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckling. "I don't know whether it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to break the dam or not, but I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad we didn't have a chance to find out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let's see how your men came through it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They made the rounds together. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no one seriously hurt, although some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men had suffered minor bruises from</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying stones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After inspecting the guard, the sergeant</seg><seg type="columnLine">148</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Coombs returned to their posts. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mexicans had shot their bolt. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">remainder of the night passed without</seg><seg type="columnLine">incident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With dawn the sergeant led his detail</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the mine buildings. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coombs' spies was awaiting him there and</seg><seg type="columnLine">babbledfsomething in Spanish to the miner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have beat it," Coombs explained;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and their leader has gone for good," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">added with grisly humor. "It seems he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the way of the dynamite."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As sergeant Johnson stood talking with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him one of the guard shouted joyously--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Corporal of the guard--armed party."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson looked in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">call, and a lump rose in his throat, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the red-and-white guidon of the troop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had made an all-night march and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">defiling out of the trail into the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PARTNERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">John Joseph Scarry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ETTIN' late, 'Yank.'

"Can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a go of it on any such muck as that."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Having delivered himself of this fuming</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment, he fell into a sullen contemplation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of his companion tugging at a small tar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paulin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kenaston finished his task.

"Three-four days at the most,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we'll be back in Merauke."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yah, Merauke!" scornfully.

What do you count? You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothin' but a poor fool, an' a baby, an'--an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thievin', miserly Yank!" Kenaston's lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightened and paled, but he made no retort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men were an oddly assorted pair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in'New Guinea, where extremes meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all the ends 9f the earth. Kenaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a young American, small and wiry, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ford was New Zealand born--a man well</seg><seg type="columnLine">Partners</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond forty, heavily bearded and power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully put together. But the oddness lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">more in the types than in physique. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">American's alert quiet manner and cool gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes afforded a sharp contrast to the swash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckling speech and appearance of his older</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three months earlier, when Kenaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted in from Singapore with a small stake</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a firm determination to increase tlj£,t</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake in the bird of paradise game, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that all the hunters were far away in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior, for it was then the height of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the season. Unaccustomed as he was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle, it would have been madness for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to venture alone against the dangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hardships of the river. He had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">about made up his mind to wander along</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Australia until the following year, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance threw him in with Ford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big New Zealander's reputation in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merauke was anything but savory. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very least, he was known as a. veteran hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter gone wrong--a hanger-on in low Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloons, who was lodged and supported by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Javanese woman in a miserable bamboo</seg><seg type="columnLine">shack on the water-front. Kenaston, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, was very anxious to learn the ropes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as,possible. So, despite the earnest</seg><seg type="columnLine">warnings of a few gray-bearded merchants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he worked upon Ford until that beach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">combing individual agreed to lay his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience with the new-comer's money for</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-shares in a short late-season excursion</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the coast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their outfit was scant, for it turned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Kenaston's pocket-book alone could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stand the strain of more than bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessities. But although certain defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciencies in armament and rations had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause of a great deal of harsh recrimina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from Ford, there really had been no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for complaint. Good fortune had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been with them from the start, and for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shortness of their stay in the interior,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were now returning to Merauke with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bags that would do credit to far prouder</seg><seg type="columnLine">expeditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ford had proven himself a surly enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion, but he was a hard worker and</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-versed in the ways of the jungle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kenaston had soon marked him an ill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempered swaggering bully, but, with char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acteristic generosity, had laid it all to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's sudden enforced abstinence from</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not in the least unnerved by his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">partner's heavy growls and threats, but he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had continually avoided making matters</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worse by joining in any wordy wrangling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">All he wanted was enough experience to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able to put up a sound proposition to one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the better hunters for the following</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">season and enough money to hold up his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">end properly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ford was evidently meditating on their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">luck as he slouched on the deck of the cock-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pit.

And the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuver only added to his puzzlement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ford turned again to the locker and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced a bottle of square-face gin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What d'ye say to a drink?" he asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruffly cordial.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kenaston's heart sank, but his tone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly as he answered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. Where'd you get it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind where I got it. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty more where that come from."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Kenaston thought he now under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood the half-hidden bartering that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken place that afternoon at a native</seg><seg type="columnLine">village. He was more than a little worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this new complication, for he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine what gin would do to the already</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgruntled old-timer. It would be useless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, to remonstrate, so he pretended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">join in heartily, hoping to be able to cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">short this unexpected drinking bout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took two drinks in the course of fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, while Ford sat silently and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed two cupfuls. Then he made his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">aft to stretch his blankets. He lighted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">final cigaret and lay down on the deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the continual chink of bottle against</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup came from the bow, and he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ford was still drinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, Ford!" he hailed at last, amicably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Put it away, why don't you? We have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn out early, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut yer mouth!" was the angry re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponse. "Ain't no blasted Yankee miser</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' to tell me what to do. An' I'll turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the mornin' if I want to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, all right," disgustedly. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">care."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ford laughed bitterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh! Maybe ye don't care. Catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">you darin' to leave me behind for a day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ye'd come back to find me gone--me an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 'ole bloomin' outfit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kenaston bounded to his feet. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the man was mouthing half-pondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans and decided that it might be a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea to put a few things straight. His words</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were rapped out steely-sharp as he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his recumbent partner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Ford! I've stood a lot of talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">from you this trip, but don't you run away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the idea you've got my goat. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want trouble--and any trouble between</seg><seg type="columnLine">us is going to be with guns. Get me? Talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you want to--much good it'll do you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the minute you try any monkey busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. with this boat or with the birds, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill you so full of lead you'll think you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hardware shop. Just you chew on that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he turned back to his blankets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving Ford cursing under his breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FORD was very glum in the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He swallowed his rice and hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack and tea without a word, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldering his rifle, he strode away up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream between the mangroves and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark edge of the jungle. Kenaston plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly into the forest, following an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct animal-trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The partners were then skimming over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground they had hunted on their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the river six weeks before. Kenaston's</seg><seg type="columnLine">allotment for the day was a tree which</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the center of a small natural clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about two miles back from the stream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The birds were very shy; several hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">elapsed after a shot before they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently recovered from their fright to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to their favorite roost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bird of paradise hunters can usually de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pend upon three or four victims from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">flock in the course of a long tropic day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The requirements are infinite Spartan-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience in heat and discomfort and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderably more than ordinary skill with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">.22 caliber rifle. Jim Kenaston was amply</seg><seg type="columnLine">endowed with both these attributes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set about his work with quiet zeal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But shortly after midday, when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">retrieved his second bird from under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"dancing-tree" and was strolling back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hiding-place to wait for another shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stopped quite involuntarily and gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him into the gloomy depths of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle. The vague presentiment of lurking</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger that had been with him for the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-hour gripped all the more strongly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he scanned the shadowy mazes of ferns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">entwining creepers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got the feeling one of those black boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">is watching me," he muttered. He twitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders and scowled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half-unconsciously, in his tense survey</seg><seg type="columnLine">Partners</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the encircling thickets, he crouched to</seg><seg type="columnLine">traverse on his hands and knees the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet that separated him from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotting log where lay his water-bottle. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore his knees pressed to the rank gray moss</seg><seg type="columnLine">underfoot, he heard the unmistakable</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrant buzz of a blow-gun dart singing</seg><seg type="columnLine">past his ear.	(</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His subsequent movements were des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately hurried but by no means panicky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sudden emergencies were not new to Kenas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. Long experience out of doors had</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained his muscles and his brain to react</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly to any hint of surprize. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled and dodged from cover to cover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">zigzaging across the clearing to the lone</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree which had so lately shaken beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">a garish cataract of birds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flinging himself flat in the lush under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth, he fired three times in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which he had come. There was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">small chance that the random bullets would</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage his assailant, but he knew by report</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the untutored Papuans were awesomely</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of firearms and could often be halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a noisy show of resistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came no answering cry of pain or</seg><seg type="columnLine">defiance after the fusillade, nor any move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of foliage, so Kenaston settled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to await developments. His position was</seg><seg type="columnLine">decidedly precarious. If the unseen marks-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was alone, there was no danger of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">open attack, but it was entirely possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the thickets swarmed with savages who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily overpower one man in a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush. And ever there remained the dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace of the cruel blow-gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dam funny," he thought to himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"These chaps around here are supposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be tame. Man! I don't like those arrows."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kenaston knew what it was to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">target of a hidden foe in a white man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, but this was something new. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the deadly poisoned darts that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could leave a man blackened and distorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">after half an hour of agony filled him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that horrifying fear of the unknown that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no leaden bullets had ever been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">summon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The river was two miles distant. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly possible that the noise of his un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonted succession of shots had penetrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thick blanket of wilderness to warn his</seg><seg type="columnLine">partner. In a way, this thought was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forting. He did not want the other man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come stumbling into the same ambuscade</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was now threatening him. For a little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">while he lay very still, then parted the gras3</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of his face. There was no sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life in his green surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun, unhindered by the bare branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him, drove its fierce rays through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy cloth of his khaki coat. Myriad tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants tortured with their strong jaws, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was uncomfortably aware that two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood-leeches had entered at his belt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fasten themselves on his bare legs. But his</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst torment was nervous, burning thirst.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought of his water-bottle at the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the clearing with hot regret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A quarter of an hour passed while Kenas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton kept close watch all around and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered the situation restlessly. It .was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite possible that there had been no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than one Papuan who had dared a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot and then glided away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if he's still here, the big brute'l]</seg><seg type="columnLine">get me after dark anyway," he thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed, were there no savages at all, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospect of a night alone in the black heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jungle was enough to bring pause even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a seasoned old veteran. Running the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gantlet would be preferable to this torturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaction; waiting only made his position less</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked to his rifle, vainly wishing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a more deadly caliber. There was, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, a .30-30 Winchester stowed away in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the lockers of the motor-boat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scrimping and close figuring on their equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment had enabled the partners to purchase</seg><seg type="columnLine">this weapon for use against larger game than</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds and to serve as a protection in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">improbable event of trouble with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives. But three nights before Kenaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shot away the last cartridges on a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">swine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very cautiously now, he drew his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">up under him. Just as he was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring to his feet, he felt a dull thud against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sun-helmet. Ducking quickly below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass screen, he slid one hand over the brim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hat. Quivering fingers drew forth a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dart--slim pencil of death--from just above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the puggaree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whew!" he breathed. "I better move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Didn't know they could carry this far."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw all caution to the winds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a swerving dash for the far side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing. Muttering angrily under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, he dropped behind a thick trunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scanned the opposite thickets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, reconstructing in his mind his</seg><seg type="columnLine">former position and judging by the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">152</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the dart had taken in his helmet, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to form a fair idea of where the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurked. Twenty yards frontage of fern</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to conceal the spot. He ventured</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three searching shots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew that he was now out of range of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blow-gun and must expect the hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Papuan to change his position. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortest and surest arc around the clearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at the corner where the trail debouched.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kenaston kept sharpest watch on that side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it was not long before his eye was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rewarded by a slight movement of leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep in the green curtain. Quick as light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, he leveled his rifle and pumped four</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots at the disturbance. A hoarse cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain was his answer--and the heavy sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a big body falling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got ye, you big savage!" Kenaston</seg><seg type="columnLine">exulted as he leaped to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he controlled his impetuosity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank again to his concealment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not going over to see you, Mr. Papuan,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered. "You may have friends.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyway, these .22 slugs are not so very</seg><seg type="columnLine">potent and I don't want to risk any more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your little presents. I'll just slope, I think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Acting on his earlier determination, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a wild dodging dash diagonally from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shelter to the path. There was no out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry as he fled, nor did tattooed warriors rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">to oppose him. He heard no hiss of venom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous dart as his speeding feet hit the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">black soil of the trail. Kenaston, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not linger in his flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of a breathless mile, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted up a steep incline, he realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not being followed. He slowed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid walk--until the plain print of a naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot heading away from the river brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him up short.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he stared, fascinated, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fan-like spread of the toes. A sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehension flashed across his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The boat!" he gasped, and hurried on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But presently, when he burst out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glaring sunshine of the river-bank, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw their battered craft, floating apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmolested at the edge of the bar. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched carefully for further trace of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">footprints, but there was none in the sand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the savage had come near the boat at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, he had contented himself with spying</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shelter of the thicket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kenaston was convinced by now that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to do with a prowling lone native--who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had got a lesson for his temerity--so he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">clambered aboard and started to throw to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether their meagre supper. He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Ford would say to his adventure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 /$ I DARK approached, however, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">j	Ford did not come back to the boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">l4_Mi It was altogether unusual for either</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the partners to be still in the jungle after</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour before sundown, so Kenaston began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have an uneasy misgiving that his part-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, too, had fallen in with hostile blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, perhaps, had come out second best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very much undecided as to the course he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should pursue, he made his way up-stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a mile or more until he came to the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Ford's shod trail left the open to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow a path through a vast ironwood</seg><seg type="columnLine">grove. Kenaston did not hesitate. 'For all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lateness Qf the hour, he plunged into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom of the forest until the quick fall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">night made it impossible to go any farther.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stayed there for an hour, shouting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing off his rifle at intervals. But no an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swering signal came back from the dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After countless stumbles and falls, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanderings from the path, he made his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stream. As he emerged from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ironwoods, a distant gleam of light from</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the lowlands reminded him of the na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive village where his partner had got the gin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those blackbirds there are at the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this!" he decided. "Here's where I find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, if it costs me my head."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deliberately laying his plan of action, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped back to the boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt very much as if he were running</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head into a lion's throat as he started</seg><seg type="columnLine">his engine and turned into the current. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew only a few words of the scant Papuan</seg><seg type="columnLine">language, and he knew full well that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with a .22 rifle would be of small avail</seg><seg type="columnLine">against an onslaught of treacherous blacks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But his heart was cold with anger. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to leave no stone unturned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding and punishing the miscreants who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were responsible for the non-appearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his partner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drove the bow of his motor-boat deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the muddy water-front of the straggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatched village. Two or three-score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked savages--warriors and women--left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circle of fires and crowded to watch his</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing. Wondering at his own daring, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American leaped ashore, and apparently un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned, strode through the midst of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chattering spectators to the lighted com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound in the center of the huts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Partners</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">153</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Mombo!" he demanded sharply, calling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the name of the chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Kenaston held his rifle ready and gazed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around the circle of glistening faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The old man with whom Ford had done</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his bargaining the day before squirmed out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from between two stalwart giants and faced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the white man in the open. With his few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">words--and helped by elaborate signs--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Kenaston made known that he was looking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for his partner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The chief shook his head decidedly. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had seen nothing of Ford. But the American</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was not to be put off so easily. Snatching</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">off his hat, he thrust it under the native's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nose to show the hole made by the dart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The old man looked at it and seemed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shrink. Then he broke out into a passionate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">discourse that was entirely incomprehensible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to Kenaston. He gestured to the firelit ring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of warriors and the white man remembered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to look for the marks of recent wounds. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">found nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suddenly he grasped the chief by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arm and signed for a tour of the houses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Every moment he expected to feel the hot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stab of knife or arrow, but he shoved the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">muzzle of his rifle against old Mombo's ribs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and led the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Very thoroughly he searched every house</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for some property of Ford's--his rifle, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">boots, his coat--but without success.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as though every human lineament had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been suddenly erased from the countenance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a big, broad-shouldered man, and brute</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, brute lips and brute teeth painted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead.

Garvey's fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head seemed somehow to have acquired a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorilla-like slant.

Their palates, educated to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high degree of exaction under the Garvey</seg><seg type="columnLine">regime, were suddenly confronted with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy, food-mangling ministrations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beehan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord!" murmured Bolton in dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">may when he looked over the sorry mess</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the new cook called a meal. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang'll lynch him if he keeps up that gait!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THREE tall bottles stood on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf in the cook-car.

The clerk had issued them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garvey only a couple of days prior to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure. Garvey had not had occasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use much of the extract, but now--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great guns!" exclaimed Bolton to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. "What can the fellow be doing with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that extract? Why, the quart of lemon is</seg><seg type="columnLine">already half gone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sims afforded the desired enlightenment</seg><seg type="columnLine">because that evening, when he entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commissary to buy tobacco, the clerk en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sims, did you use any of that lemon</seg><seg type="columnLine">extract?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gandy dancer shook his head in</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompt negative. Then, noticing Bolton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled demeanor and realizing the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk's greenness about certain matters that</seg><seg type="columnLine">appertained to a gandy dancers' camp, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested mildly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of c-c-c-c-c-c-c-course, there's some c-c-</seg><seg type="columnLine">c-c-c-c-cooks that d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clerk took a short cut to knowledge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time helping Sims out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">articulative flounderings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What!

Bolton surmised at once that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beehan, who was probably broke and get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting over the effects of a city spree, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">having drunk his pint of whisky had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorted to the extract to soothe his jumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves. On the following morning his</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppositions were crystallized into certain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties by the pronounced lemon-aura that</seg><seg type="columnLine">invested Beehan's person. The cook's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dull; the varicose web-work about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose was fiery red; he moved about like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man under the influence of a drug. Bolton</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked that the ravaged bottle had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">refilled with a pale liquid. During a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Beehan's absence he tasted it and found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had conjectured, that it was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. He noticed also that the bottle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanilla likewise had been attacked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The fool will kill himself if he tackles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that egg coloring," thought Bolton. "What</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the deuce shall I do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The gandy dancers were already roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a new cook, because it had become evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent to the most feeble comprehension that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extract-guzzling, food-mutilating Bee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">han could not be tolerated long in his pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent capacity. The potatoes that he dished</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to appease the gaunt gandys were</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually half-cooked; his bread was either</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the status of dough or scorched to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a semblance of charcoal; his beans were</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply indigestible; his "Java" suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">much by comparison with ooze from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the fabled Styx. How they</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed the master hand of Garvey!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beehan suddenly stopped drinking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extract, which afforded relief to Bolton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the peak of his disgust, however, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk had written to headquarters as fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         Drayton, Pa., Aug. 23.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Metropolitan Commissary Company,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gentlemen:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Please ship at once one dozen quarts of extracts,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">assorted, for beverage purposes.

At the top of a rocky escarpment that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose on one side of the pathway to the Pidgin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coop, he secreted himself. Dusk was falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly over the landscape; but before it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely rubbed out the visibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things beneath, the clerk descried some</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant figures coming along the pathway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three, he finally counted. Each of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be carrying a bundle. As they</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed by Bolton's hiding place, fifty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, a sudden blasphemous outburst</seg><seg type="columnLine">punctured the evening stillness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slade--I thought so," muttered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Gryce," he supplemented a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later when another voice arose in angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">criticism of the crum boss' outcry.

The reason why he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped drinking the extract was now quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear. With sixty men to feed, and drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ajdaily ration that was competent under</seg><seg type="columnLine">good handling to feed eighty, he had never-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">theless been providing food that was scarce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly sufficient for the needs of forty.

The car lying next</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the commissary was the cook-car, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond that lay the dining-car. The sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-cars of the gandy dancers, the foreman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the assistant foreman were at the far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther end of the string and there was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of any of the sleepers being awak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened by the slight noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spur ran slightly down grade to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main line; and the main line itself, for a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance of twenty miles south, ran down a two</seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent, grade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gryce climbed the ladder to the roof of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car and stood by the brake wheel.

Soon the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of Bolton's commissary, in alien hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the three thirsty thieves tagging along</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the wagon, had disappeared in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">STUTTERING SIMS crawled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath Bolton's bunk and grate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">' fully stretched his cramped legs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stutterer was badly frightened. First</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked cautiously out of the door in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction the looters had gone; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned an apprehensive gaze upon the well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nigh empty car. It was a desolate-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">commissary that met his view. Instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neat and plentiful array of articles that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clerk had confided to his care, there re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained nothing now but a few bags of</seg><seg type="columnLine">turnips and potatoes and some miscellane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous articles of little value.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sims had long since abandoned the habit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cursing which, in his case, consumed too</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">much time and energy.

An indistinct murmur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of voices then reached his ears through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nocturnal stillness. The thieves were</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently returning. Presently Sims could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear their footsteps scruffing along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky road. So close did they pass to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden watcher that he could see, even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness, that two of the men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering. Gryce's sneering tones snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Th' tight-wad!

Both cook and crum boss ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be half-drunk. Beehan clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newly opened bottle, swung it avidly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips and swilled a gill of it at a pull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The absconding cook's face was the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a beet and his eyes blinked owlishly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still clasping the liquor bottle and pressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it almost to his bosom as though fearful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its escape, he squatted unsteadily down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Bolton's bunk with a long sigh that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to terminate his immediate activity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crum boss glared angrily at him. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, with a snarl, Slade reached over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yanked the bottle from the cook's hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wanta go t' sleep wit' it, Bee'n?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded with appropriate sarcasm.

There was that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes that could easily be read by a sober</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. Comprehension of his dastardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme came to the stutterer in a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash. The unscrupulous gandy dancer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">170</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">making his accomplices drunk with the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">in view of appropriating the entire proceeds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crime to himself. He would steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">their share of the money and decamp, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them drunk and helpless against dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery in the very car that they had looted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the car was standing at the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed to traffic on the main line!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having progressed thus far in its reason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, Sims' brain grasped its duty and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity at the same instant. His fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers slid into his overalls pocket and drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth the key that Bolton had entrusted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his unworthy care. Then, suddenly spring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing forward, the stutterer slammed the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut and locked it. Almost instantly came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hail of insane cursings from within, ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">companied by heavy poundings on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked door. Sims, having atoned in slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure for his delinquent guardianship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave vent to his feelings by a half-hysterical</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh of happiness and relief. The three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thieves were locked in the car they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbed and the key was in his pocket. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows were only a foot square--too tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">to permit escape. The lock, the car door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the framework were stout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stutterer had already started toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp with the intention of arousing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang when the crash of glass made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitate. Then he heard a scraping sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one of the windows. Rushing back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car he observed Gryce, whose features</seg><seg type="columnLine">were readily discernible by the lamplight</seg><seg type="columnLine">within, whittling industriously away at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the window frames with a clasp knife;</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking no doubt to enlarge the aperture</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently to permit of escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *'I'll give y'u fifty t' git outa here!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled hoarsely when he saw the stutterer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sims made no reply. He paced back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth beside the car--on guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A hunnerd!" shouted Gryce in a frenzy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stutterer could not have given his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts speech, even if he would. The ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement of events had taken his slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">vocal faculty completely from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hunnerd an' fifty!" howled the impris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oned man, made desperate at length by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">captor's indifference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two hunnerd--all I got!" he shrieked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, pledging the three rogues' entire capital</seg><seg type="columnLine">to liquidate his importunities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blast y'u, y'u stutt'rin' -!" yelled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the furious gandy dancer, in tardy identifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation of his silent captor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He proceeded to threaten Sims with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of physical torture, of which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most mild and least offensive form was</seg><seg type="columnLine">"cutting his heart out." Finally, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither his bribes nor his threats had sufficed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to elicit even one stuttered syllable from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent man on guard, Gryce fell to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">again with his knife in an effort to enlarge</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window opening. Sims picked up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of ballast from the road bed and cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">it neatly through the aperture, striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gryce upon the mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' "B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-belly-robber!" he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded scornfully at last--the most oppro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brious epithet at his command.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vile oaths in recognition of Sims's true</seg><seg type="columnLine">aim, popped out of Gryce's mouth like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">string of firecrackers. The trapped man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to render his face less conspicuous, there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon extinguished the light. An irregular</seg><seg type="columnLine">cadence that jarred upon his ear, like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strings of a viol discordantly jangled, told</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watcher that Gryce's partners in crime</seg><seg type="columnLine">had guzzled their way into oblivion. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were utterly drunk and consequently per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The indefatigable rascality of Gryce, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, held the stutterer to his guard. Sims</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reluctant to go to camp in search of</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistance for fear the master crook of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little band by some means should escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shame of his dereliction had stiffened</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a determination that there should be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">second lapse of duty on his part. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved to remain beside the jail car until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bolton returned, or until someone else in</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority accidentally discovered him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About three o'clock in the morning a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong uneasiness took hold of Sims. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first passenger train on the northbound</seg><seg type="columnLine">track would be Number Three--due in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drayton about six o'clock'--nevertheless</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was always a chance that a drag of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coal empties would come lumbering up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley and surprize him. Sims determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be prepared for this contingency. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into the neighboring woods to gather</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush and twigs for a signal-fire in case he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should hear the rumble of an approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scarcely had he begun to collect these</seg><seg type="columnLine">materials, however, when a series of loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashes against the car door brought him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to his post on the run. Gryce had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally become desperate. His unsubmissive</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature was charged with fury over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of arrest--especially when effected</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Commissary in the Hills</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">171</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through such contemptible instrumentality</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as that of "Stutt'rin' Sims." The caged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gandy dancer, therefore, had brought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bolton's desk to bear on the door as a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">battering ram with which to smash himself</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out of custody. The car trembled and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rocked back and forth on its springs from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the force of the blows. Suddenly it began to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">move down grade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sims sprang nimbly up the ladder and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strained against the brake wheel, but the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brake seemingly could not be applied. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mechanism had not been used for months,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or years, perhaps. It was rusty and in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">effective. The stutterer uselessly spent his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strength in an attempt to coerce the re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fractory device; and, while he strove, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">car gained speed. Great shadowy bulks of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mountains seemed suddenly to be rushing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up at him out of the darkness and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stutterer's timid soul quaked with terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He realized that descent from the car with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out injury had become out of the question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Therefore abandoning his futile efforts to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tighten the brake, he flattened himself</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cautiously full length along the roof of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">car, grasping the brake-post with both</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands to steady himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He quailed with apprehension of a splin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tering crash that might come at any mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment in case the runaway left the rails or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">collided head-on with an approaching train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A frantic screaming that rose shrilly above</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the dull roar of the flying box-car told him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the prisoner Gryce was likewise aware</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the grave peril. It was just as well for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the other two--submerged in merciful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drunkenness--that they did not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mile after mile the commissary car</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plunged downward through the foot-hills of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Alleghanies, thumping violently on its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">straining springs, careening around curves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and filling the still air with the menacing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thunder of its flight. Past a little hillside</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">station it sped. Sims could see the operator</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">start up from his instrument and peer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sharply through the window into the dark-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ness as they flashed by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Colburn," thought the stutterer. "Ten</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miles from Drayton. Next station, Mid-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vale--eight miles farther--end of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grade."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He feared the Colburn operator would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wire Midvale to switch them off, because</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they were running south on the northbound</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">track. This operator naturally would have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no means of knowing that the runaway car</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">carried human freight. Gryce's yells for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some reason had subsided, and the gandy</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancer had extinguished the light before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car had left Drayton. Sims himself was</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly incapable of a shout--moving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain would have been an equally easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">task for him at the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">JUNCTION VVHERt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">J»AY CAR STOPPED	^ BARN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Just north of Midvale the grade suddenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spent itself, and the speed of the car dimin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ished; but even as Sims was drawing a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">breath of thankfulness over the thought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that all danger was past, he espied the Mid-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vale operator rushing, lantern in hand, over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the switch.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen husky brawlers from the woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">aligned themselves in his alcoholized brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a strong defensive cohort.

The great empire of Genghis Khan</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been broken up five hundred years ago. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave of nomads, the Mongols from the steppe</seg><seg type="columnLine">country of Central Asia, had settled back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the name of the mighty conqueror, Genghis</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khan, was only a legend in the land; the grim figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lame Timur (called Tamerlane in European</seg><seg type="columnLine">histories) had held its sway among the mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Central Asia and rested now in the tomb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Other nomads, the Chagatai Mongols--called by</seg><seg type="columnLine">us the Moguls--had arisen in the mountains north</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Afghanistan, had ruled India, with splendor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom; but their descendants of the peacock throne</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only effigies who watched the incoming of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portuguese, French and English. Warren Hastings</seg><seg type="columnLine">is mentioned in our histories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But India itself is separated from Central Asia by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Himalayas, and only Tibet had a hand in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing of the Giants. Tibet--as we call it; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants term it Po, and the castle-temple at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lhassa the Po-tala--was the religious center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Central Asia, a kind of transmountain pope ruling</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a hierarchy of priests, with spies, disciples</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a fine system of news collection by mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">couriers. The authority of the Dalai Lama or King-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priest extended from the Chinese side of the Gobi</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert (Pekin) to the outposts of the Russian armies</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Volga, and from Lhassa to the Arctic Circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TN OTHER words, the Dalai Lama had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself spiritual master of a space about as</seg><seg type="columnLine">large as the United States of America. This space--</seg><seg type="columnLine">steppe land in the center, deserts and mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">on three sides, the frozen tundras of Siberia (then</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Russian Tatary) to the North--was still held</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the nomad tribes, the Tatars. They were not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, the united Horde of Genghis Khan, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups of separate tribes, herdsmen, with vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">traditions of former battles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some were under Russian rule, others--in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Gobi region--were existing under the firm but</seg><seg type="columnLine">benevolent hand of Ch'ien-lung who was emperor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of China at the time of China's greatest power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some more of the Tatar clans were imbued with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mohammedanism, or were allies of the Dalai Lama.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they were--and are to this day--independent</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaps. The Torguts especially--the clan called the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Giants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TPHE Torguts, about 1620, during the brief empire</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Galdan Khan in the mountains of Central</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asia (the empire touched upon in the story "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolf Chaser,") refused servitude and migrated west</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as the Russian border, on the Volga. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">they built villages and remained, contented enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fighting and cattle raising.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the various Muscovite states were</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed into an expanding empire under the vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous hand of Peter the Great and, after him, Cathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rine. The Torguts were threatened with taxation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with seizure of their sons by the Russians. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape servitude, a second time, they chose to migrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their homeland at the headwaters of the River Ili,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then unoccupied. Ch'ien-lung had extended them</seg><seg type="columnLine">an invitation to do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And they did it. At the time no one thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible; the . distance was three thousand miles;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was then the dead of Winter on the snow-bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">steppe. They had the disadvantage of covering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldest region of their journey in a temperature</seg><seg type="columnLine">around zero and crossing the two deserts and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alai Bagh in mid-Summer. They also had their</seg><seg type="columnLine">herds with all their possessions to transport.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ESTIMATES as to the numbers of the Torguts</seg><seg type="columnLine">vary somewhat. Pallas calculates that 150,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">Torguts set out from the Volga; the annals of Ch'ien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lung mention 40,000 to 50,000 tents (more than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">200,000	persons). But it is known that only 70,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">survived to reach the Ili. In other words, seven out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of about seventeen souls lived through the journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You see, they had to fight their way; the tribes</seg><seg type="columnLine">along their route, and especially to the south, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostile, the Moslems vindictive, the Cossacks gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">them two stiff battles, and their own lamas were</seg><seg type="columnLine">deceitful--anxious to betray them if anything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be gained by it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This journey of the Giants has been called "a</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal trek." So it vvas--the last of the great men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS TO the rate of progress made by the Tatars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have set it down as it happened. Thirty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty miles a day at times under the conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds like a tall order. Yet it was done. Also the</seg><seg type="columnLine">150 miles of the Hunger Steppe, or desert, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversed in three days. This was necessary be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause the "yellow" water was found to be un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinkable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How they managed for fodder for the herds on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow steppe I do not know. Of course the beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">died off rapidly and it is rather a miracle that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of the herds endured for the first half of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey. As for the camels, they got along well</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough and the ponies, it seems, dug into the snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">at times for grass underneath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(~)N THEIR journey they carried off a European,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who appears in the story.

But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disciples of Buddhism who were establishing them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves in Tibet about 1100 a.d. found the native</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil-worship too strong to wipe out. So the home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bred conjurers, the mik-thru tse khen, were enrolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the priesthood of the Buddhists. Eventually the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil-worshipers became the prime movers among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain monks.

Quetzal was the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">deity of Cholula, one of Mexico's oldest cities still</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabited at the coming of the Spaniards. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an early king of miraculous birth.

He took no wife, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">founded convents for women sworn to chastity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted to temple worship.

Its physiological action is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyze the end-plates of motor nerves. Thus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without affecting the central nervous system at all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it causes complete paralysis of all muscles. Death</seg><seg type="columnLine">is due to paralysis of heart and respiratory-muscles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Curare has no other action; it does not affect con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness nor is it anesthetic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though it has been used in tetanus (lock-jaw) in</seg><seg type="columnLine">doses of 1-25 to 1-10 grain, it is rarely used as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine; but it is very largely used in laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments upon animals, because it does abolish</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possibility of movement without affecting either</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness or sensibility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But all that is by the way. The important and</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting thing about curare is that it is inert</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless introduced directly into the body-fiuids. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be swallowed even in large quantities without</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill effects, because it is broken up in the stomach</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the digestive process. Introduced into the blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, however, by hypodermatic injection, or by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dart, knife or arrow impregnated with it, curare is</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly poisonous. It acts almost instantly, paralyz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all muscles, so that its victim drops at once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inert. And that victim may be eaten with impunity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because as I have said, curare is broken up during</seg><seg type="columnLine">digestion. (Of course, if one had a gastric ulcer or</seg><seg type="columnLine">open wound of stomach, aesophagus or mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough curare might enter the blood-stream to cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">i8o</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">death; and I have seen one or two natives--in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brazil--die while eating game knocked over with</seg><seg type="columnLine">curare-poisoned arrows, undoubtedly because of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">very thing.)

I'll venture a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemist could go out and locate quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little army of offenders almost any day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor has new York any monopoly on unfit</seg><seg type="columnLine">food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All sort of ridiculous, isn't it? I wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">just how much human damage 93 pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of candy "unfit for human consumption</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do? To a little child, say, or an adult</seg><seg type="columnLine">already in a dangerous condition of health.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe quite a few cases of "ptomaine" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps here or there, and maybe not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks afterward, a death. Quite possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow, isn't it? And the gent who hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it out gets $93 or five days. Such a severe</seg><seg type="columnLine">penalty should amply satisfy the sorrowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">family of any one who had passed out as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct or indirect result of the selling of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of food. Also, so terrible a penalty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging over their heads and put into</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation so seldom that it becomes a mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of newspaper news will surely terrify all</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealers out of ever again offering food unfit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for human consumption. Probably never</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, as always heretofore, will any dealer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in candy, meat, groceries or vegetables ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer to New York any food that isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly fit. Five days! The awfulness of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes the chills run down a fellow's back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TT SEEMS to me mighty crude work to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stab a man or shoot him or hit him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a club. That's "murder" or "manslaughter"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and may cost you quite a few years in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">penitentiary or even hang or electrocute</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Stupid and too risky. Why not just</seg><seg type="columnLine">start a little food stand of some sort and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the man--or the woman or the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">child--as a customer. No need for hurry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Take your time. Can't you afford to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few weeks or even months? Don't insist</seg><seg type="columnLine">on direct and crude methods. Slow poison</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't always sure, but it will certainly do</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable harm and then who wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather take the rather faint risk of five days</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of the much greater risk of five years</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the electric chair? Of course you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to poison a few hundred otLer people</seg><seg type="columnLine">in whom you have no interest, but that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just part of the day's business. Don't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a foolish hurry and give him or her arsenic</seg><seg type="columnLine">or ground glass or anything like that for</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody to find when the remains are</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined. Be more patient, play it safe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid the cell and the noose, keep your good</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in the community, do it with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotten vegetable, a decayed fish or unfit</seg><seg type="columnLine">candy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Furthermore, if you're morally inclined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this method isn't wicked, while using a gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife or club is decidedly wicked. Just so</seg><seg type="columnLine">your poison comes from a food-store instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a drug-store, takes twenty-four hours or</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer to act, and isn't dead sure to produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, and just so, instead of disciminating</seg><seg type="columnLine">against your victim, you poison a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighborhood, there isn't anything immoral</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it--merely a little trick of the trade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a well-recognized business method and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to make you eventually a pillar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">society, an honor and model for your com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">munity and perhaps a church-member of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first water. While on the other hand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst you're likely to get is five days or</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dollar a pound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOR has the public any sound reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">to object. I put it to you personally--</seg><seg type="columnLine">if a fellow sold you a pound of food that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made you feel miserable for several days or</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe poisoned off one or two of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">kids or anyhow ran you up a doctor's bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them, wouldn't you feel more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">amply satisfied if that fellow had to pay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city $i? He might, you know. It does</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen sometimes, as the newspaper notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">shows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It's funny, though, when you come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it over. The law soaks it to you if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you beat a man up with your fist or a brick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or break a woman's arm or kick a child in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stomach, but if you're more subtle</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it and do much the same thing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of business instead of for personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement, why, that costs you only five</seg><seg type="columnLine">days maybe, probably not, or $i per pound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is a price any good sport or good busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness man ought to be willing to pay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances. Kick the little child's stom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ach from the inside and be safe, and cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">up your tracks by doing it to a lot of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of just one, thus being able to prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of personal animus. Also, it's darned</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to prove anything on you anyway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if some of 'em happen to die as a result</seg><seg type="columnLine">of getting rotten food at just the wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wonder just what the law means by</seg><seg type="columnLine">"manslaughter" and "mayhem" and "as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sault?"

Somehow I can't quite see why</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisoning people broadcast and by degrees</seg><seg type="columnLine">as part of your regular business is a trivial</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, while poisoning just one fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly and all at once is such a terrible and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wicked affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, well, let's go to lunch and take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance.

Those people living</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the interior and in the remote parts of the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">are very reserved. The other parts of the population</seg><seg type="columnLine">living along the lines of communication or on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea coast are of course in a sense broader than their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountaineer brothers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In general life is taken more seriously over there</seg><seg type="columnLine">than in this country. Family life is made a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of, as are all feast days and occasions, such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">weddings, Christmas, New Year, etc. But, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though you may be in a very out-of-the-way part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the country, you will never fail to find them most</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospitable and kindly in every way. And having</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norwegian blood in your veins will be an extra asset</seg><seg type="columnLine">in getting to know their intimate thoughts, ideas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and customs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The "lingo" you also must have heard something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. If you have never seen it and want to get an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea about it I should advise you to write to Bren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tano's Book-Store, 1200 F Street, Washington,</seg><seg type="columnLine">D.

Ask for the Universal Series. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">book is twenty-five cents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Information concerning the arrival of the vikings</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the shores of the North American continent</seg><seg type="columnLine">is very vague. The old Norse and Icelandic sagas</seg><seg type="columnLine">set forth at great length about Leif Ericson, who in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1,000	a.d. is said to have sailed over to some part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is now New England and called it Vinland.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But most of this information is not authentic. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">based upon the old sagas concerning these old sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rovers, and may or may not be true. Nevertheless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">true or not, the vikings certainly were a bold lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seafaring men, and did make very daring trips con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidering the ships they used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to the fish and game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Along the coast you will find about the same fish</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we have along the Maine coast, and lots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">salmon, the canning of which is one of the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">industries in Norway. In the interior and lakes you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will find trout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the north and interior you will find elk, rein-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deer and a few bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When you go over to the eastern part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country in the south along the Swedish border you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will find all kinds of birds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To shoot or fish it will be necessary for you to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a permit for both.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit is also easily obtained at a small cost.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus you will have no trouble on that score.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About one month before you go you must write</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Department of State, Washington, D. C.</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Bureau for American Passports), and ask for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">application for a passport, which will be sent you</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the necessary instruction for filling it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When you have obtained your American pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port (without it you could not leave the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States) as you will probably sail from New York,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can leave your home about two days earlier than</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to catch your ship and get it visaed</seg><seg type="columnLine">(stamped) by the Norwegian Consul-General in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. His office is in the New York telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is also absolutely necessary, as you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not land in Norway without it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are two steamer lines going from New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Norway, both having fortnightly sailing.

A one-man dog can be reared only as follows:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Take a mere puppy; allow no one to play with it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much less pet it. If any one comes near it have</seg><seg type="columnLine">him use a small stick and whip the dog--then</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he comes to you, you pet the animal. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives the dog complete confidence in y6u alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This might seem purely theory, but by experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know whereof I speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I took the fitter of an Airedale bitch of high breed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing before their eyes were opened and used a metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle to acquaint them with the sound of it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they licked milk from my finger-tips. At the age of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three weeks they would follow that whistle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">little yelps and bounds over stick and undergrowth</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was almost too much for them. At the age of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one month I had the litter--six pups--to heel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing, answering action by the calling of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">names. This might seem impossible; but I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">much proof for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2.	The wolf when raised as a pet makes quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good animal--sometimes, depending again upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his early raising. I would not advise a wolf in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 3.	Have you tried a German police dog? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">not? Go and see "The Silent Call," a feature photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">play, and see Strongheart work. He was directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in German, through the medium of megaphone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and worked like a human over half a mile distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">from camera.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 4.	I captured a bitch coyote in 1917 while</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapping in Feather River, Calif. I kept her closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded and bred her to a thoroughbred Airedale</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog. I kept her for two months, and while I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in southern California, she finally got away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the old prospector--who was nearly blind--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd left her with, and went back to her band.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">countries bordering the Mediterranean from Italy</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward, as well as those running back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Euphrates and including the coast of Syria, Asia</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minor and Egypt, are known as the "Levant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In ancient times the term "Orient" was not used,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that country was then known as the "High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Levant."
