            <seg type="columnLine">that was spilled was painstakingly scooped up</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">there was one who differed from all the rest.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Shorter in build than most of her fellows, this in-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">beside his bed. What was this thing? He was</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He remembered now. It was the object he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Excitedly he reached for it, and examined it.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was a sort of helmet, constructed of a flexible</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brownish metal, made so that it could fit snugly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over any head. Rather bulky it was, and not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">light in weight. Preston saw that it would not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only cover the entire head, but the eyes and ears</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as well. Queer triangular knobs protruded, one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">high in the center of the forehead of the thing,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and one on each side, just above that portion of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the instrument that would cover the ears. They</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turned readily at Preston's touch with little click-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder what this can be," he mused, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">realizing that to experiment was the only method</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to determine, he carefully adjusted it upon his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">head, and turned the dial-like knob on the fore-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> A sharp click, and instantly a blur of vari-col-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Nervously he turned the knob above his right</seg>
