            <seg type="columnLine"> Cheechako lay at the edge of the circle</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Mostly he watched Holliday, because Hol-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Once he rose and started forward ten-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Holliday merely glanced at him and did</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">permeating all his dreams. The odor was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The next morning he cursed in a species</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Cheechako wagged his tail politely in part-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was a ceremony that was part of the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> But Holliday, of course, did not know</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and they talked interminably. Dugan was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">jollity itself. He was soon assured that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Holliday had no suspicion of him. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had left no clue after the murder and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Cheechako--who might have gamboled</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Cheechako remembered, yes, but he did not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">though he would fight to the last drop of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> And it may be that Dugan's presence</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was always at hand. His presence and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his desperate work was due to her. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could not help thinking and dreaming of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> I have heard several explanations of the term</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"maverick." My grandfather came to Texas</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from Tennessee in the 30's and he has given me</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">My impression is that Maverick was a man who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turned loose, down about San Antonio way, a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">herd of cattle and left them without a caretaker.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Other cowmen got into the habit of branding his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">calves in the Maverick brand, so in course of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time he had numerous cattle which scattered his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brand farther and farther until his herds roamed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over most of central and north Texas. After a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">while, when a cowman found an unbranded brute</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he naturally supposed it to belong to the Maver-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ick herd; as all other men saw after the brand-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing of their own. Everybody helped Maverick.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Texas soon was overrun with cattle with Mav-</seg>
