Seems like I’ve seen him </p><p>before, but I can't quite place him.” And </p><p>Dolan’s broad face wrinkled. </p><p> The eyes of the quiet, slim young man</p><p>were still bulging. Dolan’s mighty' fist</p><p>Copyright, 1919. ly The Ridgtvay Company in the I </p><p>i," “Highly Civilized,” etc. </p><p>had sounded like a hammer hitting a </p><p>board, and yet the other man had been </p><p>armed! </p><p> “Nothin’ to be skeered about,” demurred</p><p>Dolan. “The real bad-man has his mouth </p><p>shut and his eyes open. This fool had his </p><p>mouth open. Nothin' to it. What was </p><p>you sayin' about your ranch?” </p><p> The younger man began to aline in his</p><p>mind the story which was being shrewdly </p><p>wormed from him. He had not come here </p><p>for sympathy, but he found himself granted </p><p>it anyhow; so he decided to give Dolan his </p><p>confidence because the big owner of the </p><p>Gem Saloon and General Merchandise </p><p>Store seemed to ask it. </p><p> Carlton was comparatively a newcomer.</p><p>The heavy-browed giant, with just a tinge </p><p>of gray in his black hair, was the boss of die </p><p>settlement and apparently the hardest </p><p>character in the district. By reputation </p><p>the world to him held two classes of people, </p><p>friends and enemies. The former could </p><p>have anything and the latter nothing, not </p><p>even decent tombstones. If he thought a </p><p>man should be eliminated, he would see him </p><p>killed without compunction.

Six years ago I tame through </p><p>this country on a railroad survey. One day </p><p>while hunting in the hills I came into a little </p><p>valley that made my mouth water. There </p><p>was a bare copper mountain standing over </p><p>a timbered slope leading to a liLlle stream, </p><p>and that led to a big meadow and lost </p><p>itself in a little green marsh. Willows by </p><p>the marsh, and oaks in the meadows, and </p><p>pines up the slope. It was a lost valley— </p><p>only one way in. You pass a lot of loose- </p><p>dirt scenery till you turn around a bare </p><p>granite knoll and look into—paradise!” </p><p> “That’s Lost Deer Valley, all right,”</p><p>nodded Dolan. “It’s a fine place.”</p><p> The big man smiled a bit at the rhapsody.</p><p>Carlton's regular-featured, fine-drawn face </p><p>was alight. If it were not for his square </p><p>jaw and level eyes, Dolan might have ap- </p><p>praised liim differently. But, though Carl- </p><p>ton was a “city man,” he was not a tender- </p><p>foot. He was an engineer who had sur- </p><p>veyed part of the desert. </p><p> “After I went away, I got office w'ork,”</p><p>continued Carlton. “It lasted five years, </p><p>and then I got—sick. Meantime I'd been </p><p>dreaming about that valley. So, before </p><p>the sickness pulled me down for keeps, I </p><p>decided to come out here with my wife and </p><p>settle down on the place. I had enough </p><p>money tp buy about one-third of the valley; </p><p>so I bought it. The fellow who owned </p><p>the place was Ebenezer Finch. A fine, </p><p>wholesouled, noble character. A regular </p><p>prince!” </p><p> Dolan grinned. The bitter words seemed</p><p>to caricature the miser of Lost Deer Valley </p><p>—the stoop-shouldered, sharp-faced, red- </p><p>haired slouch whose cheating and sancti- </p><p>mony were known through the county. </p><p> “He only asked a reasonable price for</p><p>the two hundred acres,” continued the </p><p>engineer. “It’s right at the lower end of </p><p>the valley, straddling the creek and strad- </p><p>dling the road that runs out. I made a </p><p>'topographic survey and planned an irriga- </p><p>tion system. The ground makes an easy </p><p>slope toward the lower end of the valley; so, </p><p>by diverting the stream where it enters my </p><p>proj&gt;ertv on the higher ground. I could run </p><p>a ditch along the inner rim of the hills and </p><p>shoot the water down to any place I liked. </p><p>The stream runs all year from Lost Deer </p><p>Spring; so I figured I’d have water enough </p><p>to raise anything. My water-right s were </p><p>perfect. Everything was line as silk. </p><p>And then the stream quh business.” </p><p> “I knew it,” grunted Dolan. “Hosses.”</p><p>“It was the horses,” nodded Carlton. </p><p>“Ebenezer Finch suddenly brought three </p><p>hundred head of stock over from his Esca- </p><p>lante ranch, and they drank the water at the </p><p>source.” </p><p> “Did you speak to him abouL it?”</p><p>“Sjjeak? 1 spoke, argued, raved, prayed </p><p>and swore! He just stood there and </p><p>sniveled his regrets.” Carlton s bitter voice </p><p>took a high-pitched, mournful intonation </p><p>that mimicked Finch's whine exactly. </p><p>“I'm right sorry abaout it," he mocked, </p><p>“but I don’t see’s haow I kin change </p><p>things. O’ course, you got your rights to </p><p>the lower stream. 1 don’t deny no man his</p><p>rights. Live an' let live—that's my mot- </p><p>tow. The law sez the man on the upper </p><p>stream kin only hold water fer domestic an’ </p><p>stock purposes; so I’m right glad to let </p><p>ye hev what I kin let through.” Carlton </p><p>took his own voice. “- him! He’s en- </p><p>titled to the upper stream for stock </p><p>purposes only, so he brought in the </p><p>stock!” </p><p> ‘ Um. How did the talk wind up?"</p><p>grunted Dolan. </p><p> “Why—he almost cried. Said I mustn’t</p><p>judge him wrongly. Told me how good a </p><p>friend he was. Described every neighborly </p><p>act he’d done. I didn’t know whether to </p><p>apologize or knock him down. Finally he </p><p>shook hands and left me standing there, </p><p>wondering. That was two months ago. </p><p>After that he’d drop over and give me help- </p><p>ful hints on how to run my ranch. Mean- </p><p>time, not a drop from Lost Deer Creek. </p><p>I	couldn’t decide whether I was being</p><p>helped or victimized till finally I stumbled </p><p>on to his full history.” </p><p> Dan Dolan chuckled.</p><p> “What happened next?”</p><p> “Well—1 can’t afford to nurse a dry</p><p>ranch; so I put it up to him straight. First </p><p>he said, ‘Harsh words butter no parsnips;' </p><p>then he just yelled. I'm not very strong; </p><p>so I used a fence-rail. Then, when </p><p>my temper went down, I regretted </p><p>things. </p><p>The Boss </p><p>“I MADE threats. I said I’d get </p><p>that water if I had to clean out his </p><p>stock and him into the bargain. </p><p>That was a month ago. Since then the </p><p>valley hasn’t been healthy for any one. </p><p>Some one’s been poisoning his horses, and </p><p>somebody tried to burn my house. I sleep </p><p>now with a shotgun alongside my bed, and </p><p>the wife’s close to hysterics.” </p><p> “Where did you learn about Finch?”</p><p>asked Dolan suddenly. </p><p> “The old Government land-agent. He</p><p>knows the whole county.” Carlton tolled </p><p>off victims on his fingers. “A man named </p><p>Brady had the ranch before me. He died </p><p>two years ago, after selling the land back to </p><p>Finch cheaply. The man before that was </p><p>Dingle or Dingwall. The man before that </p><p>was one Tom Fulton.” </p><p> “Tom Fulton?” interrupted Dolan. “Ful-</p><p>ton? Yeh, you’re right; it was Tom Fulton. </p><p>Go on.” </p><p> “The man before that was named Mor-</p><p>ris, and I forget the rest. Every one of</p><p>them lacked water, couldn’t irrigate and </p><p>had to sell the ranch back to Finch—very </p><p>cheap. Two of them had lawsuits but </p><p>couldn’t prove anything. In other words, </p><p>Ebenezer Finch uses the prettiest little </p><p>valley in the county as bait for a legal, </p><p>logical skin-game. He sells the ranch, </p><p>parches the land, terrorizes the victims in </p><p>one way or another and then gets the </p><p>ranch back through a friendly deal!” </p><p>Dolan’s stubby fingers drummed on the </p><p>table, and he stared at Carlton as if to make </p><p>sure of his estimate of the man. He saw a </p><p>decent, clean young American, neither </p><p>blond nor dark, neither brilliant nor wit- </p><p>less, but just an ordinary well-educated </p><p>young fellow who looked as if he might </p><p>be worth helping. </p><p> “That’s right,” he nodded. “It’s a</p><p>swindle. You’re stung. Might as well </p><p>pack up your duds and mosey along. </p><p>Only—I wouldn’t.” </p><p> “You mean—fight it out?” asked Carlton.</p><p>“Stick,” grunted the big saloon-keeper. </p><p>Then suddenly he became halting and </p><p>diffident, as if trying to pick the words to </p><p>outline his attitude. “I’m sort of neutral,” </p><p>he explained. “I’m jest watchin’ on the </p><p>side-lines. Mebbe I'm playin’ my own </p><p>game, at that. We’ll see. I got no special </p><p>interest in you. I’m only a booster for the </p><p>county. What we need is decent people, </p><p>ou and your wife seem like what we want. </p><p>of Mirage	5</p><p>If your sort always gits froze out, there’s </p><p>nothin’ for this county but booze and </p><p>roughs forever. Savvy?” </p><p> Carlton had hoped for understanding</p><p>from this burly, rough-handed saloon- </p><p>keeper in shirt-sleeves, but such idealism </p><p>from the owner of the worst “sin palace” </p><p>in the county was unexpected. The big </p><p>boss caught his look and frowned. </p><p> “Yeh, I know what you’re thinkin’,”</p><p>boomed Dolan’s heavy voice in its choppy </p><p>manner. “Dolan keeps a dance-haU. </p><p>Booze. Women. Dolan, the merchant, may </p><p>be different. He’s gittin’ a little old. </p><p>Beginnin’ to look ahead like a merchant </p><p>should. This country’s got to have decent </p><p>people. She’s goin’ to git ’em!” </p><p> Carlton was beginning to gage this new</p><p>friend. The big, heavy-browed fighter </p><p>stood alone in this community, and, a little </p><p>chastened by the years, without wife, </p><p>family or close pals, he was starting to feel </p><p>his loneliness. His talk was not reform. </p><p>It was friendship. The engineer knew he</p><p>had come to the right place. </p><p> “I won’t take up your fight, but you’re</p><p>goin’ to git a square deal!” continued Dolan. </p><p>“Mebbe I’ll have a scheme for you pretty </p><p>soon. Mebbe not. Anyhow, go back and </p><p>fight it out!” </p><p> “I will!” said the engineer, arising and</p><p>gripping the other’s big hand for just a </p><p>moment and then letting it go. </p><p> Effusiveness would have spoiled things,</p><p>and he knew it. Then with a nod he </p><p>walked to the door and mounted his bay </p><p>horse and started for home, heartened by </p><p>the knowledge that the toughest, shrewdest </p><p>old ruffian in the district was a friend and </p><p>possibly an ally. He was ignorant of the </p><p>political and social conditions within this </p><p>tumultuous county, ignorant of the sub- </p><p>conscious motives of Dolan and totally </p><p>ignorant of the size of the battle he had </p><p>entered into. He only knew that he had </p><p>gained a friend whose advice and backing </p><p>might be well worth while, and, thus satis- </p><p>fied, he started on the long trail toward the </p><p>green valley under the copper mountain. </p><p>II </p><p>TWO hours later Carlton was riding </p><p>along a winding road on die side of </p><p>a barren, rocky mountain range, </p><p>Sometimes, when the dust settled or side- </p><p>hills failed to obstruct his view, he could see </p><p>6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the great, hazy country spread iTelow him to </p><p>the westward, shimmering yellow and </p><p>brown in the heat-wave. Far to the north- </p><p>ward lay Dolan’s settlement, its buildings </p><p>hidden by the mist of the distance. Far to </p><p>the south the gray heat-wave blurred the </p><p>miles that led to the county-seat. </p><p> Eastward, to the left, the rocks on the</p><p>steep mountain range above the rider re- </p><p>flected baleful glares from the late afternoon </p><p>sunlight, and above those rocks he could </p><p>see the tip of the big copper dome that stood </p><p>over his home. One mile more and he </p><p>would be in the valley. The rider managed </p><p>to urge his sweaty horse into a gallop just as </p><p>something stinging and vicious whined </p><p>through the air behind him. </p><p> Carlton jumped. He jerked back on the</p><p>reins. The horse stood on its hind legs. </p><p>A muffled report came from somewhere </p><p>among the boulders above. Carlton's eyes </p><p>squinted toward a mass of gray rocks under </p><p>the shoulder of the copper mountain. </p><p> “The devil!” muttered the engineer, un-</p><p>decided, while the horse pranced.</p><p> Another bullet zipped past the animal’s</p><p>nose and spattered into a red rock below. </p><p>Carlton made up his mind instantly. He </p><p>jabbed spurs into the bay so savagely that </p><p>it laid back its ears and flew. </p><p> Over shale rock, over hard ledges, over</p><p>sandy washes the panting bay sped toward </p><p>the gateway of gray-green boulders that </p><p>marked the entrance to the valley. The </p><p>bullets ceased coming. The marksman’s </p><p>vantage-point was out of range, hidden by </p><p>cliffs and side-hills. The engineer’s mind </p><p>was working fast. The man who fired at him </p><p>had a rifle. Carlton only had a pistol in a </p><p>holster under his light khaki jacket. If he </p><p>could get to close quarters, he might inves- </p><p>tigate things. That was his plan. </p><p> The horse reached the comer of Lost Deer</p><p>Gap and started to turn in. Carlton halted </p><p>him, dismounted, slapped the animal on the </p><p>flank and walked deliberately along the </p><p>outer rim of the granile gates of Lost Deer </p><p>Valley. The horse started for home. Carl- </p><p>ton started to climb. </p><p> Warily, carefully, trying to give no hint</p><p>of his coming, the engineer scrambled up- </p><p>ward over hot ledges of gray stone or little </p><p>wastes of yellow sand. Once the ugly flat </p><p>head of a diamond-back rattler disputed </p><p>him from the top of a bluish rock, but he </p><p>gave it the right of way. Higher up a </p><p>pungent smell told him he was coming into </p><p>a nest of them; so he detoured. Still higher </p><p>he came upon the trail of a bobcat in a patch </p><p>of streak)- brown dirt, but he noticed it only </p><p>subconsciously. He was on the spine of the </p><p>ridge now, and ahead was the giant pile of </p><p>gray rocks where his enemy had lurked. </p><p>Carlton surmised who it was, but he was </p><p>not quite sure. Ebenezer Finch seemed too </p><p>sanctimonious for this sort of business. </p><p> The engineer began to cr?jwl. Hot rocks</p><p>blistered his hands, and the sun heated the </p><p>metal on his blue pistol-barrel, but he wiped </p><p>the sweat from Ills brow and kept going </p><p>ahead. He made for the western edge in </p><p>order to keep off the sky-line. His fooi </p><p>slipped on a rock which hit another, which </p><p>struck another, until a little avalanche of </p><p>rock and dirt thundered down the hill and </p><p>gathered momentum. </p><p> A bullet whistled past Carlton. A rifle</p><p>roared almost in front of him, and a wisp of </p><p>smoke blew around the corner of a big </p><p>rock. Carlton started dodging forward in </p><p>zigzag leaps. The rifle cracked again, but </p><p>he reached the rock. The smoke liad just </p><p>come from its east side; so he ran around the</p><p>west side, just as he heard the lever of the </p><p>rifle throwing another cartridge into place. </p><p>Wild with anger, aching to deal with this </p><p>assassin, the engineer forgot his shortening </p><p>wind and cha ged like a wild bull. </p><p> A vague figure moved in front of him.</p><p>blurred by the gloomy shade of the big </p><p>rock. Carlton pulled trigger just as a big- </p><p>bore rifle delivered its thundering load </p><p>through his hat. Carlton pulled trigger </p><p>twice more. The gusts of Are and smoke </p><p>turned the place into a smelly inferno. </p><p> “Yow!” came a shrill, agonized scream</p><p>from the figure in front. </p><p> Carlton's finger twitched on the trigger,</p><p>but he refrained. The man with the Win- </p><p>chester hurled it away and let it smash on </p><p>the rocks w'hile he hunched over and held </p><p>his right leg, moaning. </p><p> “What does this mean?” roared Carlton.</p><p> “Oh! Ouch!” cried Ebenezer Finch.</p><p> He sat down and swayed while his lean,</p><p>WTinkled face contorted with pain. </p><p> Carlton did not know whether to shoot,</p><p>strike, swear or laugh. The cold-blooded </p><p>attempt at assassination made him furious, </p><p>but the ludicrous figure rendered him help- </p><p>less to act. </p><p> “Well?” he rasped.</p><p> “It hurts!” complained Finch. “Wait</p><p>till I git my boot off. Ow! Wow!” </p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>7 </p><p> “Serves you right!” snapped Carlton.</p><p>“I ought to have finished you, you dirty </p><p>sneak!” He stood undecided for a moment, </p><p>swayed between humanity and inhumanity, </p><p>but generosity won. “Let me see that </p><p>leg. Humph. Flesh-wound. Too bad it </p><p>didn’t drill your head! Cut away those </p><p>dirty clothes and give it a wash. Lick it if </p><p>you have to. Now take my bandanna and </p><p>bind it. I ought to ram the thing down </p><p>your sneaking throat! Confound you, why </p><p>didn’t you fight like a man? Are you just </p><p>plain dog? What’s the idea in trying to </p><p>kill me, anyhow? Or are you just trying </p><p>to scare me out of the valley. Speak!” </p><p> Finch quit binding the red wound for a</p><p>second and looked up with the old expres- </p><p>sion of vague reproach and wonderment. </p><p> “You pizened them hosses!” came his</p><p>mournful, regretful answer. </p><p> “You lie!”</p><p> “’Tain’t fair,” whined Finch, ignoring</p><p>the outburst. “The first time, I let it pass. </p><p>‘Youth will have its fling/ sez I; so I let it </p><p>go. Next time, eight yearlin’s was found</p><p>daid; so I calc’lated I’d speak to you </p><p>friendly. You only told me to git off’n </p><p>your ranch.” This was with reproach un- </p><p>utterable. “ ’Twam’t neighborly. I let </p><p>that go at last, because I sez, ‘Time heals all </p><p>wounds,’ sez I. Then six four-year-olds </p><p>died las’ week, an’ las’ night ten mewls </p><p>went.” And he nodded his head sadly at </p><p>thought of his wrongs. </p><p> “You He!” blurted Carlton. “You lie!</p><p>I’m not poisoning horses!” </p><p> “You sez one day as haow you’d git water</p><p>ef you hed to clean out me an’ that stock,” </p><p>accused Finch most regretfully. “I was </p><p>right sorry. ’Peared that neighbors ought </p><p>to git along. I was right hurt about it. </p><p>Ouch!” The last was addressed to the </p><p>leg. </p><p> The monotonous insistence of that querul-</p><p>ous voice was beginning to get in its work. </p><p>Carlton somehow felt himself on the de- </p><p>fensive, and it maddened him. </p><p> “You sniveling old crook!” he growled.</p><p>“You know what’s the trouble as well as </p><p>I do!” </p><p> Finch shrugged a tired shoulder.</p><p> “I’m right sorry abaout that water,”</p><p>he sighed. “Seems jest like it’s only come </p><p>to make trouble between good neighbors. </p><p>Ef I could send that stock back, I’d do it, </p><p>but I hain’t got the money right naow. </p><p>I m right sorry.” He wagged a mournful </p><p>head, but his calculating little eyes rolled </p><p>up suddenly. “Mebbe you’d like to sell </p><p>your ranch back. Heh?” </p><p>5‘ NOTING the look of cupidity in </p><p>, that foxy face, Carlton reversed </p><p>I the pistol and weighed the butt </p><p>in his hand as if wondering how deeply </p><p>it could crash into that mournful, drooling, </p><p>crooked head. But he took it out in won- </p><p>dering. Finch seemed to keep the engi- </p><p>neer’s temper just at the border-line of </p><p>murder, but Carlton couldn't cross the line. </p><p>He was angered, perplexed and baffled. </p><p>At length, to save his own sanity, he gave </p><p>it up. </p><p> “Can you walk?” he snarled.</p><p> “I—I might make it,” said Finch, screw-</p><p>ing up his face dubiously. “My hoss is </p><p>right yonder on t’other side of that brown </p><p>rock.” </p><p> “Your getaway was well arranged,” ob-</p><p>served Carlton dryly. “Do you murder </p><p>many people in this way?” </p><p> “You pizened them hosses,” reiterated</p><p>Finch in the same regretful voice. “I was </p><p>right sorry abaout it, but-”</p><p> “Shut up!” screamed Carlton. “You</p><p>say one more word, and I’ll blow your head </p><p>off!” </p><p> Hypnotized though he was by that soft,</p><p>sighing voice, an overdose of it broke the </p><p>spell, and, now that he had cast off the </p><p>numbing influence, he resolved to keep the </p><p>upper hand. He knew he was just im- </p><p>pulsive enough to make good his threat, and </p><p>he sought an excuse. He longed for an excuse. </p><p>But it never came. And then Carlton </p><p>wondered what to do with the man. He </p><p>couldn’t shoot him in cold blood. He </p><p>couldn’t kick a wounded man down the </p><p>hill. He couldn’t keep him on the hilltop </p><p>all night, and he couldn’t take him home. </p><p>In a more civilized land he might have </p><p>Finch arrested, but that seemed out of the </p><p>question. </p><p> “Confound it!* puzzled the engineer.</p><p> Finch seemed about to speak. Carlton's</p><p>face showed a queer smile. Finch sensed </p><p>he was very near to eternity. He clamped </p><p>his jaw and looked away. Carlton teetered </p><p>on his toes and then made his decision. </p><p> “Stand up and hop!” ordered the engi-</p><p>neer. </p><p> Finch uncoiled his lanky frame and</p><p>hopped. Carlton helped him toward a </p><p>horse that whinnied from the shadow of a </p><p>8	Adventure</p><p>hot granite pillar, and half-shoved, half- </p><p>kicked him into the saddle, while Finch </p><p>yelped with pain. When the job was com- </p><p>pleted, Carlton, who had put the pistol into </p><p>its holster, produced it again. </p><p> “Travel!” he ordered sternly. “Git!</p><p>Vamose! And if you ever start anything </p><p>with me again, I’ll shoot on sight! Now </p><p>vanish!" </p><p> Finch shook his doleful head, gathered</p><p>the reins, clucked dismally and started </p><p>down the rocky hillside toward the green </p><p>valley below. Carlton stood and watched </p><p>until the figure was far down into the lower </p><p>reaches. A dozen clever and snappy re- </p><p>marks came to his head now, and yet in </p><p>Finch’s reproachful and nonresistant pres- </p><p>ence he knew his brain had bogged down as </p><p>usual—and now he had let the cold-blooded </p><p>old assassin go! The thought made him </p><p>angry with himself. </p><p> He turned his face away from the pitiless</p><p>glare of the setting sun and looked down </p><p>the eastern side of the ridge into his little </p><p>garden of Eden. The western country </p><p>was gaunt and godless, gray and yellow, </p><p>dancing in the blur of the purple heat-wave.</p><p>The valley was different. Pines clustered </p><p>in cool little groves under the side of the </p><p>copper mountain, and their tiny springs </p><p>gave verdure to the ground immediately </p><p>beneath him. </p><p> Far away the ranch-house and bams</p><p>and coops of Ebenezer Finch stood like </p><p>to^ placed on a carpet of green, with </p><p>yellow haystacks here and there and peace- </p><p>ful animals grazing. But somehow the </p><p>nearer lands at the lower end of the valley </p><p>looked yellower, as if lacking something. </p><p>A little verdant spot stood alongside </p><p>Carlton’s tiny white house, almost beneath </p><p>him, but that was from a trickling spring </p><p>used mostly for drinking-water. He con- </p><p>templated the place for a long time; then </p><p>he turned away. </p><p> “No water, little money and no friends</p><p>except one rip-snorting old saloon-keeper. </p><p>What am I going to do?” he asked of the </p><p>vast silence that seemed to mock him from </p><p>the treeless west. </p><p> He looked downward to the gaunt foot-</p><p>hills and their mystic purple ravines and </p><p>gulches, spread before him for miles, in- </p><p>hospitable and inscrutable, as if enchanted </p><p>by demons. This was the unmerciful </p><p>world outside the gates of his home, and </p><p>his fate seemed to be driving him toward it </p><p>He could not leave the country for good. </p><p>He knew his disease, even though he was </p><p>conquering it The doctors had specified </p><p>the desert for him. and the desert it must be. </p><p> It was only a question of happiness in</p><p>the valley of liis dreams or unhappiness </p><p>in the treeless, waterless plains below. </p><p>Standing on the mountain-top and looking </p><p>into the sinister western lands, tlie engineer </p><p>saw liis problem as plainly as if it were </p><p>written in two words: yes or no. </p><p> “No!" he resolved. "Never! If 1 have</p><p>to. I'll kill him! Thi^ is my home, and mine </p><p>she’ll stay!'’ </p><p> There was a new swing to Carlton’s</p><p>shoulders a&gt; he ambled down the mountain- </p><p>side later. He trudged toward the low- </p><p>lands and past a detached grove of pines, </p><p>whistling in spite of the heat The shad- </p><p>ows of late afternoon were dimming the </p><p>sunlight, and soon the air would l)e cooler. </p><p>Supper seemed to lje ready in the little </p><p>white-painted, two-story cottage. A wisp </p><p>of smoke curled from its chimney. </p><p> Suddenly the man noticed a flash of blue</p><p>and white coming around the corner of the </p><p>house and running toward him. The figure </p><p>seemed agitated. Slightly alarmed, he</p><p>gained speed until he vaulted the little </p><p>fence that bounded his truck-garden, where </p><p>his brown-eyed wife met him. </p><p> “Harry!” she cried, clutching at him.</p><p> “What’s the matter?”</p><p> “I don't know. What is it? The horse</p><p>galloped in a long time ago with an empty </p><p>saddle!” She was almost breathless, and </p><p>her eyes showed the strain she had under- </p><p>gone. “I thought of all sorts of horrible </p><p>things. Then Finch rode by with his leg </p><p>bound up. I called, but he wouldn’t stop; </p><p>so I stopped him.” </p><p> “How?”</p><p> Her eyes snapped sternly.</p><p> “I took down that rifle over the mantel</p><p>and pointed it at him!” </p><p> “Great Scott! What did he do?”</p><p> “Oh, he grinned like an old wolf and</p><p>put up his hands. He said. ‘You’re larnin’, </p><p>ma’am,’ and I said he would, too. Then he </p><p>said. ‘Birds of a feather flock together’ and </p><p>chuckled. I’d forgotten to cock the ham- </p><p>mer of the rifle; so I pulled it back with my </p><p>thumb. The gun nearly went off. It was </p><p>awful!” She took a long, shuddering </p><p>breath. “I asked him where you were, </p><p>and he said he didn’t know. He seemed </p><p>more polite. May be that clicking sound </p><p>4 </p><p>The Boss of Mirage	,	9</p><p>did it. He insisted he hadn't seen you; </p><p>so at last 1 had to let him go. He just left. </p><p>Then 1 really became worried.'' </p><p> The engineer’s brows were furrowed.</p><p> “What a liar he is!” he exclaimed irri-</p><p>tably. “It's like—like coping with an eeL </p><p>Did he say anything else—make any </p><p>threats?” </p><p> “N-no.” She seemed hesitant, as if</p><p>loath to alarm him. “He said something </p><p>about ‘widow’s weeds,’ but I didn’t quite </p><p>catch it. Nothing else much. His talk </p><p>seemed to be rambling. He said his best </p><p>horse died last night and a friend named </p><p>Jim Black was coming over to ‘dicker’ about </p><p>some land. He said Black had advised </p><p>him not to sell you the ranch but he took </p><p>a chance on you and now he’s sorry. That's </p><p>about ail, I guess.” </p><p> “All?” gasped Carlton.</p><p> The news made him wonder if the odds</p><p>against him were not too great. Black </p><p>had a reputation. </p><p>THE man belonged to the second </p><p>oldest profession in the world. </p><p>Back in the shadowy ages of an- </p><p>tiquity the kings of a legendary Egypt</p><p>employed his predecessors to do their </p><p>bidding. Cambyses, Claudius and Nero </p><p>used them lavishly. The Byzantine em- </p><p>perors posted them on every street corner, </p><p>and the age of the Borgias lifted their </p><p>craftsmanship almost into the arts. From </p><p>there they slowly declined in numbers and </p><p>power until today they are found only in </p><p>the toughest wards of the big cities or on </p><p>the last frontiers. </p><p> “Silent Jim” Black was a professional</p><p>killer. </p><p> This rough-and-ready section of the</p><p>country whispered about Black but could </p><p>prove nothing. He never harmed any one </p><p>except in self-defense, cleverly arranged. </p><p>He was not a fire-eater. It was not even </p><p>proven that he could be hired to kill. It </p><p>was only apparent that often, when two </p><p>men got into a quarrel, one of them was </p><p>likely to run against Jim Black. After the , </p><p>funeral Black seemed a mite more pros- </p><p>perous, but that might be coincidence. </p><p> The engineer’s wife felt there was some-</p><p>thing wrong. She read it in her husband's </p><p>face. </p><p> “What’s the matter?” she asked. “Is</p><p>Black a dangerous man?” </p><p> Carlton played the game and put his arm</p><p>about her. He had no intention of causing </p><p>alarm. Things were bad enough as they </p><p>were. </p><p> “Oh, no,” he reassured her. “Black is</p><p>one of the most suave and courteous per- </p><p>sons in the country’.” </p><p> “But what is he doing with Finch?”</p><p> “I don’t know. Maybe I'll find out,”</p><p>he replied with hidden sarcasm. “Never </p><p>mind that. Let’s get supper.” </p><p> The wife sensed there was some cruel</p><p>play going on around her, but her Eastern- </p><p>trained mind could not gage it. Later, as </p><p>the days passed, the mystery' became a </p><p>torment, equal to the question of the </p><p>poisoned horses. Her husband daily </p><p>seemed more nervous and worried. Once, </p><p>when Finch happened by, Carlton hurried </p><p>inside and stood by his rifle. Again, when </p><p>Finch and a black-clad stranger rode about </p><p>the former’s ranch, the engineer lay under </p><p>a pine tree and with field-glasses watched </p><p>them until the tour was over. </p><p> Later, when the dark stranger rode by</p><p>alone and tossed a casual nod toward the </p><p>house, Carlton’s face went white, and he </p><p>kept his hand near a holster behind the </p><p>doorway. When Jim Black failed to make </p><p>the slightest hostile sign, the engineer felt</p><p>like a fool. </p><p> That episode made things worse. At</p><p>times Carlton wondered if he were not a </p><p>mite too scary. The engineer did not know </p><p>what to think; so he puzzled and worried </p><p>until at length the strain and irritation </p><p>began to tell on him. Then his wife caught </p><p>the infection. </p><p> To cap the climax, Ebenezer Finch began</p><p>to resume his visits when Carlton w^as too </p><p>far afield to forestall him. First he came </p><p>to “borry” something, just as if nothing </p><p>had happened. Later he called to bewail </p><p>the loss of a prime w'hite mare and twelve </p><p>mules by poison. The visits kept the </p><p>young woman exasperated and nervous, </p><p>though she felt that was what he aimed for. </p><p>It looked like part of his campaign of terror- </p><p>ism. She sensed that his evasive, whining, </p><p>wiseacre speech covered something sinister </p><p>and that he was watching, watching like a </p><p>coiled snake biding its time to strike. </p><p> “I can’t stand it any longer!” she blurted</p><p>one October evening when she and Carlton </p><p>were seated on the steps of their narrow </p><p>little porch. </p><p> "I know,” nodded the engineer, as he</p><p>puffed at his forbidden pipe and watched </p><p>IO </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the fading sunlight weave its red brocades </p><p>over the copper mountain. “Neither </p><p>can I” </p><p> “And yet,” she hesitated, “it’s glorious.”</p><p>She sniffed the cooling October air, scented </p><p>from the pines and the dry grass and the </p><p>near-by rose-bushes. “Finch offered eight </p><p>hundred dollars for the land,” she con- </p><p>cluded paradoxically. “Then he offered </p><p>a little more.” </p><p> “It cost us eight thousand," he stated.</p><p>“Would you like to give it up?” </p><p> “No. And yet—can we stay?”</p><p> He took the pipe from his mouth and</p><p>seemed to be watching a humming-bird </p><p>as it studied a new honeysuckle vine. </p><p> “Maybe not,” he admitted. “If it</p><p>wasn’t for the confounded mysteries, maybe </p><p>we could. Who’s been poisoning those </p><p>horses?” </p><p> “Perhaps they were not poisoned at all.”</p><p>“They were! I’ve seen the dead ani- </p><p>mals.” </p><p> “Well, then they were” she sighed. “I</p><p>give it up. What can we do about it?” </p><p>“I’ve got a plan. I’ve been thinking it </p><p>over. We’ll go to town for a while. I’ll </p><p>come and farm the place at odd times and</p><p>hire a few huskies to relieve me in guarding </p><p>it.” The engineer was really contemplating </p><p>an offensive wrar, but of this he said nothing. </p><p>“In that way,” he explained, “we can run </p><p>the ranch and get away from this mystery.” </p><p>“For how long? Have we money </p><p>enough?” </p><p> “I guess so. Maybe I can do a little land-</p><p>surveying outside. Anyhow, the change </p><p>will do us good. How about it?” </p><p> •“But how can we leave with Finch</p><p>watching us?” </p><p> “That’s easy. We’ll get things packed</p><p>quietly and wait till he starts out some </p><p>morning for supplies. He’ll leave Abe </p><p>Bilger, that half-witted hired man of his, </p><p>to guard the place. We’ll let him get well </p><p>started, and then wTe’ll follow on.” </p><p> They discussed it all evening, measuring</p><p>things from every angle, but they had </p><p>decided beforehand. They had come to </p><p>realize that their single-handed battle was </p><p>a little too much for them at present. </p><p>They needed a respite. Thus it happened </p><p>that next day the wife got things in order, </p><p>and then they awaited the passing of </p><p>Finch. Black had disappeared from the </p><p>scene and almost from their minds. </p><p> Two weeks later Finch went by with</p><p>empty saddle-bags and grain-sacks dangling </p><p>from his horse’s sides. He saw' the glint of </p><p>Carlton’s ready gun and kept at a respectful </p><p>distance. AJter he left the valley, the </p><p>engineer cautiously mounted the ridge to </p><p>make sure it was not some ruse, but Finch </p><p>kept on, past cliffs and foot-hills, till at </p><p>length his dust faded in the far white dis- </p><p>tance of the alkaline plains. Then Carlton </p><p>descended to his home. </p><p> “It’s after nine o’clock,” he announced.</p><p>“Let’s hurry.” </p><p> They took two saddle-horses and a pack-</p><p>inule, loading them carefully. They did </p><p>not want their departure to appear per- </p><p>manent. Then, with everything ready, </p><p>they trotted down the little lane and toward </p><p>the pass that led out of their valley of </p><p>dreams. </p><p> Once, at the gap, they halted for a mo-</p><p>ment, and the wife looked back, wondering </p><p>if it were for the last time. The gentle </p><p>October sunlight glorified fields, pine- </p><p>groves, oaks and w-iilows, and the cool </p><p>breeze brought the gracious scent of pine </p><p>to their nostrils, while the old copper moun- </p><p>tain gave them benediction from above. </p><p>A meadow-lark sang them a little song. A </p><p>bee hummed by. The girl’s eyes moistened</p><p>from a queer homesickness, but she turned </p><p>her horse resolutely and started onward. </p><p>in </p><p>THEY arrived at the settlement </p><p>before dusk, meeting only a few </p><p>cattlemen or prospectors on the way. </p><p>Carlton took his wife to the ramshackle </p><p>hotel for the time and then sw'ung past </p><p>the seven saloons of the “street” to where </p><p>the porch of Dolan’s dance-hall and general </p><p>merchandise store jutted into a turn of the </p><p>road. </p><p> A pianist was practising for the evening's</p><p>noise, and the quavery banging floated out </p><p>of many windows, past the dozen loungers </p><p>squatted on the wide porch or leaning </p><p>against hitching-posts as they performed </p><p>their evening (ask of watching the darkness </p><p>arrive. Inside another dozen was gathered </p><p>about the bar near the wide door. Dolan’s </p><p>heavy bass voice floated out, giving direc- </p><p>tions about trimming the lamps. WTien </p><p>Carlton ambled in, Dolan, in shirt-sleeves </p><p>as usual, dropped a rag and grabbed his </p><p>hand. </p><p>“Well!” he roared. “You still on earth? </p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>How goes it?” He pulled Carlton forward </p><p>as if he were a doll. “Come back to a table </p><p>and have a drink. Not drinkin’ today, </p><p>hey? Well, have a drink anyhow!” And </p><p>with great gusto he yanked the engineer </p><p>toward a seat near a window in the rear </p><p>room, while the hangers-on laughed. </p><p> Dolan’s attitude changed when he had</p><p>Carlton seated in the corner. He muffled </p><p>his voice somew’hat. </p><p> “You darned fool!” he rasped. “What</p><p>did you come here for?” - </p><p>“Why? What’s the matter?” </p><p> “Matter? Huh—if Jim Black sees you—</p><p>good night! He’s after you!” </p><p>The engineer felt his heart thump </p><p>strange])-. He pondered a moment; then: </p><p>“Why should he be seeking me now?” </p><p>“He needs money. He gits it from </p><p>Fitch—provided. See?” </p><p> “Provided!” gulped Carlton. “Provided</p><p>he does the work, that is. I see.” He </p><p>stopped and tried to figure it all out. </p><p>“Then, if I go, Black gets the ranch. I see. </p><p>That’s about what Finch hinted one day </p><p>when he met my wife.” </p><p> “Then he lied as usual,” contradicted</p><p>Dolan. </p><p> “How?”</p><p> “Huh. Think Finch wants Black for</p><p>a neighbor? Nix. Not. Ncin! Too dan-</p><p>gerous! Black gits cash!” </p><p> The more Carlton studied the transaction,</p><p>the less natural it seemed. That sort of </p><p>business might be all right for the old Lhugs </p><p>of India or the mandarins of China, but the </p><p>thought of paid assassination in the civilized </p><p>year of 1903 in the State of California </p><p>seemed like a strain on the imagination. </p><p>Though Dolan’s bailiwick w'as in the wildest </p><p>and most lawless section of a go-as-you- </p><p>please county, it took only three days to </p><p>reach the railroad, and then the big modem </p><p>cities were in easy reach. Even here </p><p>their influence was felt. Dolan was </p><p>thinking of installing a telephone! </p><p> “It’s nonsense!” blurted the engineer.</p><p>“It’s a plot to scare me out!1’ </p><p> Carlton looked at the saloon-keeper</p><p>queerly for an instant. Dolan had tried </p><p>to alarm him. Might it be—could it be— </p><p>that Dolan was also in the plot? Anything </p><p>seemed possible. Did this saloon-keeper </p><p>size him up for a tenderfoot after all—just </p><p>another “sucker” to be trimmed? Carlton </p><p>was not naturally suspicious, but he </p><p>was not wholly well yet, and of late he </p><p>had been filled with many perplexities. </p><p> “Sure, it's a plot,” said Dolan tiredly.</p><p>“If they skeer you out, so much the better. </p><p>If not, you git out anyhow. See? That's </p><p>where Black comes in. Finch means busi- </p><p>ness. You hit him with a rail. His hosses </p><p>are pizened. You shot hira, I hear. He's </p><p>mad. Before that it wasn't personal. </p><p>You was only another sucker. Now it's </p><p>pers’nal. See?” </p><p> “But,” argued Carlton, “Black was in the</p><p>valley several times. He didn’t start any- </p><p>thing.” </p><p> “Why should he? No witnesses there.</p><p>He couldn't prove self-defense. Your wife </p><p>was always around. It has to be public. </p><p>See?” </p><p> The engineer found his throat welling</p><p>and his lingers drumming on the table </p><p>nervously. The lamps of the dance-hall </p><p>were being hung, but he only saw them as </p><p>glassy blurs. He knew his face was white, </p><p>but he was able to meet Dolan's shrewd </p><p>gaze unflinchingly. There wras even de- </p><p>fiance in his eyes. The big man nodded. </p><p> “Are—are you sure of all this?” insisted</p><p>the groping Carlton. </p><p> “Certain. Finch came in several weeks</p><p>ago. Drank too much of Looey Bums’ </p><p>snake-juice.” Dolan jerked his finger in </p><p>the direction of a rival sin-palace. “He </p><p>told Looey about his friend Black. Said</p><p>Black wras likely to git somebody soon. </p><p>Said it was all fixed. Said thereVI be one </p><p>less pest in Lost Deet Valley- That meant </p><p>you. Then he went to sleep under a table. </p><p>Forgot all about it. Looev told me next </p><p>evenin’. Perfesh'nul courtesy between sa- </p><p>loon-owners. Yes, I said courtesy. We </p><p>have to keep, tabs on people. A man's </p><p>credit may be no good. If he hangs around </p><p>too long, he’ll bust you. It’s business.” </p><p> Carlton began to see into things he had</p><p>never dreamed of. He had stumbled upon </p><p>a regular, coordinated information-bureau! </p><p> “Then who has been poisoning Finch’s</p><p>horses?” he demanded. </p><p> “I don’t know,” admitted Dolan. “I</p><p>got my suspicions, but I ain’t sure yet. </p><p>Why the devil didn’t you stay away and </p><p>gimme time to w-ork things "out?” The </p><p>boss scratched his head. “Now Finch is </p><p>in town. Black’s here. You’re here. It’s </p><p>all mixed up. The devil only knows how </p><p>it’s cornin’ out!” </p><p> “Well,” announced Carlton, “I'm not</p><p>going to run, anyhow.” </p><p>12 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “No; only, lay low. No use to look for</p><p>trouble. Black’s deadly. Lay low'.” </p><p> With this kindly admonition the giant</p><p>started to get up and go about his business, </p><p>but something in Carlton’s face arrested </p><p>him. The engineer, two shades paler, w'as </p><p>looking at something far past the boss. </p><p>Dolan turned and peered around. </p><p>BEYOND the loafers at the bar, </p><p>beyond the wide doorway, beyond </p><p>the hitching-posts and the dusty </p><p>roadway, tlie dark, immaculate figure of </p><p>Jim Black was seen passing a small knot </p><p>of men and ambling toward Dolan's door. </p><p>He stopped and nodded to some one; then </p><p>he sauntered onward. Carlton had hold of </p><p>his chair and was staring as if fascinated. </p><p> “Lay low!” advised Dolan. “Sit tight!</p><p>It might not come now anyhow.” </p><p> But Carlton’s jaw was set at last, and he</p><p>started to arise. He had come to the end </p><p>of the road. The long siege of w'orry and </p><p>doubt and fear and nervous tension had </p><p>caused something to snap within him, and, </p><p>though his teeth were chattering, he had </p><p>cast the die. He was afraid—scared blue— </p><p>but going forward. The eyes of the tough </p><p>old boss showed an admiring glint, and he </p><p>resolved to save this man from the results </p><p>of his own stubborn courage. </p><p> “Sit down!” ordered Dolan.</p><p> “I won’t!”</p><p> “You will!” snapped the boss, laying a</p><p>mighty hand on his shoulder. “Nix on </p><p>this hero stuff! Lay low!” </p><p> Carlton’s eyes were suddenly hard and</p><p>cold. </p><p> “Let go of me!” he demanded. “Get</p><p>out of my way!”	*</p><p> The boss hesitated only for an instant.</p><p>Then he grabbed the engineers right arm </p><p>and twisted it as if in a vise. </p><p> “Don’t speak to me like that!” he snarled.</p><p>“Who do you think you are? Come on, </p><p>you! You’re goin’ into that linen-closet!” </p><p>And he grabbed Carl ton by the scruff of his </p><p>neck. </p><p> “What?” exploded the outraged engineer,</p><p>savagely angry at last. “Why, you -” </p><p> “Shut up!” roared the saloon-keeper.</p><p>Suddenly the crowd outside the front </p><p>door jumped. They scattered pell-mell. </p><p>Two men, in the semigloom, rushed around </p><p>an outside corner and cowered behind the </p><p>w'all of the building. Another yelled and </p><p>got behind a hitching-post. Sudden shouts </p><p>and the scuffle of feet told of an instan- </p><p>taneous crisis outside. People were rush- </p><p>ing to get out of line from something. </p><p>Dolan knew the symptoms and halted, un- </p><p>decided. </p><p> A pistol cracked outside the window that</p><p>faced the side road. A piercing cry was </p><p>heard—then another shot. Then silence— </p><p>the queer, deathly silence that follows a </p><p>tragedy. </p><p> The bystanders started running forward,</p><p>away from the saloon. Dolan rushed to the </p><p>side window', drawing Carlton with him. </p><p>The boss peered out to the roadway. In </p><p>front of an old blacksmith-shop opposite, </p><p>a prone figure was King, face forward, </p><p>wiUi arms outstretched grotesquely. An- </p><p>other figure was sitting near by, sagging </p><p>forward and nursing a shoulder. Men </p><p>came running up from every direction. </p><p> “It’s done!” grunted Dolan, releasing</p><p>the engineer. </p><p> “What is?”</p><p> The old boss pointed a pudgy finger to-</p><p>ward the prone figure. </p><p> “Know who that is?” he asked.</p><p> The engineer looked closer.</p><p> “It’s Ebenezer Finch!” he cried, almost</p><p>unbelieving. </p><p> “Right. Finch it is. Died game, any-</p><p>how. He shot back. Cornered, I guess. </p><p>Had to be game. Know the other feller?” </p><p> The bewildered engineer looked long and</p><p>hard. He had seen that middle-sized fig- </p><p>ure somew'here but couldn’t quite place </p><p>him. </p><p> “That’s Tom Fulton,” announced the</p><p>boss. </p><p> “Fulton. Fulton? You mean the man</p><p>that used to own my ranch? Never met </p><p>liim. And yet he seems familiar, at that.” </p><p> Jim Black w'as lifting the suffering man,</p><p>but Black w'as an afterthought. </p><p> “Sure you seen Fulton!” boomed Dolan’s</p><p>voice. “Remember the day you was here </p><p>last? ’Member the coot that came in </p><p>full of licker? Wanted to lick all creation? </p><p>Got thrown out? That wras Fulton.” </p><p> Carlton began to grope. There was</p><p>something underneath it all, but he could </p><p>not grasp it. Dolan suddenly appeared as </p><p>satisfied as a cat full of cream. </p><p> ‘‘This here tragedy cost me about twenty</p><p>dollars,” announced the big saloon-keeper </p><p>quite casually. </p><p> Carlton became even more befuddled.</p><p> “Twenty? How?” he asked.</p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>13 </p><p> “Keepin’ Fulton full of Dutch courage,”</p><p>replied the amiable old thug. “He used </p><p>to own your ranch. Got froze out like you. </p><p>Woke up too late. Swore he'd kill Finch. </p><p>Didn’t make good. Got sick, went broke </p><p>and drifted away. I forgot all about it. </p><p>He ' didn’t. Came back here after five </p><p>years. Worked up his courage with licker. </p><p>Tried to git himself up to the killin’-point. </p><p>Got too noisy, and I threw him out. </p><p> “Then you reminded me who he was.</p><p>You told me who’d owned your ranch </p><p>before you. You mentioned Tom Fulton. </p><p>Then I knew him. After you left, I went </p><p>after him. I sort of have it in for Finch </p><p>myself. Fulton told me all his troubles. </p><p>Got sympathy. Also licker. Buckets of </p><p>it. Got more courage every day&lt; Waited </p><p>for Finch. Finch arrived today. Funeral </p><p>tomorrow.” </p><p>IV </p><p>IT WAS terse and to the point, but </p><p>Carlton felt his hair curling. This </p><p>broad-shouldered, black-haired giant </p><p>in front of him had arranged a killing </p><p>as casually as he would prepare a fishing </p><p>excursion. He even furnished the bait! </p><p>The engineer found himself dizzy. </p><p> The old boss read his thoughts.</p><p> “For the public good,” he grunted.</p><p>“Finch was a pest. Always in trouble. </p><p>Always snivelin’. Always cheatin’. I’ve</p><p>been waitin' for some one to put him out. </p><p>Now I’m glad he’s gone.” </p><p> So was Carlton, in a way, but his soul</p><p>had not yet risen to such heights of altruis- </p><p>tic manslaughter, and the chills were running </p><p>down his spine. He was brave enough, but </p><p>this was different He changed the subject </p><p>abruptly. </p><p> “Then maybe Fulton poisoned those</p><p>horses,” he surmised. </p><p> "Mebbe. He went away mysterious</p><p>several times. He promised to do some- </p><p>thin' desp’rate. That’s about his size— </p><p>pizenin’ dumb animals. Mebbe, if I wanted </p><p>proof, I could git it, but—what’s the use? </p><p>I don’t care a hoot either way.” </p><p> There was a wealth of scorn in Dolan’s</p><p>voice in commenting upon his tool, and the </p><p>the engineer realized how masterfully the </p><p>drunkard had been managed. While 'Carl- </p><p>ton was away in his valley, a little drama </p><p>had been staged in this rough pine-board </p><p>colony, with John Barleycorn as a prime </p><p>actor and himself as beneficiary—and Do- </p><p>lan as stage-manager. Carlton realized </p><p>that the big boss had mainly told him </p><p>the truth. He had supplied the shooting </p><p>because he despised Finch naturally, be- </p><p>cause of the general public good, because he </p><p>wanted to see a fight and partially because </p><p>of Carlton. Then another thought crossed </p><p>the engineer’s mind. </p><p> “By the way,” he asked, “how about Jim</p><p>Black? What is he going to do?” </p><p> Dolan’s reply was prompt.</p><p> “Nothin’. Why should he? Finch is</p><p>dead. The deal’s off. This shootin’ leaves </p><p>Black up in the air. Nothin’ in it for him, </p><p>is there? He’s got nothin’ against you </p><p>personal, has he?” </p><p> “It sounds reasonable,” conceded the</p><p>engineer. </p><p> Here in the dusk, with the last faint</p><p>traces of red in the western sky, it seemed </p><p>that a great burden was lifted off his shoul- </p><p>ders, even though he did not exactly ap- </p><p>prove of the method. He felt that his life </p><p>seemed clear from now on and he could </p><p>live forever with his bride in the valley of </p><p>his heart’s delight, with the old copper </p><p>mountain giving them benediction to the </p><p>end. With his heart swelling, the engineer </p><p>turned away from the wrinkled face of the </p><p>sordid, crafty, loyal old thug who had </p><p>befriended him. He absently looked out- </p><p>side to where groups of men stood about </p><p>the actors in the pitiful tragedy. And then </p><p>his dreams vanished.</p><p> The crowd in front of Finch had thinned</p><p>slightly, and the glimmer of a lantern </p><p>showed his head being raised on Jim </p><p>Black’s knee while another man was </p><p>sponging his hair, where a dark stream was </p><p>flowing from above the ear. </p><p> Finch’s face was almost demoniac as the</p><p>lantern cast its lights and shadows upon the </p><p>sharp features, and from his mouth there </p><p>issued a volley of profanity that seemed to </p><p>flicker the light with its blasts. Nearer, </p><p>another group was putting Tom Fulton on </p><p>a shutter, lifting him with rough tenderness. </p><p>Beyond the groups of men, lights from </p><p>Looey’s place and the other saloons down </p><p>the street gave vague illumination to the </p><p>roadway, while the music of a tinny piano </p><p>jangled from one of them, playing a “coon </p><p>song’ as if nothing had "happened. But </p><p>above all came that high-pitched jabber </p><p>of Ebenezer Finch, very much alive. It </p><p>was not soft and regretful now; it was </p><p>Adventure </p><p>explosive. Among other thing’s it shrieked </p><p>“Gimme my gun!'' and “Lemme at him!” </p><p>“No!” came Uie voice of Jim Black dur- </p><p>ing a silence. “Stop that! Wait till you </p><p>get ’tended to!” </p><p> A murmur of voices followed, broken by</p><p>another shrieking volley of wildcat profanity, </p><p>but the writhing form of the wounded </p><p>Tom Fulton had been carried out of sight, </p><p>and Finch had not seen him. </p><p> Carlton, noting with interest tfiat Finch</p><p>had taken on another i'eud, felt queerly like </p><p>a front-seat spectator in a show arranged </p><p>for his benefit as he looked out of the win- </p><p>dow. Dolan, standing alongside him, </p><p>seemed angry. </p><p> “-!” boomed the heavy voice of the</p><p>boss at length in infinite disgust. “Rotten </p><p>job! Rotten!” And that was all he could </p><p>say. </p><p> A prospector came through the talking</p><p>crowd at Dolan’s doorway and approached </p><p>the boss, bringing news. </p><p> “Didja see it?” he chirped. “A fella</p><p>named Fulton met old Finch in the road- </p><p>way and cussed him out. He ’peared to be </p><p>drunk. He reached for his gun, an’ so did </p><p>Finch. Finch shot him in the shoulder, </p><p>an’ he shot Finch in the head. They was </p><p>so close they jest couldn’t miss!” </p><p> “Huh. What was the trouble?” asked</p><p>Dolan innocently. </p><p> The prospector’s face looked perplexed.</p><p>trDarned if I know',” he answered. “Mebbe </p><p>it’s some one that Finch skinned.”</p><p> “How?” asked the boss.</p><p> “I don’t know,” answered the puzzled</p><p>prospector. “Somethin’ was said about a </p><p>ranch, but that was all I got.” </p><p> The desert-rat seemed aggrieved about it.</p><p>After a long, lonely trip through unlimited </p><p>wastes, where he and his burro had probably </p><p>suffered all sorts of hardships, he had </p><p>witnessed a bang-up fight and didn’t un- </p><p>derstand all about the matter, thus feeling </p><p>deprived of something. He did not know </p><p>Fulton. Few did. The male population </p><p>drifted in and out continually—and five </p><p>years is a long time. Men did not generally </p><p>know each other very well in this country'. ’ </p><p>“Is Finch hurt bad?” asked the boss." </p><p> “I dunno. Somebody went after Doc</p><p>Davis, and mebbe we’ll see. There’s the </p><p>old doc now.” And the prospector ran </p><p>away to keep tab on the latest develop- </p><p>ments. </p><p> A stocky man with a warty face and a</p><p>bulbous nose ambled gravely toward the </p><p>recumbent Finch. The crowd made way </p><p>for him as, with gestures of professional </p><p>interest, the elderly arrival examined the </p><p>wound and gave a few terse directions to </p><p>the bystanders. Dan Dolan chuckled. </p><p> “It’s all right now. Doc Davis has got</p><p>the case. Finch’ll die.” </p><p> The engineer looked nonplussed.</p><p>“Hoss-doctor,” explained Dolan. “Good </p><p>man once, but went wrong. Came from </p><p>New York. Had troubles. Drowned ’em. </p><p>Been drownin’ ’em ever since. If Finch is </p><p>hurt bad, he’ll die.” </p><p>SOMEHOW Carlton could not fall </p><p>into this mood. Dolan might hate </p><p>like that, but the engineer couldn'L </p><p>The engineer failed to realize that Dolan </p><p>looked on Finch as one might look on a </p><p>snake or any other pest which one did not </p><p>hate but simply struck on general principles. </p><p>Without realizing it fully, Dolan, busy with </p><p>engrossing business and political" fights, </p><p>had despised the old hypocrite for years but </p><p>never thought much about it until a man </p><p>he liked became a victim. Now he was </p><p>taking notice with a vengeance. </p><p> “If Davis is loaded enough, he’ll operate,”</p><p>added the boss. “That’s him. If he’s </p><p>sober, he lets the patient alone. Patient </p><p>recovers. If he’s full, he wants to show off. </p><p>Tackles anything. He’d operate on the </p><p>Angel Gabriel!” And Dolan’s calculating </p><p>gaze went to the bottles stacked behind his </p><p>busy bar. </p><p> “Don’t!” advised Carlton. “Isn’t there</p><p>any other doctor around here?” </p><p> Dolan looked a little disappointed at this</p><p>squeamishness. </p><p> “Nope,” he replied tersely. “There’s</p><p>three at the county-seat. None here but </p><p>Davis. No use to bring in another doctor. </p><p>Finch ain’t worth it.” </p><p> The engineer felt properly rebuked.</p><p>“Well,” he decided cautiously, “anyhow, </p><p>maybe it’s best to be neutral Let ’em </p><p>alone. Let Davis kill or cure. That </p><p>makes it a sporting proposition.” </p><p> Carlton calculated that the sporting ele-</p><p>ment would appeal to Dolan, and it did. </p><p> “Fair enough,” acceded the boss. “I’ll</p><p>bet you ten he dies.” </p><p> “Done!”</p><p> A glance through the window showed</p><p>that Finch had been carried somewhere out </p><p>of sight. The side street was deserted </p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>15 </p><p>again except for its tethered horses and the </p><p>jangle of piano music. It was just as if </p><p>nothing had happened. Dolan and Carlton </p><p>ambled toward the front of the place, get- </p><p>ting out of the way for the dance about to </p><p>start. A few tired-looking girls had ap- </p><p>peared long before and mingled with the </p><p>crowd of prospectors, miners, ranchers and </p><p>cattlemen from every part of the hills. A </p><p>piano, a fiddle and a bass-drum had been </p><p>tuning up. The board walls were beginning </p><p>to rattle at the noise, and pictures of ac- </p><p>tresses, culled from the sporting journals, </p><p>were vibrating. </p><p> The portly Doctor Davis came in at</p><p>length, strutting importantly at the head of </p><p>a retinue. Dolan’s practised eye estimated </p><p>he was half-sober, wliile those at the bar </p><p>plied the medical man with questions. </p><p> “All he needs is a little time and nursing,”</p><p>announced the professional man. , ‘‘The </p><p>bullet struck the temporal bone, went along </p><p>the screamous portion, glanced off the more </p><p>peetreus tracts and avoided the mastoid, </p><p>making a welt, a track or what might be </p><p>called a crease. Except for possible con- </p><p>cussion, gen’lemen, I doubt that any ma- </p><p>terial complications can occur. He is rest- </p><p>ing easy at the hotel.” </p><p> Ed Hendry, from the Willow Creek</p><p>country, leaned his tall frame against the </p><p>bar and voiced his curiosity loudl)'. </p><p> “What made him yell like a wildcat when</p><p>he came to?” </p><p> “Delirum,” responded the doctor courte-</p><p>ously. “Perfectly natural. Any one gets</p><p>twisted around after a blow like that. </p><p>Why, one-half an inch more and he’d have </p><p>been dead!” </p><p>“Huh. That’s the first time Finch ever </p><p>let himself out!*’ commented the rancher. </p><p>“He usu’lly snivels. Did he git over it?” </p><p>“He’s calmed down now,” admitted the </p><p>doctor. “Friend of yours?” </p><p> “No!” snapped Hendry.</p><p> “Ah,” said the horse-doctor, changing the</p><p>subject tactfully. “Bartender, set ’em up. </p><p>Your pleasure, gen’lemen, every one!” </p><p> But Dan Dolan was loyal to his bet.</p><p>“No!” he countermanded. “No drinks </p><p>for the doc! Everybody but the doctor!” </p><p>The crowd turned. The insulted veter- </p><p>inarian sputtered. </p><p> “Why?” he demanded.</p><p> “No drinks till Finch is out of danger!”</p><p>Hendry, the Willow Creek rancher, </p><p>turned around and faced Dolan. </p><p> “Is Finch a friend of yours?” he inter-</p><p>posed very quietly. </p><p> The boss bristled.</p><p> “What’s it to you?”</p><p> The rancher’s face whitened, but he faced</p><p>Dolan without flinching. </p><p> “Then you’re through!” he flared. “I</p><p>knew Finch in Escalante. If you’re a </p><p>friend of his, you’re a low-down, sneakin’, </p><p>lyin’, hoss-stealin’ skunk that a decent </p><p>rattlesnake wouldn’t be seen in company </p><p>with! Why, you-” </p><p> The boss could not hesitate before an</p><p>audience like this. It was a matter of </p><p>prestige, decided instantly. The mighty </p><p>fist of Dan Dolan crashed into Hendry’s </p><p>face and whirled him backward into the </p><p>horse-doctor. The smack sounded like an </p><p>ax hitting a tree. The rancher and the </p><p>mcdical man rolled to the sawdust together. </p><p> The crowd parted as if by magic. Dolan</p><p>stood alone, fist clenched, facing the prone </p><p>man. Two other Willow Creek men sidled </p><p>in, facing Dolan wrathfully. </p><p> “Want some, too?” roared the boss.</p><p> One of them grabbed his arm. He did</p><p>not argue. He shoved the man aside. </p><p>The other reached downward toward his </p><p>belt. Quick as light, the giant rushed him </p><p>and planted a pole-ax blow into his face. </p><p>That man also fell to the floor. </p><p> Some one yelled. The place became tu-</p><p>multuous. Carlton edged toward the boss </p><p>loyally, but Dolan needed no help. He </p><p>stooped over quickly and disarmed the man </p><p>who had reached downward. Then he </p><p>stood up with a gleaming six-shooter in</p><p>his hand. </p><p> “Any one else want in?” he roared, look-</p><p>ing around truculently. </p><p> No one volunteered. Some of the crowd</p><p>even drew back. The boss, satisfied, </p><p>walked over to the first man he had struck. </p><p>Ed Hendry of Willow Creek was just com- </p><p>ing to. The horse-doctor was fanning him. </p><p> “Here!” said the boss, pulling Hendry to</p><p>his feet “Git out!” </p><p> He led the unresisting man to the door</p><p>and gave him a gentle shove. Then he re- </p><p>turned and picked up the second victim, </p><p>shook him a bit and helped him to the </p><p>door also. It had all happened within a </p><p>minute. </p><p> “All right!” cried the boss, waving his</p><p>hand to the crowd in the dance-halL </p><p>“Track’s clear! On with the dance! Strike </p><p>up the music!” </p><p>i6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The “music” obeyed with great alacrity.</p><p> Carlton had been a silent bystander, and</p><p>in a way he wondered what this giant might </p><p>do next. When the boss approached, he </p><p>was in a thundering black mood. His first </p><p>remark was wrathful but utterly unex- </p><p>pected.	m ^</p><p> “Now I’m ag’in Finch for fair!” he an-</p><p>nounced, “’Tain’t your light alone now. </p><p>It’s mine!” </p><p> Carlton was thunderstruck at this atti-</p><p>tude. </p><p> “How?” he blurted.</p><p> “Huh. Finch started all Lhe trouble in</p><p>the first place, didn’t he?” </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Well, now he's lost me three good cus-</p><p>tomers!” </p><p>V </p><p> HARRY CARLTON did not sleep</p><p>very well that night. His experien- </p><p>^ -* ces had brought him into a depres- </p><p>sive mood. It was not that he had lost out. </p><p>It was not that he lacked loyal backing. It </p><p>was because of his environment and the </p><p>sordidness of it and a species of homesick- </p><p>ness that had come over him. Carlton did </p><p>not feel above his fellows, but they were </p><p>different so that the roughness and harsh- </p><p>ness of this land and its people made him </p><p>wonder if it were worth while to continue </p><p>among them, even though his conquered </p><p>disease demanded it. </p><p> The town was a hole-in-the-mud place.</p><p>The highest ideal of most of its inhabitants </p><p>was to win enough money at gambling to</p><p>keep cold drunk. The town was called </p><p>Mirage. Apt name! It was illusory, un- </p><p>stable, unreliable. A1 though it had lived </p><p>forty years, it still had the unpainted, un- </p><p>kempt appearance of a camp that might </p><p>blow away any minute and was not worth </p><p>improving. </p><p> And Carlton was most worried about his</p><p>wife. Now that he had her in town, what </p><p>could he do with her? For the present they </p><p>had taken quarters at the hotel, made from </p><p>a defunct dance-hall, where thin board* </p><p>partitions had been nailed to make “rooms.” </p><p>For her there were no women to associate </p><p>with, no amusement, no little conveniences. </p><p>The hotel was used mainly by drunks </p><p>sleeping off their sprees. The place was </p><p>sordid and makeshift and depressing. The </p><p>whole atmosphere of the town, for a fine </p><p>young Eastern girl, was impossible—im- </p><p>possible! </p><p> hi the sunlight of the next day it seemed</p><p>even worse. The signs on the cheap board </p><p>fronts of the cheap board saloons and the </p><p>Chinese restaurant and the old red black- </p><p>smith shop were half obliterated by the hot </p><p>suns of forty years. Dolan’s place, with </p><p>the windows unwashed and fly-specked, </p><p>looked dilapidated and sodden and cheer- </p><p>less. Beyond the turn of the road at Do- </p><p>lan's the hot, treeless spurs of gaunt moun- </p><p>tains sloped down into unlimited wastes of </p><p>hot, treeless, waterless plains that seemed </p><p>to stretch on forever. Carlton began to </p><p>curse the folly and the illusions that brought </p><p>him into this country'. </p><p> Although the engineer did not know it,</p><p>he was suffering the maladies that come to </p><p>every secondary pioneer. The first pioneers </p><p>had come to this land and given their </p><p>natural wildness full sway, turning it into </p><p>a free-for-all hell and ignoring its possibili- </p><p>ties. Had Carlton understood, he might, </p><p>like the far-seeing Dolan, have visioned </p><p>himself clearly as among the first of the new </p><p>pioneers in this corner of the county—the </p><p>earnest, decent settlers who within ten </p><p>years were to transform the old West into </p><p>the new West and make it a land of pros- </p><p>perous homes, schools, auto roads, giant </p><p>irrigation systems and clean little towns. </p><p> Carlton could not peer ahead and see the</p><p>great dam with which the Government was </p><p>to impound waters far in the mountains so </p><p>that this desert would be forever blessed. </p><p>As an engineer he knew the possibilities of </p><p>the country- in a vague way, but reality lay </p><p>in the future. He did not even fully realize</p><p>that the rest of the county was slowly com- </p><p>ing from its long sleep and that only in this </p><p>section was the last frontier. He only </p><p>knew he was disgusted and incredibly </p><p>lonely. He had not been so in his own </p><p>valley. That was his own. </p><p> “You can’t stand much of this,” he an-</p><p>nounced to his wife in the morning, as he </p><p>looked at the bare board walls of his room </p><p>while the partitions echoed snores from </p><p>other boudoirs. </p><p> “Why not?” she asked.</p><p> “Why not? With nothing to do, no</p><p>place to go, no one to talk to? I ought to </p><p>have thought of that before we came. </p><p>Why, it’ll kill you!” </p><p> “Well, you’re here, aren’t you?”</p><p> It was simply said, but it made Carlton</p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>17 </p><p>tingle. The doubts and depressions were </p><p>swept away instantly as if banished by a </p><p>fairy hand. The knowledge that he pos- </p><p>sessed this beautiful girl made him realize </p><p>that, even though perplexities sprang up on </p><p>every side, his game was worth playing. </p><p>And then immediately another distraction </p><p>made his brows wrinkle. How long could </p><p>this beautiful young wife go about such </p><p>a place without complications starting? </p><p>Carlton knew the general chivalry of the </p><p>West, but he also knew the free-and-easy </p><p>attitude of men accustomed to dance-hall </p><p>girls and the less free-and-easy ideas of </p><p>certain others who were not accustomed to </p><p>being balked. </p><p> The first complication along these lines</p><p>came late in the afternoon, when Carlton </p><p>returned to the hotel after looking over some </p><p>men who might assist him to hold his little </p><p>valley. His wife was seated on the ve- </p><p>randa, and alongside her was the quiet, </p><p>well-mannered Jim Black! </p><p> Black arose courteously when the en-</p><p>gineer arrived, and the engineer seated him- </p><p>self, feeling that Black was just a bit enter- </p><p>prising. </p><p> “Mr. Black has just been telling me about</p><p>Anam and Hue,” explained the wife, with a </p><p>smile. </p><p> “What?”</p><p> “Anam and Hue and Bangkok and Singa-</p><p>pore and a lot of other places. Mr. Black </p><p>has been all over the Orient!” She said it </p><p>as if she had made a find. </p><p> The engineer’s eyes narrowed. He knew</p><p>from many instances how the East Coast </p><p>blunts the morals of all but the strongest of</p><p>men, and he began to appraise Black better. </p><p>Black was a Westerner, all right, but he did </p><p>not fit into this settlement. He belonged </p><p>in some seaport town like San Francisco or </p><p>Seattle. Yet he had been here for a long </p><p>time. What was the answer? What was </p><p>he hiding from? </p><p> And Silent Jim had been talkative!</p><p> “I’d like to hear of Mr. Black’s travels—</p><p>all of them,” said Carlton with malicious </p><p>courtesy. </p><p> Black’s cold gray eyes flashed sideways</p><p>for an instant, but his reply was peace- </p><p>ful. </p><p> “Pleased to, some day,” he replied,</p><p>arising. “I’ll have to move along now. </p><p>Got to see a friend. Good day, Mrs. Carl- </p><p>ton; good day, Carlton!” And, tipping </p><p>his hat, he was off. </p><p>2 </p><p> There was a long period of silence on the</p><p>porch. </p><p> “He’s a mystery to me,” said the wife</p><p>at length. </p><p> “To every one,” grunted Carlton. He</p><p>produced a pipe and started filling it. “I </p><p>guess it’s best to let him alone,” he con- </p><p>cluded. </p><p> The girl’s brown eyes flickered as she</p><p>considered this. </p><p> “Well,” she offered, “he seems to be</p><p>about the best in the camp.” </p><p> “Maybe. Still, it might be wise to let</p><p>him alone. I don’t trust him.” </p><p> “Neither do I, exactly,” she admitted.</p><p>“That’s why I’m curious about him. </p><p>There’s something—something going on </p><p>somewhere, and he’s in it, and I don’t know </p><p>what it is.” </p><p> The engineer smiled grimly.</p><p> “You mean you want to pump him?”</p><p> “1 might be able to.”</p><p> The calm optimism of this innocent young</p><p>girl made Carlton gulp. He changed his </p><p>tactics. </p><p> “Know what a bobcat is?” he asked</p><p>suddenly. “It’s a lynx—a wildcat. Highly </p><p>excitable. Weil, if you want a real good </p><p>time, go get a nice lively one, bring it up </p><p>close to you and then ask it questions. </p><p>It’s no more dangerous than fooling with </p><p>Jim Black, and you'll get just as much </p><p>information!” </p><p>DAN DOLAN, however, tried it in </p><p>his own way and got something. </p><p>He was not really hoping for infor- </p><p>mation, but anything that came into his </p><p>net was welcome. He and Black hap-</p><p>pened to get together two days after </p><p>Carlton came to town, and they sat at </p><p>Dolan’s back-room table, where the boss </p><p>spun his webs. </p><p> “How’s Finch gittin’ along?” asked</p><p>Dolan casually, over a glass of beer. </p><p> “Dunno,” said Black.</p><p> ‘‘They say he’s got eary-sipilis,” volun-</p><p>teered the boss. “Pizen. There’s dirt in </p><p>the wound.” </p><p> Black nodded.</p><p> “Bum doctor!” continued the boss.</p><p> Black nodded again.</p><p> “Doctor prob’ly let dirt git in,” offered</p><p>Dolan. “New doctor cornin’ from down- </p><p>country to look him over. Finch’Ll prob’ly </p><p>git well.” </p><p> Black lifted a beer glass to his mouth.</p><p>i8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “I wish Finch’d gil out of town!” snapped</p><p> the boss.</p><p>“Why?” </p><p> “Yells and moans all night. Gittin’</p><p> worse. Hurts the hotel. People can’t</p><p> sleep. I own a half-interest in the hotel.’'</p><p> Black’s eyes flickered at this barbarous</p><p> commercialism, but still he said nothing.</p><p> “That noise must be hard on the Carlton</p><p> gal,” added the boss. “Darned shame.</p><p> No way to treat a lady like that. Fine gal,</p><p> ain’t she?”</p><p> Black nodded again.</p><p> “Worth havin’,” remarked the boss,</p><p> looking crafty. “Bet, if there wasn't nothin’</p><p> in the way, a young feller like you’d take a</p><p> chance.”</p><p> Black nodded again. The boss looked</p><p> at him curiously.</p><p> "If an accident hit that Carlton feller,</p><p> there’d be a scramble, all right,” observed</p><p> the boss very casually. He waited for</p><p> some remark, but none came. “Best-</p><p> lookin’ Ally that ever come to town,” he</p><p> finished.</p><p> Black looked wearied. Dolan changed</p><p> the subject.</p><p> “Think Finch may be all right soon?”</p><p> he asked.</p><p> Black sat back in his chair.</p><p> “Why do you ask me?” he demanded.</p><p> “Oh, I thought you was interested. Saw</p><p> you stand by him when he was shot. You</p><p> took him to the hotel.”</p><p> “Oh.”</p><p> “If he gits away, then he won’t disturb</p><p> the hotel,” said the boss. “Fact is, I’m</p><p> tired of him. Wish he’d go fer keeps. He’s</p><p> a pest. I’d help put up a purse to plant</p><p> him, jest for the public good.”</p><p> Black’s gaze became direct and cold.</p><p> “Not while I’m here!” he stated.</p><p> The boss was taken aback. This man</p><p> Black was believed to be for hire, and yet</p><p> here he turned down a bid! The boss knew</p><p> that Finch would not pay top prices for</p><p> any job. Dolan could easily beat Finch’s</p><p> bid, and yet Black had turned him down—</p><p> cold!</p><p> “Why?” asked the boss bluntly.</p><p> “Friend of mine,” snapped Black.</p><p> “How?” persisted Dolan.</p><p> “Helped me once.”</p><p> The boss looked curious. He knew that,</p><p> if Finch lived, Black would probably carry-</p><p> out his lethal contract against the engineer,</p><p> but here was an angle that was hard to</p><p>understand. Dolan assumed his most in </p><p>gratia ting air and leaned forward. </p><p> “How?” he asked.</p><p> Black looked half-defiant, but he let the</p><p>words come to his mouth. </p><p> “Two years ago I was broke. Sister</p><p>dying in Chicago. Also broke. Only rela- </p><p>tive 1 had. Best friend I ever had. Sick </p><p>and down and out. Pleaded for help. I </p><p>went crazy. Got desperate. Started ouL </p><p>with a gun to collect. New game for me— </p><p>don't like hold-ups. Caught Finch on the </p><p>road Got fifty dollars. 1 had a mask, </p><p>but he rcc’nized me. I said I had 10 have </p><p>the money. ^ He quit yelping and asked </p><p>me why. I told him. I’d have told any </p><p>one then. He said, ‘Keep the fifty.’ </p><p>Then he took me to his ranch and gave me </p><p>fifteen hundred dollars.” </p><p> The boss was staggered. Such a tale</p><p>about the crooked old miser of Lost Deer </p><p>Valley was incredible! </p><p> “It went to your sister?” gasped Dolan.</p><p> “She died happy.”</p><p> “And Finch loaned it?”</p><p> “No. He gave it.”</p><p>VI </p><p>THE boss nearly fell over. The </p><p>thought of the old miser of Lost </p><p>Deer Valley giving fifteen hundred </p><p>dollars to any one was incredible—unthink- </p><p>able! Black must l&gt;e lying. If not . . . </p><p> Dolan’s eyes narrowed at a new thought.</p><p> “That was two years ago?” he asked.</p><p> Black nodded.</p><p> The boss lashed his memory for the</p><p>episodes of two years back. Black had </p><p>been present for three years. In the first </p><p>one he had acquired a big part of his repu-</p><p>tation. The boss remembered Black’s </p><p>initial battle, staged right by the bar of </p><p>this dance-hall. There were a few low- </p><p>voiced sentences between Black and some </p><p>cattleman, then a quick reach for guns. </p><p>When the lightning of Jim Black's pistol </p><p>had struck, the cattleman was beyond </p><p>talking forever. What it was all about, </p><p>nobody ever knew. They only saw that </p><p>Black had fired in legitimate self-defense, </p><p>where delay would have been fatal. And </p><p>then there were other episodes—several of </p><p>them, </p><p> “My fault,” apologized the boss, mostly</p><p>to himself. “I oughta kept better track </p><p>of tilings. ” </p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>19 </p><p> Of course Finch had paid Black the</p><p>money! If Dolan were the most vicious </p><p>old miser in the county and saw a chance </p><p>to put under obligations a prize gunman, </p><p>Dolan might have done the same thing, </p><p>even though the cost broke his heart. The </p><p>bfl&amp;s was beginning to see into things he had </p><p>never dreamed of before. He had known </p><p>Finch casually, as he knew many others, </p><p>but that was all. </p><p> The wily old boss, however, knew the</p><p>political line-ups in the county, and he </p><p>knew of certain things that had happened </p><p>recently in his vicinity. Certain episodes, </p><p>for instance, where men with property had </p><p>vanished. He felt now that Black was </p><p>implicated in some of them. Also Finch. </p><p>He put two and two together and made a </p><p>staggering total, but he was not sure yet. </p><p>He wished now that he had been less frank </p><p>in expressing enmity to Finch. He felt </p><p>that, if apparently neutral, he might have </p><p>learned more. </p><p> But the boss had declared war; so he</p><p>decided to “stand pat.” </p><p> “I’ve got friends, too,” said the giant</p><p>quite frankly. “I'm a good deal like you. </p><p>If anything happened to some of ’em, I’d </p><p>be sorry. Darned sorry. Mebbe I’d grieve </p><p>too much and git excited. Then there’d be </p><p>regrets all around.” </p><p> Black’s gray eyes showed a flicker, but</p><p>he arose quite easily and stretched himself. </p><p> “That’s the way it goes,” he nodded.</p><p>“Well, I’ll be going along. Got to see a </p><p>friend. So long.” </p><p> The boss understood, and so did Black.</p><p>The big man now realized that, if it were </p><p>just an ordinary squabble about that little </p><p>Lost Deer Valley, things might have been</p><p>arranged with honor to both sides— but </p><p>Black had been elusive. It showed that a </p><p>deliberate program of some sort was being </p><p>carried out. </p><p> Beyond Dolan’s doorway stood eighteen</p><p>horses and mules hitched to a great wagon </p><p>that drew a trailer almost as large as itself— </p><p>one of the many counterparts of the </p><p>“twenty-mule team” now advertised all </p><p>over the country. Twenty mules were </p><p>nothing remarkable here. This outfit was </p><p>one of Dolan’s freight-teams that voyaged </p><p>across the dusty desert miles to the far- </p><p>away branch-line railroad, bringing in </p><p>merchandise and mails and taking out the </p><p>assorted products of small mines and a few </p><p>scattered ranches. To this equipage Dolan </p><p>soon made his way, holding an envelope </p><p>in his hand. </p><p> “Do you know Bill Campbell, down at</p><p>the county-seat?” he asked the driver. </p><p> The teamster rolled a quid of tobacco</p><p>in his hair-hidden mouth and said he wasn’t </p><p>quite sure. </p><p> “He’s a lawyer,” said the boss. “Got an</p><p>office in that shanty across from the court- </p><p>house. Tall feller. Good-lookin’. Light </p><p>hair. Give him this. Savvy?” </p><p> “Yeh,” responded the teamster, indiffer-</p><p>ently. </p><p> “Paste it in your hat!” roared the boss.</p><p>“That letter goes. See? Don’t forgit </p><p>it!” </p><p> In a land where ever}- one is a free citizen,</p><p>mandates do not go. A city delivery-man </p><p>takes orders. A desert freighter is likely </p><p>to wave a hand to the team and say, “Take </p><p>’em.” A freighter is a high professional </p><p>man with a temperament like a grand-opera </p><p>prima-donna. He knows his own value. </p><p>This one looked at the boss speculatively </p><p>for a moment but decided at length to </p><p>accede to the request. Thus Caleb Snow, </p><p>teamster, pushed into the desert with the </p><p>missive in his hat. He started after noon </p><p>so as to reach by evening a certain water- </p><p>hole from which he could best start for the </p><p>rest of the journey. Dolan had a regular </p><p>schedule for his freight-teams. </p><p>THE boss met Carlton the next day </p><p>in the general merchandise store, </p><p>where Dolan generally put in a few </p><p>hours supervising his sallow clerk, a waif </p><p>he had picked up from nowhere and tried to </p><p>train into usefulness. The boss stood at </p><p>the hardware counter while Mrs. Carlton </p><p>inspected some bolts .of cloth at the tiny </p><p>clry-goods nook.</p><p> “Fine gal,” opened Dolan to Carlton,</p><p>pointing with his thumb to the wife. </p><p> The engineer agreed with a nod, wonder-</p><p>ing what was coming next. </p><p> “How does she like it here?”</p><p> “Oh, so-so.”</p><p> “Lonely for her,” admitted the boss.</p><p>“How does she like Black?” </p><p> “Not much. Why?”</p><p> “How long before you can git back to the</p><p>valley?” asked the boss, ignoring the other’s </p><p>question. </p><p> “About two days. As soon as Jerry</p><p>Martin and Bob Arnold can get ready to </p><p>go with me. Why?” </p><p>20 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Then take the wife along.”</p><p> Carlton read a warning in it.</p><p> “What's the idea?” he asked.</p><p> “Jim Black. Been watchin’ him.</p><p>Finch’ll prob’ly git well. Coin’ to a hos- </p><p>pital down below, mebbe. May git well. </p><p>Savvy?” </p><p> “You mean?”</p><p> “I dunno. Not sure. Anyhow, git her</p><p>out of town. If Black likes her, there’s </p><p>trouble. If not, means trouble anyhow. </p><p>Mebbe Black might hang around a woman </p><p>jest to start somethin’. Husband flies off </p><p>the handle, mebbe. Brings things to a </p><p>show-down. Savvy?” </p><p> “Oh—rats! It sounds too far-fetched!”</p><p>The eyes of the old boss narrowed under </p><p>their heavy brows. </p><p> “Sure!” he admitted. “Sounds Like melly-</p><p>drammy. Only, let’s suppose things. </p><p>S’pose you was an old crook. Used a fine </p><p>valley to trap suckers. Trapped a lot. </p><p>Then a sucker came along who wouldn't </p><p>suck. Fought it out. Shot you in the leg. </p><p>Hit you with a fence-rail. Watched you </p><p>all the time with field-glasses. And s’pose </p><p>you had a gunman obliged to you for favors. </p><p>Then what?” The boss concluded very </p><p>slowly, making each word tell, “And s’pose </p><p>you was doin’ a lot of other queer business </p><p>and this young sucker was livin’ a mite too </p><p>close to you?” </p><p> “Great Scott!” said Carlton. “But what</p><p>is this ‘other business’?” </p><p> “Dunno. Mebbe I’ll find out soon. Sent</p><p>a letter down to the county-seat to a law- </p><p>yer.” </p><p> “You? Dealing with a lawyer?”</p><p> “Yep. Gotta git information. I work</p><p>through Bill Campbell. On the quiet. </p><p>I’m in bad with the county gang down</p><p>below.” </p><p> “County gang?” *</p><p> “Sure. Office-holders. They don’t like</p><p>me. Sheriff came up here once to git a </p><p>man. The man was innocent. I kicked </p><p>the sheriff out. The district attorney came. </p><p>I kicked him out. Deputy sheriffs came. </p><p>They got kicked out, too.” </p><p> Carlton visualized the exciting picture.</p><p> “Alone?” he asked.</p><p> “No; I had a few huskies with me.</p><p>Held off the whole mob till we compermised. </p><p>They got the party they wanted. Gave </p><p>him a legal trial. Freed him, accordin’ to </p><p>agreement. T was made a deputy sheriff. </p><p>I am yet. They keep outa here. I keep </p><p>outa there. It works fine. More or less, </p><p>that is.” </p><p> The engineer was getting a real insight</p><p>into the old saloou-man’s power. Here in </p><p>this last frontier, where the armed men of </p><p>the old West still flourished, Dan Dolan was </p><p>judge, jury and executioner. The laws^&gt;f </p><p>a county and a State were dispensed—or </p><p>dispensed with—according to agreements </p><p>made after a free-for-all fight! And yet it </p><p>seemed in keeping. It was as natural to </p><p>I his country^ as its sage-brush, its rattle- </p><p>snakes, its heat and its careless population. </p><p> “Huh,” commented the engineer, “it</p><p>must be a line gang of politicians down at </p><p>the county-seat!” </p><p> “Fine gang is right!” grunted the boss.</p><p>“Cheap crooks. Held office too long. </p><p>Think they can git away with anything. </p><p>Some day they’ll wake up! But they let </p><p>me alone. I’m not in on their deals; they’re </p><p>out of mine. Peace rules—mebbe. Think </p><p>you’ll take the wife back to your ranch?” </p><p> “I don’t know,” considered Carlton.</p><p>“Maybe I will. I’d like to have her with </p><p>me, anyhow.” </p><p> “Got plenty money?”</p><p> “Couple of thousand left. I guess I can</p><p>pull through.” </p><p> “Plenty more if you want it. Your</p><p>credit’s good with me. Go as far as vou </p><p>like.” </p><p> “Thanks.”</p><p> Glad of the backing but not wishing to</p><p>take advantage of it unless necessary, </p><p>Carlton was about to join his wife, who </p><p>looked as if she had heard much of the </p><p>conversation. She opened her lips to say </p><p>something just as a husky, excited man in </p><p>corduroys and blue shirt came clattering </p><p>through the doorway. </p><p> “Hey, Dolan!” he bawled. “Heard the</p><p>news?” </p><p> “No. What?”</p><p> “Cale Snow, your Leamster, was shot dead</p><p>at Mesquite Springs!” </p><p>vn </p><p>THE boss slammed a fist on the </p><p>counter. In an instant his face was </p><p>red with wrath. The cords on his </p><p>bull neck were swollen, while his eyes seemed </p><p>like lambent flames. The air seemed to be </p><p>charged with electricity. </p><p> “Who did il?” he thundered. “Tell me—</p><p>quick!” </p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>21 </p><p> “I don’t know,” said the informant.</p><p>‘‘Bob Lange, he was ridin’ by the springs </p><p>when he-” </p><p> “Where’s Lange?”</p><p> “Guess he’s over at Toby’s place. He</p><p> jest got in.”</p><p> “Go git him!”</p><p> The informant jumped out. The boss,</p><p>occupied with his own sulfuric thoughts, </p><p>started walking up and down the one aisle </p><p>of his store, forgetting Carlton and every- </p><p>thing else. Dolan’s little clerk, who had </p><p>been writing in a small cage, peered over </p><p>his desk nervously. </p><p> “Gee!” he gulped. “Somebody’s in for</p><p> it!”</p><p> Carlton and his wife turned toward him.</p><p> “Somebody hurt one of the boss’s teams-</p><p> ters before,” said the awestricken clerk.</p><p> “The boss caught the feller that done it</p><p> and broke him in two. With his hands!”</p><p> Dolan happened to look around. The</p><p> clerk ducked his head again just as two</p><p> men came through the front door together.</p><p> One was the informant, and the other was</p><p> a short, stocky, round-faced man with the</p><p> bow legs of a seasoned rider. The boss</p><p> seemed to shoot a question straight into</p><p> his face:</p><p> “Lange, who shot Snow?”</p><p> “1 dunno.”</p><p> “Where’d you find him?”</p><p> “Right alongside the spring. Under the</p><p> mesquite.”</p><p> “Killed?”</p><p> “He cashed in about an hour after I</p><p>arrived.” </p><p> “When did you git there?”</p><p> “This momin’.”</p><p> “Where was Aleck Jordan?” This ap-*</p><p>parently referred to Snow’s assistant. Some </p><p>one usually accompanies every desert- </p><p>freighter.</p><p> “1 dunno. No trace of him.”</p><p> “Ran away! I oughta known it! White-</p><p>livered skunk! -me; if I ever see him </p><p> again he’ll jun, all right! WTiere was the</p><p> team?”</p><p> “Right by the wagons, with feed-bags</p><p> still on ’em. The harness was off. My</p><p> pardner’s bringin’ 'em in. We rode up to</p><p> the wells this morn in’, and there was that</p><p> team with nobody tendin’ ’em. That</p><p> looked queer; so I hollered. Somebody</p><p> gurgled from the well—you know that</p><p> little spring under the mesquite—and so I</p><p> went hootin’ over there. Snow was lyin’</p><p> on his side, with red under his chest. He</p><p> said ‘Dolan.’ Then he stopped. After</p><p> I’d washed him some, he said:</p><p> “ ‘They come up behind me. Last</p><p>night. Two of ’em. In masks. They </p><p>made Jordan hop into the desert. Then </p><p>they took away my money and a letter in my </p><p>hat.’ That was about all. He had a piece </p><p>of red bandanna in his hand—here it is. </p><p>From what I gather, they stopped and held </p><p>him up. Prob’ly they took his gun away. </p><p>Mebbe he had another under the wagon- </p><p>seat. He made a break for the wagon, I </p><p>guess, and then they tried to stop him. </p><p>There was signs of a struggle by the wheels. </p><p>Then he must ’a’ reached for the other </p><p>fellow’s gun and got plugged. He got </p><p>some of the mask, though. See it?” </p><p> The stranger handed over a piece of red</p><p>bandanna with an exaggerated fleur-de-lis </p><p>pattern, torn on two sides. The boss </p><p>grabbed it savagely with a queer expres- </p><p>sion on his face. Carlton saw something </p><p>was coming and turned to his wife. </p><p> “Go back to the hotel!” he whispered.</p><p>The girl looked curious but thought it </p><p>best to accede. </p><p> The boss was in a storming rage by now.</p><p>He did not notice her going. He did not </p><p>notice anything except that piece of red </p><p>bandanna. He looked at it closely, and </p><p>then a cruel smile came to his face. </p><p> “Where’s Tom Yager?” he asked the</p><p>informant suddenly. </p><p> “Over at the hotel. Sleepin’ off last</p><p>night’s drunk.” </p><p> “Where’s Axel Yager?”</p><p> “I dunno.’' The informant's eyes turned</p><p>toward the other jnan. “Wasn’t he over </p><p>at Looey Bums’?” he asked. “Seems like </p><p>I seen him a short time ago.” </p><p> “Yeh,” said the other.</p><p> “Go over and git him!'' ordered Dolan</p><p>to Lange, the short man. “Tell him I</p><p>want to see liim about them samples from </p><p>his minin’ claim.” </p><p> The messenger was apparently a trusted</p><p>friend of Dolans and ran out willingly. </p><p>The boss started pacing up and down the </p><p>aisle again like an angry lion, shaking his </p><p>shaggy head and clenching his great fists. </p><p>Carlton kept out of his wav. </p><p> After a time the messenger returned with</p><p>another man—a gangling, stoop-shouldered </p><p>desert-rat with shifty blue eyes and faded </p><p>overalls hanging by one sweaty gallus. </p><p>Dolan seemed to control himself instantly </p><p>22 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>when the newcomer entered. There was </p><p>a set smile on the boss’s face, and he almost </p><p>purred. The other men got away from </p><p>him, looking nervous. </p><p> “ 'Lo, Yager,” greeted Dolan. “Where</p><p>you been lately? Ain’t seen you much.” </p><p> The other answered laconically, and his</p><p>side-shifting eyes showed he was ill at ease. </p><p> "Been up to the mine lately?” purred the</p><p>boss. </p><p> "Yeh. A few days ago.”</p><p> “Where was you yesterday? Wanted to</p><p>see you.” </p><p> "Oh, I was around town. Over at</p><p>Looey’s, mostly." </p><p> "Where was you last night?”</p><p> It came like a whip-lash. The man’s</p><p>eyes shifted again, and he seemed non- </p><p>plused. He was not quick-witted. He </p><p>stood there like an oaf, sensing that some- </p><p>thing was wrong but not knowing just how </p><p>to reply. </p><p> "You was at Mesquite Springs!” thun-</p><p>dered the boss. </p><p> Carlton caught his breath. The other</p><p>turned white. He put up his hands as if </p><p>to fend off something. His jaw drooped, </p><p>and his eyes twitched. </p><p> The boss sprang forward like a tiger.</p><p> “I’ve got you now!" he snarled. "Thought</p><p>you’d git away with it. With me? With </p><p>me? Huh!” </p><p>DOLAN’S mighty left arm grasped </p><p>the back of the man’s neck. The </p><p>right hand reached forward. Its </p><p>muscled fingers clutched the throat and </p><p>lifted the screeching man off the floor, </p><p>flinging him backward pn to the counter. </p><p>There was a thud and a squeal. The man’s </p><p>eyes were popping from their sockets, and </p><p>his face was distorted inhumanly. </p><p> "Who told you to do it?” bellowed the</p><p>boss.</p><p> There was a gurgle from the wide mouth</p><p>that sounded like a stifled shriek. Dolan </p><p>ran a linger along the throat, under the </p><p>jaw. </p><p> The man squirmed sicldshly and flailed</p><p>his long legs in every direction. Carlton </p><p>turned away, wondering what to do. </p><p> "Who told you to kill Snow?” roared the</p><p>boss. "Quick! You’ve only got a second </p><p>to live!” </p><p> Carlton couldn't stand it any longer.</p><p> "Don’t!” he shouted. "Man alive—</p><p>don’tl” </p><p> He dared the ferocious WTath of the boss</p><p>and laid a hand on the muscled shoulder, </p><p>trying to pull it away. </p><p> “Shut up!’’ roared Dolan, turning his</p><p>savage eyes on the engineer. “Git out of </p><p>my way—quick!’’ And with one heave of </p><p>those powerful shoulders he shoved Carlton </p><p>across the aisle. </p><p> Then the boss looked dowTi upon his</p><p>victim again. This time his voice was </p><p>very soft and smooth. </p><p> “Tell me before I strangle you!”</p><p> “Black!” gasped the suffering man.</p><p> The boss bared his white teeth in a</p><p>w'ollish smile. </p><p> "Jim Black!’’ he snarled. “I thought</p><p>so! What for? What did he want? Quick </p><p>—answer!” </p><p> “Money!” choked the other.</p><p> The boss ran his finger under the jaw</p><p>again. The other screeched. </p><p> “A letter! A letter! Snow fought. Oh!</p><p>Leggo me!” </p><p> “Was Black there?” insisted the boss.</p><p> “No. It was Lige Hackett.” This re-</p><p>ferred to one of the worthless loafers hang- </p><p>ing around town. </p><p> Carlton had recovered his "balance, but he</p><p>found himself trembling and perspiring as </p><p>the result of the fiendish scene he was wit- </p><p>nessing. Every nerve in his body was </p><p>tingling. He knew the boss was his friend; </p><p>he admired Dolan for many things, but </p><p>here the boss sickened him. Though the </p><p>man probably deserved this punishment, </p><p>Dolan’s wTatli was too inhuman, and Carl- </p><p>ton feared—knew—that before his eyes a </p><p>man’s neck was about to be broken. He </p><p>rushed forward with all his desperate </p><p>strength and tore at those cruel fingers </p><p>madly. </p><p> “Quit it—quit it!” he pleaded. “Dolan</p><p>—come out of it! It’s murder—murder! </p><p>You’ll be as bad as he is!" </p><p> The savage eyes of the boss glared at him</p><p>for an instant, and Carlton wondered if he, </p><p>too, were to be a victim; th^n the giant </p><p>passed an elbow in front of his eyes. And, </p><p>when they were cleared again, they were </p><p>sane. </p><p> “Holy smoke!” came the voice of Lange,</p><p>behind Carlton, in awTe at the miracle. </p><p> “What the—what do you want me to</p><p>do?” roared the boss. "Kiss him?” </p><p> "No, but don’t kill him. You’re a</p><p>deputy sheriff. Why not arrest him?” </p><p> The idea seemed to be utterly novel, and</p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>23 </p><p>the boss showed quizzical wrinkles about </p><p>his eyes. </p><p> “I might,” he ruminated, “but how about</p><p>that county gang? Think I want them </p><p>cornin’ up here? Nix!” </p><p> “Well, why not take the prisoner down</p><p>there?” suggested the engineer. </p><p> The faces of the other men showed queer</p><p>smiles. Dolan also began to grin. The </p><p>thought of himself descending from his </p><p>high rookery in the foot-hills to parade a </p><p>prisoner into the county-seat, before the </p><p>astonished and nervous gaze of the enemy </p><p>politicians, struck the boss’s sense of humor </p><p>so that his grin became broad. Carlton </p><p>did not realize how deep was the line of </p><p>demarcation between the county’s office- </p><p>holders and the lord of this foot-hill settle- </p><p>ment. </p><p> The engineer could not know of all the</p><p>tricks started by the politicians down below </p><p>with the purpose of “getting” Dolan for </p><p>past disfavors; neither did he ken of certain </p><p>crafty efforts to compel a willing but timor- </p><p>ous Board of Supervisors to cancel Dolan’s </p><p>county liquor license. Carlton was blithely </p><p>stepping into the history of fifteen years of </p><p>red feud between Dolan, -with his axes to </p><p>grind, and the politicians, with their axes </p><p>to grind—but he did not know it. Dolan </p><p>did. </p><p> “No,” said the boss. “Better leave well</p><p>enough alone. I’ll arrest this man and let </p><p>some one else take him into town.” He </p><p>turned to the prisoner. “Hey, you— </p><p>you’re ’rested! Git that? You make a </p><p>move, and I’ll ram your heels into the back </p><p>of your throat!” The sight of the lout </p><p>seemed to make Dolan’s temper rise again. </p><p>“What did Black give you for the job?” </p><p>he roared suddenly. </p><p> The other shuffled his feet.</p><p> “Nawthin’,” he muttered.</p><p> ‘‘What? Nothin’?” The boss reached</p><p>out his hand again. “Quit that lyin’, or </p><p>I’ll strangle you again!” </p><p> The other flinched.</p><p> “No!7’ he cried, anxious to appease and</p><p>now hasty with explanations. “Black </p><p>didn’t give me nothin’. It was Finch. A </p><p>long time ago. Finch grub-staked me </p><p>four times. He gits his supplies from the </p><p>Yampa mine-freighters; so nobody knew </p><p>about it. Then he called the debt. He </p><p>sez he didn’t want my mine. Sez he </p><p>wanted pers’nal service. Later on he sez </p><p>fer me to join Black when Black wanted </p><p>me. Then Black wanted me.” The man </p><p>gulped. “I didn’t intend to do it, but </p><p>Black sez it was easy. An’ then Snow </p><p>started scrappin’, and—things happened!” </p><p>“Yeh,” said Dolan bitterly. “I git you. </p><p>I’m gettin’ a lot of things! How long ago </p><p>did Finch call the loan?” </p><p> “Oh, six months ago.”</p><p> The boss seemed to ponder for some</p><p>time, looking at the floor. Suddenly he </p><p>grabbed the man, searched him, swept him </p><p>into a little bare cubby-hole in the back of </p><p>the store, locked the padlock, stormed </p><p>through the door into the dance-hall, took </p><p>a sawed-off shotgun from behind the bar, </p><p>examined it and then strode outside. </p><p> It all happened so quickly that it left no</p><p>time for remarks from the others, and Dolan </p><p>seemed to invite none. When it was over, </p><p>the two men looked at Carlton and grinned. </p><p> “Phew!” said the bow-legged Lange.</p><p>“He’s started now!” </p><p> “Yeh,” agreed the other. “Goin’ after</p><p>Lige Hackett, the pal—or mebbe Jim </p><p>Black.” </p><p> “Think we’d better follow him?” sug-</p><p>gested Carlton. </p><p> “Not on your life! Don’t butt in!” The</p><p>man mopped his face with a bandanna. </p><p>“Let’s have a drink,” he offered. </p><p> The engineer felt he needed something</p><p>just then; so they ambled up to the scarred </p><p>old mahogany bar. </p><p>MIKE, the bartender, served them </p><p>offhandedly. He was telling some </p><p>history to a few cattlemen and </p><p>could not stop his talk even when the boss </p><p>came for a shotgun. Mike was trained </p><p>not to interfere with the affairs of others, </p><p>and thus he had lived happily and gained </p><p>fat for many years. </p><p> “ Yessir,” said Mike, “this here mahogany</p><p>bar was once the finest licker-chute in the </p><p>whole Southwest, bar none. Yessir! She’s </p><p>old and scarred and busted now, but time</p><p>was when folks used to cross the hull State </p><p>jest to drink here. That was after Dan </p><p>Dolan first got known in the countrv. But </p><p>he earned it; j'essir, he earned it!* Why, </p><p>the things that feller went through to git </p><p>that forty-foot piece of mahogany here </p><p>would drive a hull regiment plum starin* </p><p>crazy! Yessir! Dan Dolan nursed that bar </p><p>through three hundred an' eighty miles of </p><p>the dog-gonedest country the devil ever </p><p>built! Yessirl </p><p>24	Adventure</p><p> “How? Why, he jest pulled her here</p><p>by the roots! Lemme see—that was about </p><p>’seventy-four or live; I forgit wljich. The </p><p>boss was jest a kid then—all vim an' go an’ </p><p>muscle an5 ginger, fightin’ all day an’ </p><p>dandn’ all night. There was nothin' to </p><p>this here town them days—only a few tents </p><p>an’ a few mewls an' a few men an' a few </p><p>burros. When the boss come, he seen there </p><p>was goin’ to be a lot of prospectors an’ </p><p>ranchers in these parts; so he figgered on </p><p>gittin' ready for trade. First thing he </p><p>built was a saloon. Then he figgered on </p><p>a gen’ral merchandise store, but there wasn’t </p><p>no stock hereabouts lor a store; so he went </p><p>outside to git things. </p><p> ■'In them days there wasn’t no branch-</p><p>line railroad. Only the main line, ’way </p><p>north. There wasn’t no road, only a trail. </p><p>Well, Dan lit out with twelve mewls an' a </p><p>big wagon. After he got to the railroad— </p><p>three hundred an' eighty miles in Winter, </p><p>gents—he made up his mind that, as long’s </p><p>he'd started business, he’d start right. So </p><p>along with the other things he orders a </p><p>gosh-woUopin’ bar from Saint Looey and </p><p>camps down an' waits till she arrives. </p><p> “ Bout three months later that bar</p><p>lopes in on a freight-car. The boss had her </p><p>set up on the platform, an’, when he seen </p><p>how shiny an' line she was, with a lot of </p><p>dewdabs an’ dingbats an’ fancy scroll-work, </p><p>there was nothin’ on earth could make him </p><p>take her down again. D’ye think Dan </p><p>Dolan was goin’ to drag jest a lot of boards </p><p>around? No. sir; no style to that! He </p><p>wanted to advertise her. and he did. It </p><p>got so that the hull darned country up there </p><p>wanted to keep the bar; so he loaded her </p><p>on to the wagon quiet, pertected the wood- </p><p>work with sacks, tied her well down and </p><p>then pulled out fer home, with ten feet of </p><p>that bar stickin' out of the wagon. </p><p> “The boss started from here with ten</p><p>men. Sort of an escort of honor. He </p><p>started back with twelve—two volunteers.</p><p>The men rode on lop of the bar. and the wet </p><p>goods an’ merchandise was packed under- </p><p>neath. maltin' a neat little cargo. Well, </p><p>this here parade went along line till up in </p><p>the Juniper Mountains some fool emptied </p><p>his pipe through the vents in the bar. </p><p>Underneath some licker had got loose; so </p><p>after the fire was out most of the mer- </p><p>chandise was overboard and the bar was </p><p>considerable black in spots, but still she </p><p>was there, and that w^as all the boss wanted </p><p> “There was a bunch of Injuns on the</p><p>war-path about that lime over in western </p><p>Nevada. They scattered into little war- </p><p>parties to raise as much-as possible, </p><p>and one of these here parties run into Dan </p><p>an’ the l&gt;ar. The boys lifted the tiling off'n </p><p>the wagon an’ made a little fort out of it </p><p>till the Injuns got de-pressed and lit out— </p><p>them that was left. The rest is there </p><p>yet, </p><p> “Dan’s party was all shot up. Six men</p><p>was gone; two more was down; seven mewls </p><p>had drifted to heaven; the bar was full of </p><p>holes, an’ Dan Dolan was ragin’ mad. </p><p>They say it took him two days to cool </p><p>down. He wanted to chase them Injuns </p><p>all over Nevada for pluggin’ his bar. </p><p> “Finally the boss reorgnized himself, an’</p><p>they started off again with everything </p><p>overlx&gt;ard but the bar, seven men an’ a </p><p>fewr overloaded mewls. The boss had his </p><p>jaw set then. It looked like luck was trvin’ </p><p>to beat him; so he swore to git that mahog- </p><p>any here if he had to drag it! But, except </p><p>for an axle or two breakin’ here an’ there </p><p>an' gittin' bogged down in the mountains </p><p>when the rain come, everything went along </p><p>so-so till they came to Mud Creek. </p><p> “A big cloudburst arrived that evenin’,</p><p>sent forty billion gallons of water down </p><p>Mud Creek all at once, scooped out five </p><p>thousand acres of Mud Creek Canon an’ </p><p>sent that bar ten miles down-stream! </p><p> “Dolan swore enough bad language to</p><p>supply the State for twenty years, but still </p><p>he wouldn’t let go of that bar! Three men </p><p>went down-stream an' was never seen </p><p>again. Dolan an’ three others got the </p><p>animals to higher ground an’ watched the </p><p>wagon an’ bar breeze away at fifty miles per </p><p>hour, an’ still the boss wouldn’t give in! </p><p> “When daylight come, the waters was</p><p>down some, an' the !x&gt;ss found his wagon </p><p>’way down-stream. draped around a tree </p><p>that w as standin’ upside dow n. The other </p><p>fellers pried the wagon loose, but the boss </p><p>kept after that bar. He found her nice</p><p>polished top grindin’ the face off a half-acre </p><p>granite boulder, but still he'd found her, an’ </p><p>that was what he wanted. Then another </p><p>trouble came. One of the comer-posts </p><p>had worked loose an’ was gone. That </p><p>meant tacklin' about twenty thousand </p><p>acres of swampy ground, lookin’ for that </p><p>post. But he found her, gents. It took </p><p>three days, but he found her! She’s right </p><p>under my foot now, gents—old style </p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>25 </p><p>mahogany and four foot wide—an’ that was </p><p>twenty-live years ago! </p><p> “Well, in about a week he had that bar</p><p>up on the wagon, and they started off again. </p><p>There was only three of 'em then because </p><p>one had got too far into the swamp-waters. </p><p>There was only four mewls; there was </p><p>notiiin’ but rope for harness; there was no </p><p>provisions, no terbacker, no hope—but they </p><p>still had that bar! </p><p> “Well, after livin’ on the country—</p><p>mostly jack-rabbit—this here procession </p><p>got within a hundred miles of home. The </p><p>boss was startin’ to feel better when up by </p><p>Sandy Mountain, on the Nevada line, the </p><p>off hind wheel of the wagon curled up an’ </p><p>quit forever. Jest resigned unanimous. </p><p>Well, the boss, he sat on a rock an' swore </p><p>so bad he twisted the tails on the mewls, </p><p>but do you think that fellow’d quit? No, </p><p>sir! That bar was cornin’ into Mirage if </p><p>he had to bite it into chunks an’ bring the </p><p>pieces in his teeth! Yessir! </p><p> '‘They pried some boards under the axle</p><p>to make a sling, but, when they tried to </p><p>start, them four mewls couldn’t budge the </p><p>thing. Sand was up to the hubs, anyhow. </p><p>There the boss was stuck again; so he </p><p>breezed out for some more animals. There </p><p>was a peaceful Injun camp a few miles </p><p>away where they had a lot of young hosses. </p><p>The boss tried to dicker, but they couldn't </p><p>savvy the lingo; so he borried them colts, </p><p>anyhow. </p><p>“WHEN Dan Dolan got them </p><p>eight wild Injun mustangs hitched </p><p>to them four mewls an’ that wagon, </p><p>things begun to happen. Yessir! First </p><p>thing Dan knew, that bar was makin’ sixty </p><p>miles per hour, bumpin’ over rocks, boulders </p><p>an' crags, with the hosses kickin’ an’ trvin’ </p><p>to go in every direction an’ Dan trvin’ to </p><p>hold ’em down. He fell off once an’ got </p><p>dragged. He lost his last terbacker, lost </p><p>his matches, lost his watch, lost his temper, </p><p>lost his shirt an’ most of his pants, but still</p><p>he hung on to that bar. One feller got slid </p><p>off for good, but they wasn’t stoppin’ jest </p><p>then fer anything. They jest ripped an’ </p><p>snorted an’ rattled an’ banged along them </p><p>trails like a drunken comet! </p><p> “They got within fifty miles of here</p><p>when the outfit struck a chuck-hole. Dan </p><p>says that was the most gosh-wollopin’ </p><p>chuck-hole ever invented, and she jest </p><p>happened to be in the wrong place. She </p><p>was a big crack where the trail quits cornin’ </p><p>down-hill, turns quick, an' starts up-hill. </p><p>Dan’s brakes w'as gone an’ them mustangs </p><p>swept dowm that hill like a stampede—each </p><p>animal with his ears back, his eyes wild </p><p>an’ his tail stickin" straight out, humpin’ </p><p>along like greased lightnin’, with Dan </p><p>pullin’ an’ sweatin' like a wild man. When </p><p>that outfit hit that chuck-hole—bang! </p><p>Kindlin’-wood! </p><p> “Dan came to with a gash in his shoulder,</p><p>a piece of rope in his hands an’ that bar </p><p>standin’ on end, laughin’ at him. Then </p><p>the boss really got mad—so mad he couldn’t </p><p>even swear. But did he give up? No, sir; </p><p>he was jest startin’! </p><p> “The mustangs was gone fer good.</p><p>Mebbe they was the daddies of that band </p><p>of wild hosses folks sometimes see up in the </p><p>Smoke Range country. Also, the mewds </p><p>was gone. They’d come home a-rampin. </p><p>What did Dan do, you say? Why, the boss </p><p>walked in here with no shirt an’ mostly no </p><p>pants, rested one night an’ then collected </p><p>an outfit the next day for the grand entry. </p><p>There w’asn't many wagons here then. </p><p>Only one old cart an’ some spare wheels. </p><p>So the boss took that cart, took them </p><p>wiieels, took eight mewls, took three men </p><p>an’ started out to git that bar. </p><p> “Yessir, you’ve guessed it. He used</p><p>the cart fer the front, put the spare wheels </p><p>right on to the bar an’ sailed her into </p><p>Mirage one day like he was the King of </p><p>Spain returning from a victory! Proud? </p><p>Haughty? Why, all he needed was a </p><p>nigger to fan him so’s he’d look like Cle- </p><p>opatry on that there barge, like the picture </p><p>over there. Yessir! Half the town’s folks </p><p>was gone; most of the mewls was'dead; the </p><p>bar looked like scrambled eggs, and the boss </p><p>was all busted up an’ caved in—but Dan </p><p>Dolan got that bar into Mirage! Yessir. </p><p>She was rebuilt, an' she’s right here in front </p><p>of you. Your pleasure, gents!” </p><p> “But,” interrupted one of the men,</p><p>“how did Dolan get the stock to go with </p><p>the bar?”</p><p> “How?" demanded the bartender scorn-</p><p>fully. “Howr? Why, he started right back </p><p>an’ done it all over again with the supplies! </p><p>That s how he done it! There’s some people </p><p>can be made to quit, gents, but the boss, </p><p>he belongs to another family. Yessir! </p><p>Yes—sir!” </p><p> Underneath it all, Carlton wondered at</p><p>the misguided tenacity and misdirected </p><p>26 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>heroism which would cause a sane man </p><p>to suffer so nobly for such an utterly worth- </p><p>less cause. And yet, still further under- </p><p>neath—was it worthless? As the voluble </p><p>old bartender intimated, the incident ad- </p><p>vertised Dan Dolan and his goods through- </p><p>out the Southwest and laid the foundations </p><p>for a power which now seemed to hold this </p><p>district in the hollow of one mighty hand. </p><p> Thus in its last analysis the thing was a</p><p>masterpiece of business acumen, and yet— </p><p>the man who had shown such acuteness was </p><p>probably out now, laying all his brains </p><p>aside, bringing himself into the gutter with </p><p>the rest and giving vent to his dangerous </p><p>passions by committing murder with a shot- </p><p>gun! Carlton was not sure, but he thought </p><p>he had heard a muffled report from some- </p><p>where outside during the bartender’s nar- </p><p>rative. </p><p> The men drank in silence, as if waiting</p><p>for something to happen. The engineer </p><p>took a small drop for sociability, then </p><p>turned and looked outside the door toward </p><p>the ramshackle street. A shadow crossed </p><p>Dolan’s board walk; then heavy footsteps </p><p>sounded upon it. The boss strode in </p><p>with the shotgun still in his hand, looking </p><p>neither to right nor left. He passed behind </p><p>the bar, threw the gun open, tossed out an </p><p>empty shell, blew down the barrel, threw </p><p>in a fresh cartridge and put the weapon </p><p>under the bar. After which he wiped his </p><p>hands on his trousers. </p><p> “Well, what happened?” asked Carlton.</p><p> “Got him,” grunted Dolan.</p><p> “WTio?” they all chorused.</p><p> “Yager’s pal. Lige Hackett.”</p><p> “Dead?” asked the engineer.</p><p> “Yeh. He reached for a gun.”</p><p> It was a calm, easy statement. Carlton</p><p>couldn't admire that side of his friend. It </p><p>gave him the chills. Also, there were con- </p><p>sequences to consider. Though the old </p><p>free-and-easy customs were still in effect </p><p>here, the laws of the State were gaining </p><p>ground daily and must be reckoned with.</p><p>And then Carlton remembered that Dolan </p><p>was “in bad*’ with certain persons “down </p><p>below” at the county-seat. And the boss </p><p>had taken the law into his own hands. </p><p> “Well,” surmised the engineer slowly,</p><p>“I suppose we’ll have investigations and </p><p>things. The folks down below will all be up </p><p>here.” </p><p> “They will not!” scorned the boss.</p><p> “How do you make that out?”</p><p> There was the old, shrewd, satisfied ex-</p><p>pression on Dolan’s face that showed he </p><p>had not laid his brains aside after all. </p><p> “Confound it,” roared the boss, “Didn’t</p><p>you remind me I was a deputy sheriff? </p><p>Well, then Hackett died legal. He died </p><p>resistin’ an officer!’' </p><p>VIII </p><p>IT WAS a clincher. The genial old </p><p>thug was so satisfied about his flaw- </p><p>less act of manslaughter that Carlton </p><p>could only gasp. He felt himself coming </p><p>under the spell which made the others </p><p>bestow upon the boss an awe that was tinged </p><p>with admiration or fear, according to the </p><p>view-point. In a way the engineer was be- </p><p>ginning to be nervous about Dolan. It was </p><p>like asking water to put out a fire and </p><p>receiving a cloudburst. Carlton began to </p><p>wonder how it was all going to end. Then </p><p>he started wondering how it began. </p><p> “Arc—are you sure you got the right</p><p>man?” he asked at length. </p><p> “Sure? Why, didn’t Axel Yager say</p><p>Hackett helped to kill Snow?” </p><p> “Yes. Yes. I heard that. But how</p><p>did you know Yager was the right man?” </p><p>“Didn’t he confess?” </p><p> “Yes. But how’ did vou know before</p><p>that?” </p><p> The boss leaned across the bar and spoke</p><p>very patiently. </p><p> “Didn’t I tell you once I was a merchant?</p><p>Yeh. You remember. Well, 'bout twelve </p><p>years ago I got a lot of bandannas. One </p><p>set had a fioor-dc-lee pattern. I sold ’em </p><p>out years ago, ’ceptin’ one. Jest one. I </p><p>put her away among the old stock. She </p><p>roosted there for years. Then two weeks </p><p>ago the Yager brothers came in for a </p><p>bandanna. I served 'em myself. I was </p><p>out of the stuff right then; so I dug around, </p><p>Found that one. Sold it to Tom or Axel, </p><p>I forgit which. She was the only floor-de- </p><p>lee in the whole county. The pattern went </p><p>out years ago. Then Snow got killed. He </p><p>had hold of that rag. It was Tom or Axel </p><p>killed him, but I didn’t know which. Tom</p><p>was slecpin’ off a long jag; so it was Axel. </p><p>See? I t’s simple to guess things when you’re </p><p>a merchant, son!” </p><p> Carlton gave in. The boss was too much</p><p>for him. As a deputy sheriff Dolan had </p><p>completed a comfortable killing; as a mer- </p><p>chant he had tracked down a murderer, and </p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>27 </p><p>as a saloon-keeper he had provided for the </p><p>shooting of Ebenezer Finch. Carlton won- </p><p>dered what other jobs or positions he </p><p>held. </p><p> “Did you meet up with any one else?”</p><p>asked the engineer, meaning jim Black. </p><p> “No.” The face of the boss skewered</p><p>into perplexed wrinkles again. “Come into </p><p>the store, Carlton; I want to see you.” </p><p> The curious engineer followed him back to</p><p>the environment of barter and sale, and the </p><p>boss leaned against a pile of blue overalls. </p><p> “Black's beat it. What do you make of it</p><p>all?” asked Dolan, assured of privacy here. </p><p> “I don't know,” admitted the engineer.</p><p>“It seems as if one tiling has led to another. </p><p>I know it isn’t all about my little valley, </p><p>anyhow.” </p><p> “No. That’s a side issue. Finch got</p><p>you in; then somethin’ came along bigger </p><p>than you. Then he wanted you out quick. </p><p>He tried the old boss game, but it wouldn’t </p><p>work. Takes too much time, anyhow. </p><p>So he got Black on your trail. He wanted </p><p>to git you out quick. Why? I’ll tell you. </p><p>It's because there’s somethin’ big doin’ </p><p>in this county, and he’s got a finger in it. </p><p>It's crooked, or he'd be out of it. Black’s </p><p>in it, too. Now, what is it, and where’s </p><p>Black gone to?” </p><p> “Maybe to the county-seat.”</p><p> Dolan nodded.</p><p> “I think, so. Prob’ly lit out as soon’s he</p><p>seen my note to Lawyer Campbell, after </p><p>Snow died. He must have watched me </p><p>talkin’ to Snow. I gave the letter to Snow, </p><p>and he seemed careless about it; so I yelled </p><p>at him. Black must have thought it was </p><p>important. Mebbe he wanted to know </p><p>how much I knew. That’s how Snow got </p><p>killed." The boss pondered for a moment. </p><p>“Funny thing—I didn’t know that letter </p><p>was important myself!” </p><p> “What?”</p><p> “Naw. I jest took a guess. I was</p><p>gropin’ in the dark. Do you know what </p><p>was in that note? I jest asked Campbell </p><p>to look over the county records. Wanted </p><p>to see how much land Finch or Black</p><p>owned in this country’.” </p><p> “What got that idea into your head?”</p><p>“Because,” said the boss,* “there’s been </p><p>some funny doin’s in this county for the past </p><p>year, and I didn't pay much ’terition to them, </p><p>because I had my own troubles. I was </p><p>asleep at the switch. When you came into </p><p>the country7, you woke me up. I pulled </p><p>you along because I wanted to see what </p><p>was doin’. Then I begun to see there was </p><p>more goin’ on than I ever dreamed of. I </p><p>got to rememberin’ backward to certain </p><p>happenin’s where men took up land around </p><p>here and then blew away'. D’ye begin to </p><p>see?” </p><p> Carlton saw. The boss abandoned his</p><p>choppy language and talked straight, and </p><p>the engineer was struck between the eyes </p><p>by the revelation. </p><p> “There’s been a big land-grabbing deal</p><p>here, and Finch is in it. I see. But what's </p><p>the purpose of it? And what is there </p><p>crooked in that?” </p><p> Dolan answered the last question first</p><p>“Nothin’—mebbe. Only, there was a </p><p>couple of people owed Finch money’ and </p><p>disappeared. They’ was friends of mine. </p><p>Good friends. They blew away sudden. I </p><p>didn't know they" owed Finch money. I </p><p>ain’t sure yet. I only got rumors long after </p><p>they went. But if the county records show </p><p>that Finch has their property-” </p><p> The boss closed his fingers into a mighty</p><p>fist and looked down upon it. </p><p> “Savvy? Supposin’ there was other folks</p><p>like that all over the county? How should </p><p>I know? People come and go. And sup- </p><p>posin’ there was a lot of prospectors tradin’ </p><p>at the Yampa mine store? Finch owns </p><p>stock in the Yampa. I hear. Suppose them </p><p>prospectors had hard luck and ran up bills </p><p>they" couldn’t pay*? S'pose Finch asked </p><p>for pers’nal service? Suppose there was a </p><p>lot of dummy homesteaders in these lands </p><p>around here? What do you think of it?” </p><p>CARLTON did not know what to </p><p>think. In fact, it was hard to con- </p><p>ceive that the drooling old slouch of </p><p>Lost Deer Valley could amount to so much. </p><p>The tiling looked incongruous. And yet. </p><p>with Finch in combination with the suave </p><p>Jim Black, money- an^l unscrupulousness </p><p>were hand in hand, forming the age-old </p><p>alliance against which honest men have </p><p>battled for centuries. </p><p> "Why did Black go to the county-seat?”</p><p>blurted Carlton. “That is, if he went </p><p>there?”</p><p> “I don't know. Mebbe that’ll be for</p><p>you to find out.” </p><p> “Me?”</p><p> “Yes, you. When Black seen what was</p><p>in that note to Campbell, he streaked out </p><p>That s what it looked like, anyhow. So </p><p>28 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>I'm goin’ to send that note to Campbell </p><p>again, by you. Savvy?” </p><p> The engineer thought of his wife, his</p><p>ranch and all the other elements which </p><p>claimed his attention. </p><p> “But how can I leave here?” he argued.</p><p>“Take your wife,” grunted Dolan. “The </p><p>trip'll do her good. Weather's cool now. </p><p>Take Bob Lange and Phil Johnson with </p><p>you. Take the pris’ner to the sheriff. </p><p>I’ll deputize you. It might be a good idea </p><p>for you to git acquainted down below, </p><p>anvhow.” </p><p> “Why?”</p><p> “Oh, I dunno,” said the boss vaguely.</p><p>“It may come in handy. You’re a per- </p><p>fesh’nul man. Helps business. Them two </p><p>hired men can ’tend to your ranch. No </p><p>trouble possible now. Finch is sick in bed.” </p><p>Carlton felt that he was being wafted </p><p>along in the tide of Dolan’s will, playing a </p><p>part in some larger drama than he suspecLed, </p><p>with the boss pulling the strings. And yet </p><p>he went. Dolan’s logic was good, and </p><p>Carlton w'as impelled by curiosity to visit </p><p>the county-seat, anyhow. </p><p> Thus on the next morning, with his khaki-</p><p>clad wife astride a big black horse, Carlton </p><p>started out at the head of his cavalcade. </p><p>Under the engineer’s khaki Norfolk jacket </p><p>a short-barreled Colt nestled in a holster. </p><p>Somewhere in a pocket of the girl’s skirt </p><p>was a little two-barreled derringer, but the </p><p>other two travelers wore franker weapons, </p><p>swinging over the hips of their overalls. </p><p>Only the silent prisoner was unarmed. The </p><p>party was ready for anything. </p><p> But nothing happened. No skulking</p><p>figures lurked in ambush in the long, sunny </p><p>vistas of sage-brush and greasewood, nor </p><p>in the rocks and w’ashed-out canons of the </p><p>foot-hills, nor in the miles of mesquite and </p><p>yucca-palms. Cool winds made the trip </p><p>easy, and they ambled along as if on a </p><p>picnic, taking thei* time and putting up at </p><p>scattered ranch-houses at night. Even the </p><p>prisoner caused no trouble. The others </p><p>were armed and had better horses, and </p><p>during the rests they stood guard over him. </p><p> They arrived at the county-seat late in</p><p>the morning, heading for the county' jail </p><p>behind the ramshackle old court-house, upon </p><p>whose top stood a flagpole and a decorative </p><p>wooden statue of the period of 1870, once </p><p>chastely attractive but now grimy and </p><p>lacking a nose and two hands. Horses and </p><p>buggies went up and down the unpaved </p><p>main street. Others were alined along the </p><p>hitching-racks. Wagons arrived with goods </p><p>from near-by ranches, winding pasta Yampa </p><p>mine freight-team standing in front of a </p><p>blacksmith shop, with the leaders of its </p><p>fourteen big mules jingling bells from their </p><p>collars at every movement. </p><p> Cow-punchers rode about the street or</p><p>loafed among the season’s remaining flies </p><p>where the board sidewalk jutted into the </p><p>roadway. The dingy old glass fronts of the </p><p>busy little stores advertised the wares in a </p><p>way, but the main attractions were sacks of </p><p>oats and bales of hay lying by each open </p><p>door and displaying the latest market </p><p>quotations on signs done crudely in lamp- </p><p>black. </p><p> The whole town was a living contrast.</p><p>It was dreamy and bustling, civilized and </p><p>half-savage, modem and bucolic, as if the </p><p>new West and old West were being intro- </p><p>duced to each other here. A prospector, </p><p>toting many weapons and wearing the long </p><p>hair of a Buffalo Bill, led his two burros </p><p>up to a store and mopped his broad- </p><p>brimmed sombrero. </p><p> A man in gray business clothes and a</p><p>derby hat went past him into the same store. </p><p>A cow-puncher in white angora “chaps,” </p><p>displaying guns and cartridge-belt, doffed </p><p>his hat to a schoolmaam in white, while a </p><p>yelping dog-fight around the corner brought </p><p>forth denizens from four saloons, including </p><p>two brisk Eastern commercial travelers </p><p>and three Indians wearing giddy red </p><p>blankets. </p><p> To Carlton and the girl it seemed like a</p><p>return to the outside world. They did not </p><p>realize what hermits they had been in their </p><p>little vallev. Here the roadway had trees— </p><p>actual umbrella and locust trees, while up </p><p>above there wasn't a tree for miles, except </p><p>in Carlton’s own valley. Here there wras a </p><p>garden or two, with little white-painted </p><p>houses nestling among them. The sight </p><p>made them realize the community feeling </p><p>thev had lacked. </p><p> The party registered at the old-fashioned</p><p>wooden hotel set within wide verandas, </p><p>and then Carlton and Bob Lange brought </p><p>the prisoner to the county jail, where the</p><p>lean-faced, mustached sheriff recovered </p><p>from his surprize, put the prisoner behind </p><p>bars and shot a string of questions at </p><p>Carlton. </p><p> The engineer told him a straightforward</p><p>story about the prisoner’s confession but </p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>29 </p><p>neglected to speak of the other angles, </p><p>acting on advice from Dolan. 1 he sheriff </p><p>finally scratched his head. </p><p> ••But why did the feller kill Snow?” he</p><p>asked. “What was the motive?” </p><p> “Maybe it was robbery.”</p><p> “Huh! All a freighter has is a whip an’</p><p>a chaw of terbacker! Fat chance! I guess </p><p>Dolan’s fell down. Gotta have better </p><p>motives than that to work on!” </p><p> The engineer moved a bit so the light</p><p>from the window would fall squarely on </p><p>the sheriff’s face. He was about to “spring </p><p>something,” and he wanted to observe every </p><p>move of the man’s expression. </p><p> “Snow’s murder was ordered by Jim</p><p>Black!” he announced very' quietly. </p><p> “Hey?”</p><p> The sheriff’s face underwent a trans-</p><p>formation for only a fraction of an instant, </p><p>but in that time Carlfbn learned what he </p><p>sought. There was some connection be- </p><p>tween this member of the “county gang” </p><p>and the mysterious gunman of Mirage! </p><p> “Them's strong words, young man!”</p><p>snapped the sheriff. “It might be hard to </p><p>prove! ’Course, I don’t know this Black </p><p>very well, but still he’s a citizen, and such </p><p>remarks might land you in a peck o’ </p><p>trouble!” </p><p> Carlton shrugged his shoulders.</p><p> “I didn’t charge it,” he retorted. “The</p><p>prisoner confessed it himself.” </p><p> “Who to?”</p><p> “Dan Dolan.”</p><p> “Yeh. But how many witnesses?”</p><p> “Three.”</p><p> “Humph.” The sheriff seemed to cogi-</p><p>tate for some time, looking at the floor. </p><p>“I guess we’ll have to ’vestigate this. </p><p>You’re stayin’ at the hotel? All right. </p><p>You’ll be on hand if we want you. See </p><p>you later.” </p><p> And with this easy dismissal the sheriff</p><p>went through the door into the cells, and </p><p>Carlton and his companion, feeling as if </p><p>something were wrong somewhere, walked </p><p>out of the place thoughtfully. </p><p>FACING the court-house was a </p><p>little one-story red-painted office,</p><p>and a sign over the door bore the </p><p>legend: “William J. Campbell, Attorney </p><p>at Law.” Carlton headed for this place </p><p>alone but found it locked. He learned </p><p>that Campbell would return later; so the </p><p>engineer went back toward the hotel, </p><p>which was off the main street. He turned </p><p>a comer. He passed a cottage and then </p><p>a big hav-barn. Suddenly a man came </p><p>around the barn and almost bumped into </p><p>him. It was Jim Black! </p><p> They halted in surprize. The two men</p><p>appraised each other for a second; then </p><p>Black decided to speak. </p><p> “Howdy!” he said. “What brings you</p><p>here?” </p><p> “Why, I’m just looking around the</p><p>country.” </p><p> “Huh. How far have you looked?”</p><p> “Far enough.”</p><p> The gray, calculating eyes of the killer</p><p>seemed to flash, but there was no overt act. </p><p>Black merely changed the subject a little. </p><p> “Heard you brought in a prisoner," he</p><p>commented. </p><p> “That’s correct.”</p><p> “Who was it?”</p><p> “Axel Yager.”</p><p> Though Carlton watched Black closely,</p><p>the man did not seem as surprized as he </p><p>should be.* He merely nodded his head. </p><p>“Dolan sent you?” he asked. </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “I see. Dolan sent you in. Well! Are</p><p>you aimin’ to mix into local politics any?” </p><p>The question brought the engineer’s quick </p><p>temper boiling to the surface. Carlton </p><p>took it for a sneer and resented it. He was </p><p>sick of this Jim Black person, anyhow. He </p><p>had lived under a mental strain because of </p><p>the Jim Black myth that seemed to hold a </p><p>whole population in awe, and now he had a </p><p>fascination to reach into that myth and see </p><p>what it was made of. </p><p> “What's it to you?” he flared. “I’ll do</p><p>as I-please!” </p><p> The outburst had an opposite effect to</p><p>the one expected. Black put his hands in </p><p>his pockets and seemed to cogitate. With- </p><p>out Carlton knowing it, the other was con- </p><p>sidering whether to discommode his impor- </p><p>tant affairs just then and entangle with this </p><p>pesky engineer, with possible embarrass- </p><p>ments up-country, or wait till all his present </p><p>absorbing business affairs were disposed of. </p><p> “It’s nothing to me,” he replied mildly at</p><p>length. “I was just wonderin’. I thought </p><p>it’d be better for all hands if you didn't.”</p><p> “I will be the judge of that!”</p><p> “Sure; sure. Go to it Right to the end</p><p>of the road. Go to it. Just so!” And. </p><p>waving an ironic hand, he turned and </p><p>walked away, leaving the bewildered </p><p>30 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>engineer standing there and wondering </p><p>whether Jim Black were overestimated or </p><p>underestimated. </p><p> Campbell was in when Carlton appeared</p><p>at his office later, and with the attorney was </p><p>a florid-faced, well-dressed, bald-headed </p><p>man with shrewd eyes, introduced as Lu- </p><p>cius Van Dorn, representing interests “look- </p><p>ing into the mines hereabouts.” </p><p> ‘•I’d like you to take him into your coun-</p><p>try when you go back/' said Campbell. </p><p>“He wants to look at the Yampa mine and </p><p>the other properties around there.” </p><p> The tall, pleasant-faced attorney had</p><p>read Dolan’s terse note And also an enclo- </p><p>sure concerning ihe engineer. When the </p><p>reading w-as over, he seemed very thought- </p><p>ful. </p><p> “Tell me all about it,” he invited.</p><p>Carlton looked at Van Dorn, but the lat- </p><p>ter seemed thoroughly comfortable in his </p><p>chair. Campbell caught the glance. </p><p> “Go ahead,” he said. “Van Dorn's a—</p><p>friend of mine. He wants to know the gen- </p><p>eral situation up-country, anyhow. I told </p><p>him it wfas a tough neighborhood. Maybe </p><p>you'll make him believe it.” </p><p> Still a bit wary because of the third per-</p><p>son, but accepting Campbell’s judgment, </p><p>Carlton sat down and gave a detailed ac- </p><p>count of much that had happened since </p><p>first he went into his little valley. At the </p><p>end of it Campbell whistled. </p><p> “Phew! That's a pretty mess! I can</p><p>hardly make head or tail of it! I won- </p><p>der—I wonder if Dolan’s intercepted note </p><p>has anything to do with certain powwows </p><p>the court-house bunch held last night with </p><p>some strangers. They kept the lights burn- </p><p>ing all night. There’s something big in the </p><p>wind, but—hello! Who’s there?” </p><p> A knock rapped on the door, but before the</p><p>attorney could open it the sheriff turned the </p><p>knob and walked in, followed by a chubby </p><p>deputy. The sheriff wasted no time on </p><p>formalities. </p><p> “Hey!” he bawled to Carlton. “What</p><p>sort of goin’s-on are you havin’ up in your </p><p>country, anyhow? What are you doin’? </p><p>Puttin’’ up a game on me?” </p><p> “Game?” challenged Carlton, rising from</p><p>his chair. “What are you talking about?” </p><p>“What game?” The sheriff grinned </p><p>shrewdly. “Why, bringin’ down a pris’ner </p><p>that confessed to murder because he was </p><p>bein’ choked to death! Tell me. Did Dan </p><p>Dolan strangle this man or not?” </p><p> “Dolan tried to get the truth out of</p><p>him!” snapped Carlton. </p><p> “Yell.” Sarcastically. “Truth! Why,</p><p>if I was choked like that, I'd of confessed to </p><p>killin’ President Lincoln! So would you! </p><p>Truth! Gosh! And then Dolan has the </p><p>cold crust to send this man down here as </p><p>pris’ner on a charge of murder, after Dolan </p><p>himself killed that Hackett feller with a </p><p>shotgun! Say!” The sheriff was getting </p><p>excited. “What—what sort of a slam-bang </p><p>place have you fellers got up there, anyhow'? </p><p>Ain’t there no law' or order there at all? Is </p><p>the whole district jest one floatin' insane </p><p>asylum? How’d you happen to come into </p><p>this? How’d you come into cahoots with </p><p>Dolan?” </p><p> “I’m not in cahoots with any one!” rasped</p><p>Carlton. “Dolan’s a friend of mine. Un- </p><p>derstand? He asked me to take a prisoner </p><p>down here, and I’v£ done it. If you have </p><p>anything to say to Dolan, go up there and </p><p>say it yourself!” </p><p> “Say it?” roared the sheriff. “It w'oiddn't</p><p>do no good! That feller’s got a brain like </p><p>marble! The only thing he’ll listen to is a </p><p>grand jury indictment!” </p><p> “What for?'' demanded the attorney.</p><p>“For everything! It might be for mur- </p><p>der an’ conspircy to railroad this feller, </p><p>Axel Yager, to the pen'tentiary! We’ve </p><p>had enough of Dolan in this country!” </p><p>“Well, go up and tell him so,” invited </p><p>Carlton. </p><p> The sheriff waved it away angrily.</p><p> “As for you, young feller,” he snapped,</p><p>“you’d better neglect to say much about </p><p>Jim Black promptin’ any one to kill Snow! </p><p>There’s nothin’ in it. Nothin’. See? I </p><p>I jest seen Jim Black.” </p><p> “I knew you would,” nodded Carlton.</p><p>The sheriff did not know' which way to </p><p>take the remark; so he let it go. Campbell </p><p>broke in upon him. </p><p> “Then you’re going to let Yager go?” he</p><p>asked. </p><p> “Going to? No. I done it already!”</p><p>“On his own recognizance, I suppose?” </p><p>“Sure. The district attorney advised it. </p><p>What is there to hold him on?” </p><p> Carlton’s brain w*as working fast. He</p><p>remembered how placid the prisoner had</p><p>been during his march into the countv-seat </p><p>and wondered if the man believed he was to </p><p>come among friends. Considering that a </p><p>murder charge was hanging over his head, </p><p>the man’s docility had been remarkable! </p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>3i </p><p> “Then my trip was all for nothing!” he</p><p>murmured. </p><p> “Sure. What else could it be? The</p><p>whole thing's wrong. Everything’s wrong </p><p>with Dolan in it. You tell that feller I </p><p>want to see him. If he don’t come down in </p><p>a few days, we’ll go up after him! We'll </p><p>straighten out that buzzard-roost, or we’ll </p><p>know why!” </p><p> Attorney Campbell pointed a mandatory</p><p>finger. </p><p> “Sheriff,” he said, “you may do as you</p><p>see fit. I see no reason to interfere with </p><p>your duty—or with your personal grudges. </p><p>I only want to warn you that, if the prison- </p><p>er is guilty, you have laid yourself open to </p><p>serious charges as an official of this county!” </p><p>“I’ll take the advice of the district </p><p>attorney on that. I ain’t goin’ to you for </p><p>advice; that’s certain!” </p><p> ••No,” said the attorney. “And it’s too</p><p>bad. Well, good day!” </p><p> “Hey?”</p><p> “I said good day!”</p><p> The sheriff thought it over for a moment,</p><p>then took the hint. Silence ensued. Van </p><p>Dorn, who had not stirred a muscle before, </p><p>began mopping his fat face and bare fore- </p><p>head. </p><p> “By George!” he exclaimed. “This is</p><p>the most interesting country I ever got into. </p><p>Do you stage these rows every day?” </p><p> “Every other day,” smiled Campbell.</p><p>“It’s just routine business now. Some </p><p>day —” and his face lighted a bit—“we’ll </p><p>have a new deal in this county, and then </p><p>she'll begin to be worth while.” </p><p> “What's the big trouble?” asked Van</p><p>Dorn. </p><p> “Stick-in-the-mud ideas. New-fangled</p><p>tilings—like better roads or power lines or </p><p>sewer systems—bring in new folks, new </p><p>manners of running things and possibly </p><p>higher taxes. These are the main troubles, </p><p>except for crookedness, and that's hard to </p><p>prove. If I went into these courts with </p><p>anything but iron-clad, riveted, absolutely </p><p>proven cases, I’d be laughed out of court; </p><p>so I’m stuck. The whole county’s con- </p><p>trolled—even down to the janitor in the </p><p>court-house.”</p><p> The illuminating talk struck Cariton</p><p>amidships. Carlton was one of those “new- </p><p>fangled” arrivals with “new-fangled" ideas. </p><p>It was a minor point, but it was just an- </p><p>other mite of e\idence pointing toward a </p><p>connection between the county politicians </p><p>and the slouchv old miser of Lost Deer </p><p>Valley. </p><p> “You folks stay here,” finished Camp-</p><p>bell, reaching for his hat. “I’m going over </p><p>to the court-house to look at those records </p><p>for Dolan. He must be playing some </p><p>hunch. Make yourselves at home.” And </p><p>he vanished through the door. </p><p> With Campbell well on his errand, Van</p><p>Dorn started asking shrewd questions about </p><p>Dolan’s country, keeping up the conversa- </p><p>tion while Carlton kept his eye on the big </p><p>old clock ticking on the dingy wall over a </p><p>rack of California reports and other law </p><p>books banked up from the desk. An hour </p><p>passed. Then Campbell strode through </p><p>the doonvav, laid his hat carefully over his </p><p>ink-well and turned to the other two. </p><p> “Dolan will not get his information,” he</p><p>announced. “Part of the county records </p><p>have been ‘accidentally mislaid.’ ” </p><p>LX </p><p>BACK again in the valley. With </p><p>Finch lying in a far-off hospital, </p><p>with the knowledge that Dolan's </p><p>weighty backing was always ready and </p><p>with his own strength coming up gloriously </p><p>so that he little resembled the failing man </p><p>who had arrived months before, Carlton </p><p>again took up the work of completing his </p><p>little ranch under the copper mountain, just </p><p>as if the water were tumbling down Lost </p><p>Deer Creek already. </p><p> In the upper valley, across the old</p><p>picket-fence which marked liis meadows </p><p>from Finch's, the engineer could see horses </p><p>and mules placidly- grazing, attended only </p><p>by Finch’s half-witted employee and by a </p><p>few others who came at times to help out. </p><p>To all outward signs the valley was the </p><p>abode of peace and pastoral beauty. </p><p>Autumn leaves were beginning to fail off </p><p>the oak trees: wild geese from some un- </p><p>known habitat flew southward to their </p><p>Winter homes; scudding clouds appeared in </p><p>the once-burning skies, and cool winds </p><p>soughed through pines, oaks, willows and </p><p>the long, dry grass of the meadowrs. Inside </p><p>the house the young wife kept a stove going </p><p>almost steadily, feeding it from piles of </p><p>cord-wood stacked up in a newly-built </p><p>woodshed.</p><p> Carlton worked from mom to night, re-</p><p>pairing fences, fixing old roofs, improving </p><p>the fields and putting odd hours into that </p><p>32 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>system of irrigating ditches on which he had </p><p>set his mind. With a transit he first ran </p><p>levels along the inner rim of the hills, using </p><p>one of his helpers as a rodman and placing </p><p>stakes so as to form a gentle grade for the </p><p>ditch. Then he started work, digging into </p><p>the ground, blasting away rocks and pine- </p><p>stumps and building gates and laterals to </p><p>connect the little toy ditches of the future </p><p>with the main irrigation system. He found </p><p>his muscles growing stronger daily and his </p><p>mind becoming keener. He enjoyed every </p><p>minute of it. </p><p> Sometimes Carlton went outside and sur-</p><p>veyed boundaries for others, suaightening </p><p>out disputes concerning property lines, </p><p>which were often in helter-skelter condition. </p><p>In this way he became well acquainted </p><p>throughout the district, meeting all sorts of </p><p>men, some of them belonging to the pic- </p><p>turesque days of Bret Harte and others </p><p>hailing recently from Michigan or'Missouri </p><p>or Iowa. They were the fruits of the work </p><p>of the Western railroads in offering “colo- </p><p>nist rates” and attracting the great popula- </p><p>tion of settlers which was even then be- </p><p>ginning to make the new West. Some of </p><p>them went to the cities; some to the rich </p><p>farm-lands, and some of the more adven- </p><p>turous, willing to “take a chance,” drifted </p><p>into the desert. </p><p> But Carlton gained the greatest collec-</p><p>tion of new acquaintances through his short </p><p>visit to the county-seat. After the episode </p><p>when Campbell learned that the county </p><p>records had been secreted, the lawyer had </p><p>taken the engineer about and introduced </p><p>him to acquaintances who had happened in </p><p>from all corners of the county. Some of </p><p>these met Carlton’s wife also. They were </p><p>mine-owners from the Black Rock country, </p><p>to the east; ranchers from the southern flat- </p><p>lands about Escalante Creek and W'illow </p><p>Creek; hay and grain traders from the </p><p>alfalfa tracts surrounding the county-seat, </p><p>and prospectors from all the hills and </p><p>valleys. </p><p> Campbell had not t ried to regain the lost</p><p>records. He explained that he did not wish </p><p>to seem too eager; so he put in the rest of </p><p>the time going around with Carlton. The </p><p>meeting of Van Dorn and Lhe guiding of </p><p>that stout personage and two of the latter’s</p><p>Eastern friends to Mirage were mere inci- </p><p>dents. He had left them with Dolan. </p><p> A month went by without happenings in</p><p>the valley and apparently with none out- </p><p>side. Even the sheriff had not made good </p><p>his threat to “clean Dolan out.” Carlton’s </p><p>little place was changing. A cow, a big </p><p>collie dog, two kittens, five ducks and two </p><p>ddzen chickens added life to the place and </p><p>made it more homelike. He had brought </p><p>them in from “down below,” and in his </p><p>heart he felt they constituted a sort of chal- </p><p>lenge. They made for a permanent resi- </p><p>dence, as if Jim Black and Ebenezer Finch </p><p>never existed. </p><p> And then Finch came back.</p><p> He rode by on a sorrel mare just at night-</p><p>fall one day, trailing two pack-mules laden </p><p>with supplies and bringing a nondescript </p><p>hired man in faded overalls, who paid no at- </p><p>tention to the Carlton domicile but plugged </p><p>right along for the upper ranch. Finch, </p><p>however, seemed to take an interest in the </p><p>Carlton improvements, noting the new </p><p>woodshed, chicken-coops and cow-bam with </p><p>appreciative eyes that peeped out from un- </p><p>der an antiseptic bandage. He even nodded </p><p>to Carlton, but the latter kept about his </p><p>business. </p><p> The engineer sensed that there would be</p><p>further complications when Finch arrived, </p><p>and there were. A week later Finch </p><p>strolled across Lhe meadow and approached </p><p>the little green picket-fence of the garden, </p><p>waving a white handkerchief somewhat </p><p>ironically. Carlton was washing his face </p><p>behind the kitchen and strolled forth with a </p><p>towel in his hand. </p><p> “Well, what do you want?” he de-</p><p>manded, across the fence. </p><p> “Why—I sorter felt I'd like to have a little</p><p>neighborly talk with ye,” answered Finch </p><p>with the old persuading, wheedling, whining </p><p>voice. “I thought mebbe as haow we might </p><p>be able to patch up them little troubles so’s </p><p>we'd be right friendly again. There hain’t </p><p>been a hoss or a mewl pizened since I went </p><p>away, and 1 calc’lateyou been right neigh- </p><p>borly abaout it. I thought mebbe you’d </p><p>changed your mind; so I sez to myself, sez I, </p><p>‘Let bygones be bygones;’ so I come over </p><p>here to make things friendly again.” </p><p> “That’s kind of you,’' nodded Carlton.</p><p>“Didn’t I say once I'd probably shoot you </p><p>on sight?” </p><p> FINCH waggled the white rag</p><p>isIS hastily. </p><p> “You was all excited an’ ruffled</p><p>up,” he deprecated. “A pusson's li'ble to </p><p>say anything when he’s that way. But, </p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>33 </p><p>sez I, ‘A soft answer turneth away wrath;’ </p><p>so I’m a-trvin’ to make things neighborly </p><p>again. Now abaout them hosses.” Finch </p><p>waved them away. “It wasn’t the loss, </p><p>it was only the principle of the thing. It </p><p>don’t look friendly to pizen hosses. You </p><p>kin see that yourself. But now we kin forgit </p><p>them tilings—that is, if you want to stay </p><p>here. Mebbe you don’t want to.” </p><p> Finch’s eyes showed a crafty look.</p><p> “Let me’ hear your offer,” demanded</p><p>Carlton tersely. </p><p> “Well—you been right decent abaout</p><p>that stock while I was away in the hors- </p><p>pittle; so I calc’late I kin skeer up mebbe </p><p>six thousan’ or so-” </p><p> “I paid eight thousand!” reminded Carl-</p><p>ton. </p><p> “Well, you couldn’t expect me to give</p><p>that much, considerin’ me bein’ sick with </p><p>eary-sipilis with all sorts of doctor bills and </p><p>a danged white nurse that cost me twenty- </p><p>five dollars a week. Tain’t fair. I’m a </p><p>sick man. You wouldn’t take advantage </p><p>of me bein’ sick, would you?” </p><p> The wheedling, self-pitying whine made</p><p>Carlton want to hit the man. </p><p> “Your price is too low!” he snapped.</p><p>“Well-—’tain’t exac’ly the right thing to </p><p>take advantage of a sick man that hain’t </p><p>hisself yit; it seems like things is cornin’ </p><p>sorter hard fer me—sorter hard—but ‘Live </p><p>an’ let live’ is my mottow; so mebbe I kin </p><p>skeer up eight thousan’. Mebbe I kin </p><p>bony an’ put myself into debt.” </p><p> He stopped and sighed but received no</p><p>satisfaction. </p><p> “I might be able to git even nine thou-</p><p>san’.” He glanced sideways but got no </p><p>response. “Or mebbe ten thousan’. I </p><p>dunno. I reckon a man gits old an’ fool- </p><p>ish. That land ain’t wuth ten thousan’, </p><p>but you’re a young feller, an’ mebbe it’s </p><p>better fer you to have the money than a </p><p>poor ol’ man with jest a few years to live.” </p><p>He sighed lugubriously. “It’s takin’ ad- </p><p>vantage of a poor, sick ol’ man, but-” </p><p> Carlton leaned over the fence.</p><p> “Do you know how much I’ll take?” he</p><p>shouted. </p><p> “Lemme hear it.”</p><p> “One million dollars!”</p><p> Finch’s jaw sagged.</p><p> “Why—why—that’s plum’ foolish!” he</p><p>gasped. “It’s—it’s-” </p><p> “Certainly! The whole talk is foolish!</p><p>You couldn’t get this ranch for all the </p><p>3 </p><p>money you’ve got! Now you get across </p><p>that field and stay there! Move!” </p><p> Finch’s jaw quit sagging and clamped to-</p><p>gether. </p><p> “That hain't the way to talk!” he pro-</p><p>tested. </p><p> “Git!” snapped Carlton, pointing toward</p><p>the upper ranch. </p><p> The mandate seemed to touch some hid-</p><p>den spring that threw away a mask. </p><p> “Who? Me?” The old miser trembled</p><p>for a moment. “Hey? Hey? You’ll talk </p><p>outa the other side of yer maouth pretty </p><p>soon! Dang you, I’ve hed abaout enough </p><p>of ye! You hoss-pizenin’, sneakin’, spyin’ </p><p>city-bred mongrel—I’ve stood fer yer non- </p><p>sense abaout long enough! You git aout </p><p>of this valley in ten days—the hull pack an’ </p><p>passel of ye—or I’ll give ye a taste of some- </p><p>thin’ you’ll never git over! I’ll show you! </p><p>Huh—I’ll show you!” </p><p> The engineer, at first startled by the</p><p>transformation, looked one moment into </p><p>the hectic face of Finch and then quietly </p><p>started along the fence toward the front </p><p>gate. He reached the gate before Finch was </p><p>half finished, and he reached Finch just as </p><p>the latter came to the end. Finch backed </p><p>away with his feet, but his mouth held its </p><p>ground manfully. </p><p> “Don’t you start nothin’,” he warned.</p><p>“You hit me, an’ I’ll make things so hot </p><p>you’ll wish you’d never saw the place! </p><p>Hey-” </p><p> Carlton lashed out. It was his only</p><p>comment. An instant later he regretted it. </p><p>He had not properly gaged the growth of </p><p>his arm and shoulder muscles, and the crush- </p><p>ing blow knocked Finch half-wa v across the </p><p>lane. It crashed into that snarling, leering </p><p>face just below the eye, and, when the en- </p><p>gineer lifted the dizzy man up. he saw a </p><p>bluish welt on that countenance as big as an </p><p>egg- </p><p> Carlton had struck a man just out of</p><p>the hospital. His temper disappeared in a </p><p>flood of blame for himself. He lifted the </p><p>man almost tenderly and stood him on his </p><p>feet. </p><p> “I’m sorry,’’ he said contritely, before he</p><p>saw how foolish the remark sounded. </p><p>“Sorry you’re sick, that is,” he amended. </p><p>“If you were well, now, I'd take pleasure </p><p>in knocking your head off!”</p><p> The victim gave him one look, and in that</p><p>glance the engineer saw a cold malevolence </p><p>as dangerous as the fangs of a snake. But </p><p>34 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Finch did not say anything. He didn’t </p><p>even brush himself. He simply turned away </p><p>and walked straight across the held to his </p><p>own lands, with the engineer watching until </p><p>he had passed the last oak tree up the </p><p>slope. Then Carlton finished washing his </p><p>face very thoughtfully. </p><p> The wife had noticed the incident from a</p><p>window, and so had one of the helpers. But, </p><p>by the time they arrived, it was over. Later </p><p>on the engineer became nervous. The old </p><p>strain was returning. Some one always </p><p>kept awake of nights now, guarding the </p><p>place. And yet nothing happened. </p><p> Dan Dolan arrived suddenly at the end of</p><p>a week, riding a buckskin horse that looked </p><p>piteous under the great load. The boss </p><p>came alone and unheralded, wearing an un- </p><p>accustomed khaki outfit, a broad-brimmed </p><p>hat and a pair of shining new boots just off </p><p>his counters. </p><p> “Thought I'd put up for the night,” he</p><p>announced. “May stay two nights. On </p><p>my way to Red Rock, back in the moun- </p><p>tains. Movin’ on the quiet. Meet a friend </p><p>there Thursday, mebbe. Don’t say I was </p><p>here.” </p><p> Carlton welcomed him, and the wife,</p><p>though somewhat reserved, prepared to </p><p>make him comfortable. Thus, while she </p><p>busied herself in the little kitchen for the </p><p>evening meal, the boss spread his great </p><p>bulk in a creaking chair before the open </p><p>fireplace while the engineer told him of the </p><p>latest incidents. </p><p> “I knew all about it,” was Dolan's com-</p><p>ment. “I’m watchin’ things here. Finch </p><p>seems desp’rate to git you out of the way.” </p><p> “Well, do you think he’ll carry out his</p><p>threats?” </p><p> “Nope. He’s too busy now. Got too</p><p>many irons in the fire. If he hurt you, he’d </p><p>have too much extry trouble. He’s only </p><p>trvin’ to skeer you. Mebbe that’s all he </p><p>can think of jest now.” </p><p> “Well, he won’t scare me, but I’ll admit</p><p>this thing keeps me nervous.” </p><p> “It’ll be over pretty soon,” grunted the</p><p>boss. </p><p> “What makes you think so?”</p><p> Dolan gave the engineer one of his know-</p><p>ing glances. </p><p> “Son,” he observed, “if anything hap-</p><p>pened to you, it’ll tear the county to pieces </p><p>with one big fight! For a year or more this </p><p>county's been wakin’—wakin’ like a man </p><p>from sleep. There’s a crowd here that’s </p><p>choked things for years. A combination. </p><p>It’s like a net—one strand tied to another. </p><p>I was a strand once. I got into a row with </p><p>the rest and backed out. I’d begun to see </p><p>where I was headin’. But the other strands </p><p>held strong together. They tied up with </p><p>still other strands. Only, it was all under- </p><p>ground. Couldn’t be traced. </p><p> “Then you came in. You made me look</p><p>at Finch more careful. The more I looked </p><p>the more I seen. Finch seemed like one </p><p>of the strands. Biraeby he begun to ap- </p><p>pear like a main cable. Then I dug around </p><p>some more. There was men that hated </p><p>Finch for many reasons. There was men </p><p>that backed Finch for many reasons. </p><p>Savvy? They begun to take sides. The </p><p>lines are drawin* tight. Then there’s men </p><p>that’s workin’ for the county gang, and </p><p>there’s them that’s ag’in ’em. The whole </p><p>county’s organized—both ways—and you’re </p><p>the spark that’ll mebbe set off the sky- </p><p>rockets!” </p><p> “Me?” gasped Carlton.</p><p> “You or Finch. If any tiling happens to</p><p>either one, there's goin’ to be a crash! The </p><p>whole county’s lined up! If you'd paid </p><p>much ’tendon to politics, you’d ’a* seen it!” </p><p>The wife was taking a dish of steaming </p><p>soup to the table, but she halted, petrified, </p><p>with the lamplight setting off the astonish- </p><p>ment on her pretty face. </p><p> “Great Scott!” exclaimed Carlton. “So</p><p>I’m a casus belli!” </p><p> “I dunno what that is,” said the boss,</p><p>dubiously, “but there’s goin’ to be hap- </p><p>pening around here—darned soon!” </p><p>CARLTON was thunderstruck at </p><p>the importance thrust upon him. </p><p>He began to see why he had gone </p><p>to the county-seat and why Campbell had </p><p>introduced him around to thoughtful men </p><p>from every section of the county. There </p><p>was war on from Thunder Mountain to </p><p>South End, and he was one of the chief </p><p>factors! </p><p> And yet the boss seemed to be comfort-</p><p>able about it—very. He appeared to have </p><p>the satisfied, exalted expression of the cat </p><p>that had swallowed the cream. It made </p><p>the engineer wonder whose funeral was com- </p><p>ing next. The boss was like some volcano </p><p>which, to eliminate an irritating ant-hill, </p><p>might blast away a whole province.</p><p> “You set your mind easy, ma’am,” said</p><p>Dolan to the w-ife. “There w'on’t nothin’ </p><p> ;</p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>35 </p><p>happen to you folks. If she happens, she’ll </p><p>be the other way.” </p><p> “I don’t want anything to happen,” she</p><p>responded. “Folks ought to live in peace.” </p><p>“Peace?” came Dolan’s deep voice, like </p><p>the lowing of a bull. “Yes, ma’am; we’re </p><p>goin’ to have peace in this county if we have </p><p>to turn her inside out! And I’m goin’ to </p><p>work for it!” </p><p> The boss walked over to the waiting</p><p>dinner-table with the rest and made himself </p><p>comfortable, tucking his napkin into the </p><p>collar of his soft shirt and making the nearest </p><p>knife ready for business by wiping it care- </p><p>fully on the napkin—an impolite action </p><p>caused by years of eating in a certain Chi- </p><p>nese restaurant. </p><p> “I’m gittin’ a little old, ma’am,” he con-</p><p>tinued. “I'm gittin’ tired of fights and ruc- </p><p>tions. There’s a new time cornin’ in this </p><p>land, ma’am. Please pass the butter.” </p><p>“You mean that things are going to be </p><p>entirely different?” she asked. “The— </p><p>saloons and gambling places and dance- </p><p>halls are all going to close?” </p><p> “No, ma'am. There’ll still be some devil</p><p>in human nature. Only, there’ll be less </p><p>saloons and dance-halls and more schools. </p><p>Mebbe after my time they’ll all close. </p><p>Mebbe I’d be glad of it. If 1 could close my </p><p>dance-hall now, I’d do it, ma’am, but it </p><p>wouldn’t be right.” </p><p> “Why not? Why not close it—or sell</p><p>it?” </p><p> “Suppose I did. S’pose some other sin-</p><p>ner took my place. Ran the joint. Took </p><p>charge of the girls. Are you sure he’d treat </p><p>everybody like I do—feed ’em, look after </p><p>’em when they’re sick? Are you sure I’d be </p><p>doin’ right?” </p><p> “But—it’s barbarous!” she exclaimed.</p><p>“Sure. The whole system’s wrong. I </p><p>know it now. I’m older than I was, ma’am. </p><p>But don’t you think it’s better now for me to </p><p>run the joint? If there must be crime and </p><p>riot up here, ain’t it better to have some one </p><p>around that can reg’late it?” </p><p> Carlton changed the subject hastily.</p><p>The view-points of the tough old Western </p><p>saloon-keeper and the cultured girl, whose </p><p>mother was president of a Philadelphia </p><p>branch of the Women’s Christian Temper- </p><p>ance Union, were a trifle too divergent.</p><p>Thereafter they talked on various topics </p><p>until late, and peace reigned. </p><p> As the hours wore on, Carlton began to</p><p>notice his wife thawing perceptibly toward </p><p>the boss. Though he was crude and coarse- </p><p>grained, lacking in morals except by his own </p><p>blunt code, there was a magnetism and an </p><p>inner strength which reached beyond the </p><p>lines of culture or prejudice and gripped like </p><p>a vise those upon whom he bestowed his </p><p>friendship. Here, before the firelight where </p><p>pine-logs blazed, the boss of the roughest </p><p>section of the West seemed a different man. </p><p>It was about the first home atmosphere he </p><p>was ever in, and, though he never quite over- </p><p>came his awkwardness, his soul seemed to </p><p>warm in the glow of the hearth-flames. </p><p> He spoke of Indian-fights of bygone days,</p><p>of great gold-strikes, great feuds and queer </p><p>characters, until the whole colorful, tragic, </p><p>romantic Southwest'of the old days seemed </p><p>to appe^- before them as on a screen. He </p><p>spoke with the bland innocence of a child, </p><p>seeing things with the clear prejudices of a </p><p>child’s lucid, but elemental, mind. One </p><p>man was good, another bad; a well’s water </p><p>was good or bad; a community was good </p><p>or bad. There was no neutral between </p><p>them. </p><p> Pie had picked a child out of a blizzard</p><p>and given it his scanty provisions until it </p><p>died despite his savage desire for its life. </p><p>One man he saved from a mob; another’s </p><p>life he blew out as one would snuff a candle. </p><p>He spoke of the one as blandly as the other. </p><p>And during his whole recital there was hon- </p><p>esty, honesty, honesty until the walls </p><p>seemed to ring under the spell of his down- </p><p>right soul. </p><p> “Well, what do you think of him?” asked</p><p>Carlton of his wife later, when the stars </p><p>were shining coldly into their little dark up- </p><p>stairs room. </p><p> “I pity him!” she responded. “I never</p><p>saw such a fine man gone to waste! I pity </p><p>him with all my heart!” </p><p> “Well, don’t tell him that,” he advised,</p><p>sleepily; and then he forgot all about it. </p><p> Carlton awroke with a start and peered</p><p>about the dark room. </p><p> “WHiat was that?” he wdiispered, but the</p><p>ticking of the little alarm-clock was the </p><p>only response. * </p><p> He strained to hear better. A cricket</p><p>chirped somewhere outside, and a watcher </p><p>in the dining-room rustled a newspaper. </p><p>The engineer, feeling foolish, slid back into </p><p>dreamland.</p><p> Five minutes later he awoke again,</p><p>clutching at the coverlets. Far away, faint </p><p>to his ears, came a vague but persistent </p><p>36 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>drumming, drumming, drumming that could </p><p>mean but one thing. </p><p> “Horses!” he gasped. “They're going</p><p>through the pass! Hear it?” He shook </p><p>his wife out of her slumbers. “Hear that?” </p><p>She came to consciousness slowly. </p><p> “I hear something,” she said at last,</p><p>"ft sounds like animals running.” She </p><p>stayed quiet for a time. “They’re com- </p><p>ing. not going!” </p><p> Carlton sprang out of bed.</p><p> “Maybe Finch is up to something!” he</p><p>surmised. </p><p>"They’re coming!” she reiterated. “Wait! </p><p>I heard a metallic sound. They’re going </p><p>past the lane. I wonder what time it is.” </p><p>Carlton lit a match and peered into the </p><p>clock. </p><p> “Three in the morning,” he announced.</p><p>He went to ihe window and looked out, </p><p>seeing nothing but the cold stars and the </p><p>old copper mountain whose black silhouette </p><p>loomed high above. And still the eery </p><p>drumming continued. Carlton at length </p><p>thought lie could almost hear the creak </p><p>of saddle-leather. He grasped his trousers </p><p>and boots and pulled them on. He picked </p><p>up his Winchester and got ready to start </p><p>down-stairs, but, while he was organizing, </p><p>the noise of the spectral cavalcade grew </p><p>fainter and fainter until only the sound of </p><p>the cricket could be heard, seeming to </p><p>chuckle over the mystery. </p><p> “It seems to be over,” announced the</p><p>wife. “They didn’t stop here. They went </p><p>up the valley. Better get back to bed. I </p><p>guess it won’t affect us.” </p><p> “I'm not so sure!” responded Carlton.</p><p>“There’s something fishy here. It sounded </p><p>like a troop of cavalry—and Dolan’s in </p><p>this house. I wonder if they’re after him. </p><p>Great Scott, it may be the sheriff with a </p><p>posse, putting up at Finch’s for the night!’' </p><p>Carlton grabbed all his clothes off a chair </p><p>and began to move as if he were through </p><p>with sleeping. </p><p> “What are you going to do?” she asked</p><p>at length. </p><p> “Why, I’m going to look into this tiling!</p><p>There's some monkey-business going on </p><p>and-” </p><p>SfT” THE muffled crack of a shot came </p><p>to his ears from far across the upper</p><p>E_J fields. He ran to the window, but- </p><p>toning his shirt. There was a quick flash </p><p>from the brush near Finch’s house—then </p><p>another. Then another. The far-away </p><p>reports began to roll like musketry. There </p><p>was a faint, stifled yell—then a fusillade </p><p>that sounded like tire-crackers. </p><p> A pin-point of steady flame arose from a</p><p>dark blotch that stood where a Finch barn </p><p>ought to be. It grew ^ bit. Then a lurid </p><p>yellow glare sprang up from the place as if </p><p>all the hay had caught lire at once. Horses </p><p>started stampeding in the distant fields, </p><p>thundering their hoofs as they milled around </p><p>inside their fences. The glare swung high, </p><p>illuminating the sides of the tumble-down </p><p>houses and barns. </p><p> Carlton jumped down-stairs two steps</p><p>at a time, holding the Winchester. He </p><p>rushed upon the tenant less dining-room, </p><p>where the hearth-embers were still glow- </p><p>ing and a Ugh ted lamp stood upon the red </p><p>table-cloth. He looked out of the door. </p><p>One of the hired men was standing outside </p><p>the threshold, smoking a corn-cob ami </p><p>looking across the field. </p><p> “Hello!” lie ejaculated. “You up?</p><p>Looks as if there’s trouble over there? </p><p> “Where’s Dolan?” demanded the engi-</p><p>neer. </p><p> “Him? Oh, mebbe he’s asleep. He</p><p>sleeps sound, Dolan does. No use to go </p><p>after him. Let him sleep.” </p><p> Carlton grunted assent and walked for-</p><p>ward. swinging open his yard gate and </p><p>making for the oak groves on the upper </p><p>part of liis ranch. He was filled with </p><p>curiosity. It was a riot, nothing less. A </p><p>riot in his valley! What did it mean?’’ </p><p> He walked past the dark willow's of the</p><p>creek and neared his boundary', where the </p><p>half-built irrigation ditch lay. The shots </p><p>wrere keeping up, some singly and some in </p><p>gusts, and. as he went nearer, he could see </p><p>the silhouettes of men dodging about in </p><p>the light of the crackling fire. </p><p> He came to the ditch and nearly fell in.</p><p>He started walking along it cautiously. A </p><p>horse whickered from an oak grove to the </p><p>left. He turned and approached it and </p><p>finally' discerned the dark forms of horses </p><p>massed under a tree. He put out his hand </p><p>and patted a soft muzzle, noting the bridle. </p><p> A cry came to his ears. He sensed that a</p><p>form was staggering across the ditch and </p><p>approaching the horses. He held his rifle </p><p>read}- and walked toward the man warily. </p><p>The man's breath seemed to be sucking in</p><p>like a broken-down pump, but even in his </p><p>pain he noticed the engineer. </p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>37 </p><p> “Hey!” he yelled. “Keep away! Who</p><p>are vou?” </p><p> “I’m Carlton. I own this place.”</p><p> “So did I!” snarled the other, with an</p><p>unearthly note of triumph in his voice. </p><p>“But I’m even now! I got him! Dang </p><p>his hide to Tophet, I got him—at last— </p><p>oh!” He started gurgling. </p><p> Carlton bent over him quickly and struck</p><p>a match. </p><p> “Tom Fulton!” he gasped. “You’re</p><p>shot, man—your shirt’s all red!” </p><p> “Yeh!” snarled Fulton. “He got me.</p><p>He sat up in bed an’ shot till he keeled over. </p><p>But we got him. Oh!” And lie put his </p><p>hand to his chest. </p><p> Carlton knew whom Fulton had shot.</p><p>In his mind he visualized the murderous </p><p>pistol-battle in Finch’s old shanty, with a </p><p>pack of vengeful demons spurting hot lead </p><p>through the dark doorway and the miser </p><p>dying as he had lived—alone in a corner. </p><p> But Carlton heeded his duty to a helpless</p><p>man. The poor monomaniac who could </p><p>not forget an injury lay on Lhe ground, </p><p>gasping with pain. The engineer picked </p><p>him up gently and tried to lead him to </p><p>a horse, but the man collapsed. Carlton </p><p>dragged him a little way but soon noted </p><p>that others were coming across the dark </p><p>fields. The firing had ceased. The sides </p><p>of the old bam were tumbling down and </p><p>the flames were reducing. It all seemed to </p><p>be over. </p><p> Another vague human form came toward</p><p>the horses, then some more. Carlton called </p><p>for assistance and explained who he was, </p><p>to make sure of them. Mysterious hands </p><p>grasped Fulton and put him over a horse. </p><p>Other ghostly hands lashed him into place. </p><p>Vague, bashful voices bade the engineer </p><p>take Fulton to his home, promising to </p><p>summon medical aid immediately. Then </p><p>the dark forms sprang to horses and gal- </p><p>loped away—presumably to hasten the </p><p>medical aid. </p><p> Leading the horse and stumbling forward,</p><p>Carlton came to his house and yelled toward </p><p>the closed door. Every window was il- </p><p>luminated, but he did not notice that. </p><p>The door swung open, and his wife and the </p><p>two helpers appeared. And then he saw </p><p>Dolan. </p><p> The boss was seated at the table, fully</p><p>dressed, with account-books and papers </p><p>and rough filing-cabinets piled hi^h in </p><p>front of him on the red table-cloth. Papers </p><p>were everywhere—yellow, white, blue and </p><p>green—littering the whole table and even </p><p>the floor. The boss seemed engrossed in </p><p>them to the exclusion of every'thing else. </p><p> Carlton and the others took Fulton to a</p><p>room, after which the engineer rushed to </p><p>join Dolan. Then he stood irresolute. </p><p>The boss looked as if he had struck the </p><p>treasure of the ages. </p><p> “Gosh!” he mumbled.</p><p> Then he struck another find, and his eyes</p><p>opened still wider. </p><p> “What is it?” interrupted Carlton.</p><p>. The boss looked up like some old lion </p><p>holding venison in his paw and loath to be </p><p>disturbed. </p><p> “It’s the evidence,” he snapped. He</p><p>checked himself and explained. “The evi- </p><p>dence. Savvy? Somebody took it from the </p><p>Finch place and left it here accidental.” </p><p> “A coincidence, of course,” said Carlton</p><p>with gentle irony. </p><p> “Sure. Coincidence. But it’s jest</p><p>enough coincidence to bust open this </p><p>county from end to end! It’s changed the </p><p>whole deal. You thought you was in a </p><p>fight for your ranch. I thought I was in a </p><p>county political fight. Son, do you know </p><p>where the trail leads to?” </p><p> “Where?”</p><p> “Into the gen’ral offices of a big railroad,</p><p>into the Department of the Interior and </p><p>mebbe into the halls of the United States </p><p>Congress!” </p><p>X </p><p>“WHAT?” shouted the engineer. </p><p> The boss lit a black cigar having</p><p>the dimensions and about the smell </p><p>of a sewer-pipe. </p><p> “Abso-lutely!” he responded. “There’s</p><p>enough dynamite in them papers to rock </p><p>the State!” </p><p> Carlton sank into a chair while his wife</p><p>joined him from the sick-room. </p><p> “W'hat’s the general idea of it all?” he</p><p>demanded. “What's happened? Begin at </p><p>the beginning.” </p><p> “Well, let's see. Near as I can make out,</p><p>there’s a plan up in Congress to build a big </p><p>dam across Thunder Mountain Creek for </p><p>irrigation. There was a lot of talk about </p><p>it some time ago, but it all died down. I’d </p><p>clean forgot about it. Then this year, </p><p>while Congress wjas fiddlin’ over bills, some- </p><p>body started the Thunder Mountain thing</p><p>again. Then a ’lectric comp’ny seen a </p><p>Adventure </p><p>chance for a power project, and the railroad </p><p>wanted to build a supply-line. Also </p><p>wanted to tap the country when the land </p><p>was irrigated and the settlers came in. </p><p>Savvy? Everything seemed to come at </p><p>once—the gosh-dangdest proj&gt;osition the </p><p>county ever seen!” </p><p> The boss’s eyes grew mystic, and he blew</p><p>a dozen smoke-rings. “She’d irrigate the </p><p>land from Thunder Mountain clear down to </p><p>Escalante. She'd bring in a new deal all </p><p>around. New settlers. Homes. Fruit- </p><p>ranches. Power lines. Roads. Schools. </p><p>Why, in five years real-estate here’d be </p><p>sellin’ in Chicago and New York, like they </p><p>do in Los Angeles. Hut all this was on </p><p>the quiet. Congress hadn’t done nothin’ </p><p>yet, and neither had the railroad. Or the </p><p>power company. They was only considerin’ </p><p>it, and they didn’t want it to git out so’s </p><p>to start land-speculation. </p><p> "And then somebody leaked. I git this</p><p>from Finch’s papers, but some things is </p><p>mixed up. It may be congressman, rail- </p><p>road man or map-maker; 1 dunno. I only </p><p>know that right away some influence </p><p>started buy-in’ up all the land in sight, on </p><p>the quiet. Buy-in’, beggin’ or stealin’. I </p><p>knew there was somethin’ goin’ on, but I </p><p>couldn't lay my finger on it. Bimeby I seen </p><p>that the county gang was in it. Later on </p><p>I begun to see Finch and Black in it. </p><p>Finch seemed to be the main purchasin’- </p><p>agent for the crowd. </p><p> “Mebbe they figgered nobody’d suspcct</p><p>him. Only, he couldn't play square, him </p><p>and Black. They slugged people with </p><p>guns, mortgages or grocery' bills. Bimeby </p><p>they had all sorts of land around the </p><p>foot-hills here. Meantime, they held up </p><p>their own crowd. They bought cheap and </p><p>padded the expcnse-accounts. That was </p><p>Finch all through. He jest grabbed. Could- </p><p>n’t play square even on a crooked deal. </p><p>Just wasn’t built that way. Savvy?” </p><p> "Yes, I understand. But let’s get this</p><p>straight. How much actual crime is un- </p><p>covered?” </p><p> “Huh—look here. Suppose some con-</p><p>gressman was makin’ money out of it? </p><p>S pose they was aimin’ to fix high prices </p><p>for rights of way for the Gov’ment or the </p><p>railroad or power comp’ny? S’po&gt;e there </p><p>was others mixed up in Finch’s or Black’s </p><p>killin’s? S’pose Finch didn’t have to pay' </p><p>taxes on them lands he held? S’pose the</p><p>records in the recorder’s office was ‘mislaid’ </p><p>so’s the County gang wouldn’t have to </p><p>pay for taxes either? S’pose it was proved </p><p>that dummy homesteaders was workin’ </p><p>everywhere? S pose the whole county was </p><p>jest loot, loot, loot? I)’ye see where the </p><p>trail leads? Crime? Why, there's enough </p><p>crime to keep the jails busy' for twenty </p><p>years!” </p><p> “Phew!” w'histled Carlton. “And W’hat</p><p>are y’ou going to do with all this evidence?” </p><p> “Give it to Van Dorn. He’s a Gov’ment</p><p>man. He was ordered out here to snoop </p><p>around and look into things. Him and me </p><p>had a long powwow. He seen all that I </p><p>seen, but we couldn’t get no further. Even </p><p>the county records was closed to us. We </p><p>milled around like stray burros, me waichin’ </p><p>the trails here and him diggin' up things </p><p>outside. Finally Van Dorn says the only </p><p>way to git anything was to git into Finch's </p><p>house and look over his papers. But there </p><p>wasn’t no way to do that except by breakin’ </p><p>the law.” </p><p> Dolan’s bland explanation made the</p><p>engineer smile. </p><p> “I see,” he nodded. “And then, just</p><p>by luck, a lot of crazy hoodlums raided </p><p>Finch’s place and took out the papers by </p><p>accident.” </p><p> “Jest so,” nodded the boss. “Coin-</p><p>cidence. Tom Fulton got over his bullet </p><p>and worked up his revengeful sperrits. </p><p>Then there w as others got het up, till finally </p><p>they all got so darned mad they jest couldn’t </p><p>stand it any longer. Savvy?” </p><p> ‘‘Yes, I savvy,” admitted Carlton. “I</p><p>savvy it all. Quite a wonderful coincidence. </p><p>And then your being here tonight—a </p><p>miracle!” </p><p> “Sure it was. I jest stopped here on my</p><p>way beyond to see a man. Now I’ve </p><p>changed myr mind; but if questions is ever </p><p>asked I can show- him for a witness. </p><p>Savvy?” </p><p> “Yes, I understand,” said Carlton gently,</p><p>and then he sighed. </p><p> Through whisky, chicanery^, arson, riot</p><p>and manslaughter his salvation had come, </p><p>and, though lie knew that the valley of his </p><p>home was saved to him for keeps, he won- </p><p>dered now if the price had not gone far </p><p>beyond him. The boss was watching him, </p><p>curious and puzzled, as if trying to interpret </p><p>the expression in Carlton’s face and that of </p><p>his wife. </p><p> “Didn’t I do right?” he demanded with</p><p>the simple directness of a child.</p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>39 </p><p> The engineer countered.</p><p> “Do you think this riot will kill off the</p><p>chances for the dam?” </p><p> “Not much! And, when she’s built, she’ll</p><p>be built fair and square. The water’ll </p><p>come down clean to a land that’s clean.” </p><p>“Well—in that case, I guess it’s worth </p><p>the price. I wonder who’s going to own </p><p>Finch’s place now?” </p><p> “I dunno. Mebbe I will. Finch prob’ly</p><p>didn’t leave a will or have any heirs; so the </p><p>land’ll go back to the State. Mebbe I’ll </p><p>buy it.” </p><p> Carlton’s mind took another tack.</p><p> “Did you run across the trail of Jim</p><p>Black?” he asked, pointing to the papers. </p><p> “Sure. Tracks all over the place. All</p><p>sorts of money passed between ’em.” </p><p> “From Finch to Black, of course.”</p><p> “No. That’s the queer part of it. From</p><p>Black to Finch!” </p><p> “Why, Black didn’t have any money!”</p><p>“That’s what I thought. But look at </p><p>them receipt-books.” </p><p> Carlton leaned over and began pawing</p><p>at the papers. Everything was there— </p><p>every transaction of Finch's for years back, </p><p>marked down with a scrupulousness that </p><p>amounted to a mania. He even had </p><p>duplicates of the receipts he gave, and </p><p>these showed the trail of Jim Black. The </p><p>more Carlton looked the more interested </p><p>he became, until at length his wife tapped </p><p>him on the shoulder. He looked up. The </p><p>darkness was gone. The lamp was burning </p><p>dimly, and the skies outside held the blue </p><p>haze of dawn. Dolan was sleeping in his </p><p>chair and snoring gently, with a smile on </p><p>his face as if he were living again in the </p><p>heroic days of his youth. The red embers </p><p>of the fireplace had turned to gray ashes. </p><p> “Fulton is dead,” she announced very</p><p>quietly. </p><p> “Dead?”</p><p> Carlton stared at his wife, then looked</p><p>out of the window to where a bird on the </p><p>limb of a tree was just starting its first song </p><p>of the day, bidding the world to waken </p><p>to life and sunshine. </p><p> The wife sighed.</p><p> “Why should it. be like this?” she asked</p><p>helplessly. “It seems there’s been nothing </p><p>but tragedy since we came.” </p><p> He took her hand.</p><p> “Maybe it’s part of the price we must</p><p>pay,” lie said gently.</p><p> “The price of our living here? If I</p><p>thought that, I wouldn’t stay another </p><p>minute!” </p><p> “No. It isn’t the price for us. It’s a</p><p>bigger thing than us. We’re in it, but we’re </p><p>not the thing itself. It’s just the price </p><p>of civilization, girl—working up through </p><p>tragedies to happiness. Nothing is born </p><p>without a pang, and so these things are </p><p>natural.” </p><p>DAN DOLAN woke them an hour </p><p>later, when the sun was streaming </p><p>slantwise through the tidy curtains. </p><p>The engineer was sunk in a great chair, </p><p>and she was perched on its broad leathern </p><p>arm and sleeping peacefully on his shoulder. </p><p>The boss was loath to spoil the picture, but </p><p>the papers littering the room cried for </p><p>action. </p><p> At Dolan’s yell the couple cajne to life,</p><p>and the embarrassed wife rushed off to </p><p>attend to her belated kitchen duties. </p><p>Carlton arose to bring in some wood. </p><p> “What are you going to do now?” he</p><p>asked as he stretched himself. </p><p> “Goin’ to bring this stuff into town.</p><p>Van Dorn’s there. You better come with </p><p>me. Mebbe there’ll be somethin’ doin’.” </p><p> Thus within an hour the young engineer</p><p>and the old saloon-keeper loped through </p><p>the pass and into the long road that led </p><p>through bleak and barren lands to the </p><p>tumble-down settlement of Mirage. </p><p> Van Dom was there, and so were many</p><p>others, who drank at Dolan’s bar or played </p><p>cards at tables or lounged about the </p><p>hitcliing-racks outside and swrapped yarns. </p><p>Except for a subdued air of excitement, </p><p>it appeared like a casual, go-as-you-please </p><p>gathering of strays from every section of </p><p>the lulls and valleys of the desert county. </p><p>Here was a prospector with frayed clothes </p><p>and heavy beard; yonder, a ranch-owner </p><p>wearing expensive high boots and Stetson </p><p>hat. Some had store-clothes, with car- </p><p>tridge-belts and pistols at their hips, while </p><p>others displayed the sheepskin “chaps” </p><p>of the range country further south. Some </p><p>were slouchv and dirty; some clean, and </p><p>still others bore the fresh dust of the road. </p><p> When the boss arrived, every face was</p><p>turned toward him, but beyond a casual </p><p>nod to all and a short conversation with a </p><p>miner eager to impart some news, he </p><p>ignored the gathering for the time and </p><p>strode with his gunny-sack full of docu- </p><p>ments into the back of his store, wjhere </p><p>40</p><p>Adventure </p><p>the bald and smiling Van Dora was waiting </p><p>with his two companions. </p><p> Dolan slammed book after book and file</p><p>upon file to the desk in back of liis clerk's </p><p>cage. </p><p> “You keep 'em,” he advised. “If any-</p><p>thing happens, hide ’em. The whole </p><p>county’s heard about this Finch trouble, </p><p>and she's up in arms. Visitors is expected. </p><p>Carlton, you explain things to Van Dorn. </p><p>I'm goin inside.” And he strode into his </p><p>dance-hall. </p><p> Every one lined up to the bar noisily</p><p>at a loud invitation from Dolan, but within </p><p>the half-darkened cage the bald-headed </p><p>Government man attacked his papers as </p><p>eagerly as a fisherman with tlie prize trout </p><p>of the year. </p><p> “But,” he admitted at length in j&gt;er-</p><p>plexity, “there’s one thing 1 can't under- </p><p>stand. and 'that’s this man Black. Here's </p><p>a batch-of receipts where he’s given all sorts </p><p>of money to Finch. See—received of Jim </p><p>Black, ten thousand dollars; Black, five </p><p>thousand—forty thousand—eighteen thou- </p><p>sand. Where did the man get all the </p><p>money? Who was he agent for? Some </p><p>of these receipts are three years old. Most </p><p>of them are very recent. What does it </p><p>mean?” </p><p> “It’s all beyond me,” admitted Carlton.</p><p>And then he straightened suddenly. </p><p> Into his ears came a noise like distant</p><p>thunder, made by the pounding hoofs of </p><p>trotting horses and coming nearer con- </p><p>stantly. He wrent to the door and looked </p><p>out. Swinging up the street came a score </p><p>of horsemen riding close together, with </p><p>spurs and bits jingling, rifles slung over </p><p>shoulders and pistol-butts protruding from </p><p>many holsters. </p><p> “The sheriff!” gasped Carlton.</p><p> Van Dorn jumped and thrust his loot</p><p>under a heap of tents and blankets. Carl- </p><p>ton hastened into the dance-hall, where </p><p>the boss stood in front of the bar and </p><p>chatted with a coterie of friends as if </p><p>nothing were happening. The cavalcade </p><p>drew up to the building. The loungers </p><p>on the porch ambled in through the door, </p><p>but not a comment was made bv any one. </p><p>The atmosphere* seemed charged with </p><p>something quiet and chilly and deadly. </p><p>In spite of the low murmur of conversation, </p><p>there seemed to be a silence that shrieked </p><p>through the big board dance-hall. </p><p> And then the sheriff came in.</p><p> ,He stamped through the doorway at the</p><p>head of an armed delegation that acted </p><p>like a company of militia taking charge of a </p><p>rioters’ headquarters, pointing no weapons </p><p>but lining up along the front wall and </p><p>standing ready for any tiling. The other </p><p>groups of silent men massed behind Dolan </p><p>toward the rear of the room. </p><p> The sheriff advanced directly toward the</p><p>towering boss of Mirage. </p><p> “i’ve come for an accountin'," he an-</p><p>nounced, holding hands warily at his hips. </p><p>“What sort o' madhouse you runnin’ </p><p>up here? You're a deputy. Now </p><p>speak!” </p><p> It was very direct, and it put the boss</p><p>on the defensive instantly. He stood there, </p><p>the largest man in the place and the center </p><p>of all eyes, figuring on how to avoid being </p><p>bullied and yet prevent a holocaust which </p><p>might exterminate the whole roomful. It </p><p>was a hair-trigger situation, and the boss </p><p>held his temper. </p><p> “As how?’’ he inquired.</p><p> “How? With killin's all around the place?</p><p>Murder an' arson everywhere? How about </p><p>Snow? How about Hackett? How about </p><p>Finch? Yeh, we heard about Finch this </p><p>mornin’ on the road. That’s why we camc </p><p>faster. How about it?” </p><p> “Search me.” demurred Dolan. “I didn't</p><p>kill him. 1 wasn’t even there.” </p><p> “Yeh? Well, why didn’t you arrest them</p><p>that was there? Hey? You’re a deputy </p><p>sheriff, ain't jfou? What kind o’ game you </p><p>playin’, anyhow?” </p><p> The boss had stood about enough. He</p><p>did not want to start hostilities between </p><p>these masses of armed men, but bis choleric </p><p>temper was straining to the breaking-point. </p><p>He tried hard to fight it down, and at last </p><p>he succeeded. </p><p> “Mike!” he bawled to his bartender.</p><p>“Where’s my deputy’s star?” </p><p> “I dunno. Mebbe she’s in the nail-box.</p><p>No—no; I remember now'; you used it </p><p>to plug a leak in the drain-pipe durin' that </p><p>rain. She's been out there-” </p><p> “Go git it!”</p><p> Somebody snickered. Some one else</p><p>laughed outright. Even the most stem- </p><p>faced deputies smiled. The incident sapped </p><p>the tension from the atmosphere instantly, </p><p>though the sheriff still stood like a figure of </p><p>wrath. </p><p> Mike returned in a few seconds, via the</p><p>rear door. </p><p>The Boss of Mirage</p><p>4i </p><p> “I can’t git it!” lie shouted. “She’s</p><p>soldered in!” </p><p> “Rip off the whole danged pipe!” snorted</p><p>the boss. “Gimme that star!” </p><p> Rasping sounds ensued outside, and then</p><p>the bartender returned with a piece of pipe </p><p>with a deputy sheriff’s star stuck tightly </p><p>in the joint. Dolan grabbed it and thrust </p><p>it into the hands of the scowling sheriff. </p><p> “I resign!” roared the boss. “I ain’t</p><p>vour danged deputy no more. Here’s my </p><p>star!” </p><p> The sheriff dashed the pipe to the polished</p><p>floor. </p><p> “That’s enough o’ that!” he snarled.</p><p>“This ain't play!” He stopped and straight- </p><p>ened and pointed a grim forefinger. “In </p><p>the name of the State of California, I arrest </p><p>ye for the murder of Elijah Hackett an’ </p><p>for complic’ty in the murder of Ebenezer </p><p>Finch!” </p><p> “What makes you think I was connected</p><p>with the Finch thing?” asked Dolan, </p><p>almost purring. </p><p> “Aw, you got a finger in everything up</p><p>here. Don’t you think I git any infor- </p><p>mation from anybody? Huh—better keep </p><p>yourself under arrest. It’ll save trouble!” </p><p>The face of the boss was thunderous. </p><p>“You arrest me?” he roared, clenching </p><p>his mighty' fist and advancing straight </p><p>toward the backing sheriff despite the armed </p><p>men behind him. “You arrest me, hey? </p><p>Well, now you listen to me. You figgered </p><p>I was gittin’ too close on your trail, so you’d </p><p>grab me before I done any damage, didn’t </p><p>you? When you heard Finch was raided, </p><p>you rode hell-bent for fear somebody might </p><p>find out too much—didn’t you? Well, </p><p>you’re too slow! You and your gang is </p><p>cooked, finished and done forever! You’re </p><p>through!” </p><p>VAN DORN, who had stood quietly </p><p>watching the others, now came for- </p><p>ward. His attitude was offhand </p><p>and conversational, as if there wasn’t a fire- </p><p>arm or an excitable person in the room. </p><p> “In the name of the United States Gov-</p><p> ernment,” he announced easily, showing a</p><p> badge on his vest, “I hereby arrest the</p><p> sheriff of this county for complicity in a</p><p> wholesale plot to swindle homesteaders out</p><p> of their lands!”</p><p> A dozen rifles almost fell from paralyzed</p><p> hands. A score of men stood as if the earth</p><p> had opened beneath them. The petrified</p><p>sheriff’s jawr sagged and his eyes bulged</p><p>with amazement, while his face turned </p><p>white. </p><p> “What—what are you givin’ me?” he</p><p>fenced. </p><p> “You know w'hat it is,” said Van Dorn</p><p>easily. “It’s about the Thunder Mountain </p><p>dam and the railroad. We might as well </p><p>speak about it openly now. The bill has </p><p>gone to Congress.-’ </p><p> “ ’Rah!” j elled some one.</p><p> Somebody else joined in and started a</p><p>chorus of joyful profanity. The stricken </p><p>deputies lowered their rifles and stared. </p><p>They were regular deputies or political </p><p>friends of the sheriff or adventurous citi- </p><p>zens hastily sworn in for the anticipated </p><p>trump-card raid. The latter class started </p><p>for the door, milling into another group </p><p>of the sheriff’s men who were standing over </p><p>the threshold. </p><p> “Hey!” yelled Van Dorn suddenly.</p><p>“Stop that man!” </p><p> “Jim Black!” gasped Carlton.</p><p> The man had been with the incon-</p><p>spicuous group at the doorway all along, </p><p>unobserved until nowr. He had started to </p><p>disappear, but Van Dorn had been noting </p><p>him from the first. </p><p> The Government man strode fonvard. So</p><p>did Carlton. Black saw he could not jam </p><p>through the throng quickly enough; so he </p><p>turned. His hand whipped to his side. A </p><p>pistol flashed out and pointed straight at Van </p><p>Dorn. The men beside the latter jumped </p><p>out of the line of fire, while those behind </p><p>Jim Black also scattered. Dolan speeded </p><p>behind his bar, but nobody noticed him. </p><p> “Quit that! \rou’re under arrest!” yelled</p><p>the white-faced Government man to Black. </p><p>“Put up that gun!” </p><p> “Take me!” invited Black.</p><p> He was smiling through slit eyes and</p><p>o-ouching fonvard like a cat about to spring. </p><p> The Government man wras plucky enough,</p><p>but the pistol-barrel w-as unwavering, and </p><p>his round face began to give forth per- </p><p>spiration. He decided to spar for time. </p><p> “So this is wrhere you’ve come to!” he</p><p>remarked, trying to appear easy. “We’ve </p><p>searched the wrhole United States for you, </p><p>Joe Barton. A man doesn’tvtake a hundred </p><p>thousand dollars from an Army transport </p><p>without the Government keeping after him </p><p>pretty fine. Pretty fine! Don’t you re- </p><p>member me? The fellow who checked </p><p>your accounts in San Francisco before you </p><p>42 </p><p>Adventure</p><p>breezed away three years ago? Come on; </p><p>drop that gun. Quit it!” </p><p> “Take me!” challenged Black, backing</p><p>away slowly. </p><p> Men were getting behind chairs, tables,</p><p>walls, the bar and everything else handy. </p><p>The sheriff was flattening himself against </p><p>the picture of a prize-fighter. His deputies </p><p>had forgotten their errand and were scat- </p><p>tered all over the place. Carlton was a </p><p>little to one side of Van Dorn, standing his </p><p>ground and wondering just what to do. </p><p>He did not want to produce a pistol and </p><p>perhaps start something; neither did he </p><p>trust Black and his weapon. He therefore </p><p>kept his hands near his sides and awaited </p><p>developments. Black looked like a crouch- </p><p>ing panther. </p><p> And yet the bald-headed Van Dorn,</p><p>palpably unarmed, started to walk forward </p><p>while holding his empty hands out. He had </p><p>made his decision. He was a Government </p><p>man and knew the power and weight of the </p><p>great, relentless moral forces behind him. </p><p>He figured that, as Black had been a Gov- </p><p>ernment man, he fully realized the useless- </p><p>ness of opposing those forces, thus being </p><p>amenable to a peaceful arrest. For Black </p><p>the jig. was up. Even he could see it. Van </p><p>Dorn had not been fed full of Black’s repu- </p><p>tation as a gunman; neither did he believe </p><p>that any man could kill an unarmed one in </p><p>cold blood. Therefore, part in earnest and </p><p>part as a bluff, he laid his human fears </p><p>aside and advanced. </p><p> “Look out!” came a yell from the back</p><p>of the room. </p><p> Black had backed to the threshold. The</p><p>Government man still walked forward, a </p><p>little overconfident, a little overeager to </p><p>make the arrest, with his hand stretched </p><p>out persuasively for Black's gun. For a </p><p>moment the silent crowd wondered if the </p><p>arrest were not to be made after all. Black </p><p>had a hunted look on his face. Then his </p><p>expression changed. Van Dorn took an- </p><p>other step. </p><p> “Hey!” yelled an awed man. “Stop</p><p>him!” </p><p> But it was too late. Even though</p><p>Black could not kill an unarmed man who </p><p>walked forward publicly with hands up. </p><p>Black could stop this Federal agent long </p><p>enough to get away, and he did. Black’s </p><p>pistol blazed a stream of fire right into Van </p><p>Dora’s shoulder. The roar of the shot </p><p>galvanized the room. The Government </p><p> man, wounded purposely, yelled and stag-</p><p>gered. Then Black leaped backward. </p><p> Instantly Carlton jerked out his pistol</p><p>and fired madly. The gun kicked in his </p><p>hand. Black half turned and brought the </p><p>muzzle of that deadly pistol toward him. </p><p>One instant, one quiver of Black’s muscles, </p><p>and the engineer might be in eternity. </p><p> Suddenly a blast of heat and lead roared</p><p>across Carlton’s face, stunning him and </p><p>making his ears*ring. The gust of fire blew </p><p>away part of the doorway and hurled Black </p><p>straight backward like a piece of paper in a </p><p>heavy wind. A stream of acrid smoke </p><p>blurred the entrance, and, when it cleared </p><p>away, the boss, behind uhe bar, was taking </p><p>an empty shell from a shotgun. </p><p> Black, lying queerly on the porch, was</p><p>a dead man. </p><p> Carlton took one look and then turned</p><p>away, shuddering, to where Van Dora was </p><p>nursing his shoulder. The sheriff was ap- </p><p>proaching the bar with his hands up. The </p><p>boss jerked his thumb to somebody, and </p><p>that man took the sheriff’s armament away; </p><p>after which Dolan came from his trenches </p><p>and approached the suffering Van Dorn. </p><p> “Say!” he asked. “I want to know</p><p>somethin’. This feller, Black, went into </p><p>pardnership with Finch, us in’ stolen money. </p><p>That’s clear enough. But did Black ever </p><p>have a sister?” </p><p> The suffering man looked reproaclrful,</p><p>but he gave answer. </p><p> “Never had a sister or any other rela-</p><p>tives.” </p><p> “-!” said the boss ruefully. “And</p><p>I swallowed that vam! I guess I’m gittin’ </p><p>old!” </p><p>I ONE year later. Again the boss </p><p>r/S A was PrePar*n£ f°r 311 evening’s </p><p>jLjhLf\ festivity in his enlarged dance-hall. </p><p>Again a knot of men congregated about the </p><p>bar or wandered around the lighted street </p><p>amid the sounds of tinkling music. It was </p><p>the same old settlement, and yet it had </p><p>changed a bit. Freight-teams were stream- </p><p>ing in with supplies for the new dam in the </p><p>hills to the northward. Two hotels, a </p><p>barber-shop. a hardware store, a feed store </p><p>and a telephone exchange had added to </p><p>the number of buildings. The population </p><p>had grown enormously, and Government </p><p>engineers, construction laborers and rail- </p><p>road right-of-way' men were big elements </p><p>in it. </p><p>The Boss of Mirage </p><p>43 </p><p> To the north, up at Thunder Mountain,</p><p>a new town had been built overnight for </p><p>the workers. To the south, four miles from </p><p>the entrance to Lost Deer Valley—and </p><p>buying its hay—a railroad camp was estab- </p><p>lished. Along the projected railroad line </p><p>settlers were taking up land daily, in ad- </p><p>vance of the coming irrigation waters. </p><p>Dolan’s store had four clerks. Down at </p><p>the county-seat a new collection of officials </p><p>had just been elected. The power company </p><p>was planning high-tension lines from Thun- </p><p>der Mountain to the coast and had the </p><p>franchises. The county was booming. </p><p> With a check in his pocket for hay just</p><p>sold, Harry Carlton dismounted from liis </p><p>horse in front of the old dance-hall and </p><p>walked inside. A yell greeted him. Dan </p><p>Dolan, a little more gray-haired, came </p><p>from behind the bar and extended a hairy </p><p>paw. </p><p> “Congratulations!” he roared.</p><p> Then he turned to the assembled crowd</p><p>and held up his hand like a prize-fight </p><p>announcer. </p><p> “Gents, one and aJI!” he shouted.</p><p>“Shake hands with Harry Carlton, new </p><p>member of the County Board of Super- </p><p>visors from Mirage!” </p><p> They shook hands—prospectors and</p><p>miners, ranchers and grain-buvers, engi- </p><p>neers and laborers, until finally Carlton </p><p>broke away from them and dragged the </p><p>boss into the rear of his greatly enlarged </p><p>store, where there was more privacy. </p><p> “Well, she’s all over,” he said, perching</p><p>on a counter and accepting one of the </p><p>deadly cigars. “I owe it to you, Dolan, and </p><p>so does the county. I want to thank you.” </p><p>The boss waved it away. </p><p> “It wasn’t me,” he demurred. “If you</p><p>hadn’t stacked up pretty well that first </p><p>time when you went below and the boys </p><p>looked you over, you’d ’a’ been passed up. </p><p>You got what was cornin’.” </p><p> Carlton chuckled.</p><p> “Huh! With half the old gang in jail</p><p>and the rest skipped out, the election was </p><p>so one-sided there wasn’t any fun to it. </p><p>Campbell becomes superior judge by a </p><p>vote of four-thousand-and-thirty to one. </p><p>WTio wrote in that other name?” </p><p> “I guess we needn’t worry about that,”</p><p>responded the amiable boss. “How’s the </p><p>wife and kid?” </p><p> “That’s what I wanted to talk about.</p><p>I	told vou over the ’phone about the boy</p><p>coming, but I didn’t tell you the rest of it. </p><p>My wife’s mother is head of a W.

That boy’s going to be named after </p><p>the toughest old saloon-keeper in the </p><p>State!” </p><p> Dolan looked startled, and then he stared</p><p>out of the door for a long time. But, when </p><p>the leonine old face came back toward </p><p>Carlton again, it was very somber, and he </p><p>shook his head. </p><p> “Not saloon-keeper, boy; not for very</p><p>long, anyhow.

As for Lucile, </p><p>she would have told you herself that she </p><p>felt just like a bird between two snakes— </p><p>terrified and fascinated—especially by that </p><p>little man with the pale face and the light </p><p>gray eyes and the slender white hands </p><p>unstained by toil, one of which rested </p><p>lightly upon the desk and was only clenched </p><p>now and then at a word or a look from the </p><p>other man or from Lucile herself. </p><p> As for that other, he just tried to brow-</p><p>beat her. It was not difficult, for in truth </p><p>she felt frightened enough already with all </p><p>this talk of traitors and that awful threat </p><p>of the guillotine. </p><p> But Lucile Clamette would have re-</p><p>mained splendidly loyal in spite of all those </p><p>threats if it hadn’t been for the children. </p><p>She was little mother to them, for father </p><p>was a cripple with speech and mind already </p><p>impaired by creeping paralysis, and mama </p><p>had died when little Josephine was born. </p><p>And now those fiends threatened not only </p><p>her but Etienne, who was not fourteen, </p><p>and Valentine, who was not much more </p><p>than ten, with death, unless she—Luctle-7- </p><p>broke the solemn word which she had given </p><p>to M. le Marquis. At first she had tried </p><p>to deny all knowledge of M. le Marquis' </p><p>whereabouts.</p><p> “I can assure M. le Commissairc that I</p><p>do not know,” she had persisted quietly, </p><p>even though her heart was beating so rapidly </p><p>in her bosom that she felt as if she must </p><p>choke. </p><p> “Call me Citizen Commissary,” Lel&gt;el had</p><p>riposted curtly. "‘I should take it as a </p><p>proof that your aristocratic sentiments are </p><p>not so deep-rooted as they appear to be.” </p><p>“Yes, citizen!” murmured Lucile under </p><p>her breath. </p><p> Then the other one, he with the pale</p><p>eyes and# the slender white hands, leaned </p><p>fonvard over the desk, and the poor girl </p><p>felt as if a mighty and unseen force were </p><p>holding her tight, so tight that she could </p><p>neither move nor breathe nor turn her gaze </p><p>away from those pale, compelling eyes. In </p><p>the remote corner little Josephine was </p><p>whimpering, and Etienne's big, dark eyes </p><p>were fixed bravely upon his eldest sister. </p><p> “There, there, little citizeness.” the</p><p>awful man said in a voice that sounded </p><p>low and almost caressing. “There is noth- </p><p>ing to be frightened of. No one is going </p><p>to hurt you or your little family. We only </p><p>want you to be reasonable.

All that we want you to do is </p><p>to write a letter to M. le Marquis—one </p><p>that I myself will dictate to you. \ou </p><p>have written to M. le Marquis before now, </p><p>on business matters, have you not.'” </p><p> “Yes, monsieur. Yes, citizen,” stam-</p><p>mered Lucile through her tears. “Father </p><p>was bailiff to M. le Marquis until he became </p><p>a cripple, and now- I-” </p><p> “Do not write any letter, Lucile, ’</p><p>fitienne suddenly broke in with forceful </p><p>vehemence. “It is a trap set by these </p><p>miscreants to entrap M. le Marquis.” </p><p> There was a second’s silence in the room</p><p>Needs Must </p><p>45 </p><p>after this sudden outburst on the part of </p><p>the lad. Then the man with the pale face </p><p>said quietly: </p><p> “Citizen Lebel, order the removal of</p><p>that boy. Let him be kept in custody </p><p>till he has learned to hold his tongue.” </p><p> But, before Lebel could speak to the</p><p>two soldiers who were standing on guard </p><p>at the door, Lucile had uttered a loud cry </p><p>of agonized protest. </p><p> “No! No! Monsieur! That is—citizen!'7</p><p>she implored. “Do not take Etienne away.</p><p>He will be silent. I promise you that he </p><p>will be silent. Only do not take him away! </p><p>fitienne, my little one!” she added, turning </p><p>her tear-filled eyes to her brother. “I </p><p>entreat thee to hold thy tongue!” </p><p> The others, too, clung to Etienne, and</p><p>the lad, awed and subdued, relapsed into </p><p>silence. </p><p> “Now then,” resumed Lebel roughly</p><p>after a while. “Let us get on with this </p><p>business. I am sick to death of it. It has </p><p>lasted far too long already.” </p><p> He fixed his bloodshot, protruding eyes</p><p>upon Lucile and continued gruffly: </p><p> “Now listen to me, my wench, for this</p><p>is going to be my last word. Citizen </p><p>Chauvelin here has already been very </p><p>lenient with you by allowing this let Lea: </p><p>business. If i had my way, I’d make you </p><p>speak here and now. As it is, you either </p><p>sit dowTi and write the letter at Citizen </p><p>Chauvelin’s dictation at once, or I send </p><p>you with that impudent brother of yours </p><p>and your imbecile father to jail, on a charge </p><p>of treason against the state, for aiding and </p><p>abetting the enemies of the republic. And </p><p>you know what the consequences of such </p><p>a charge usually are. The other two brats </p><p>will go to a House of Correction, there to </p><p>be detained during the pleasure of the </p><p>Committee of Public Safety. That is my </p><p>last word/’ he reiterated fiercely. “Now', </p><p>which is it to be?” </p><p> He paused, and the girl's wan cheeks</p><p>turned the color of lead. She moistened her </p><p>lips once or twice with her tongue; beads </p><p>of perspiration appeared at the roots of </p><p>her hair. She gazed helplessly at her tor- </p><p>mentors, not daring to look on those three </p><p>huddled-up little figures there in the </p><p>corner. </p><p> A few seconds sped away in silence. The</p><p>man with the pale eyes rose and pushed </p><p>his chair away. He went to the window </p><p>and stood there with his back to the room, </p><p>those slender white hands of his clasped </p><p>behind him. Neither the commissary nor </p><p>the girl appeared to interest him further. </p><p>He was just gazing out of the window'. </p><p> The other was still sprawiing beside the</p><p>desk, liis large, coarse hand—how different </p><p>his hands were—w'as beating a devil’s </p><p>tatoo upon the arm of his chair. </p><p> AFTER a fewr minutes Lucile made</p><p>iinufl a Solent effort to compose herself, </p><p>wiped the moisture from her pallid </p><p>forehead and dried the tears wrhich still </p><p>hung upon her lashes. Then she rose from</p><p>her chair and walked resolutely up to the </p><p>desk. </p><p> “I will write the letter,” she said simply.</p><p> Lebel gave a snort of satisfaction, but</p><p>the other did not move from his position </p><p>near the window. The boy, Etienne, had </p><p>uttered a cry of passionate protest. </p><p> “Do not give M. le Marquis away,</p><p>Lucile!” he said hotly. “I am not afraid </p><p>to die.” </p><p> But Lucile had made up her mind. How</p><p>could she do otherwise with these awful </p><p>threats hanging over them all? She and </p><p>Etienne and poor father gone, and the two </p><p>young ones in one of those awful Houses </p><p>of Correction, wrhere children were taught </p><p>to hate the Church, to shun the Sacraments </p><p>and to blaspheme God! </p><p> “What am I to write?” she asked dully,</p><p>resoluteh" closing her ears against her </p><p>brother’s protest. </p><p> Lebel pushed pen, ink and paper toward</p><p>her, and she sat down ready to begin. </p><p> “Write!” now came in a curt command</p><p>from the man at the window. </p><p> And Lucile wrote at his dictation:</p><p>MONSEECR LE M.-VRQCIS: </p><p> We are in grave trouble. My brother fiticnne</p><p>and I have been arrested on a charge of treason. </p><p>This means the guillotine for us and for poor father, </p><p>who can no longer speak. The two little ones are </p><p>to be sent to one of those dreadful Houses of Cor- </p><p>rection, where children are taught to deny God </p><p>and to blaspheme. You alone can save us, SI lc </p><p>MarquisI I beg you on my knees to do it. The </p><p>citizen commissary here says that you have in </p><p>your possession certain papers which are of great </p><p>value to the state and that, if I can persuade you </p><p>to give these up, Etienne, father and I and 'the </p><p>little ones will be left unmolested. M. le Marquis, </p><p>you once said that you could never adequately </p><p>repay my poor father for all his devotion in your </p><p>service. You can do it now, M. lc Marquis, by </p><p>saving us all. I will be at the chateau a week from </p><p>today. I entreat you. M. Ur Marquis, to come to </p><p>me then and to bring the papers with you. Or, </p><p>46 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>if you can devise some other means of sending the </p><p>papers to me, I will obey your behests. </p><p> I am, M. U Marquis,</p><p> Your faithful and devoted servant,</p><p>Lucan ClAMETTE. </p><p> The pen dropped from the unfortunate</p><p>girl’s fingers. She buried her face in her </p><p>hands and sobbed convulsively. The chil- </p><p>dren were silent, awed and subdued—tired </p><p>out, too. Only fitienne’s dark eyes were</p><p>fixed upon liis sister with a look of mute </p><p>reproach. </p><p> Lebel had made no attempt to interrupt</p><p>the flow of liis colleagues dictation. Only </p><p>once or twice did a hastily smothered </p><p>“What die -!” of astonishment escape </p><p>his lips. Now, when the letter was finished </p><p>and duly signed, he drew it to him and </p><p>strewed the sand over it. Chauveiin, </p><p>more impassive than ever, was once more </p><p>gazing out of the window. </p><p> “How are the ci-devant aristos to get this</p><p>letter?” die commissary asked. </p><p> “It must be put in the hollow tree which</p><p>stands by the side of the stable gate at </p><p>Montorgueil,', whispered Lucile. </p><p> “And the aristos will find it there?”</p><p> “Yes. M. le Vicomte goes there once</p><p>or twice a week to see if there is anything </p><p>there from one of us.” </p><p> “They are in hiding somewhere close by,</p><p>then?” </p><p> But to this the girl gave no reply. In-</p><p>deed, she felt as if any word now might </p><p>choke her. </p><p> “Well, no matter where they are,” the</p><p>inhuman wretch resumed with brutal cyn- </p><p>icism, “we’ve got them now—both of them. </p><p>Marquis? Vicomte?" he added and spat </p><p>on the ground to express his contempt of </p><p>such tides. “Citizen Montorgueil, father </p><p>and son—that’s all they are! And as such </p><p>they’ll walk up in state to make their bow </p><p>to Mine, la Guillolinel” </p><p> “May We go now?” stammered Lucile</p><p>dirough her tears. </p><p> Lebel nodded in assent, and the girl rose</p><p>and turned to walk toward the door. She </p><p>called to the children, and the little ones </p><p>clustered round her skirts like chicks </p><p>around the mother hen. Only fitienne </p><p>remained aloof, wradiful against his sister </p><p>for what he deemed her treachery. </p><p> “Women have no sense of honor!” he</p><p>muttered to himself with all the pride of </p><p>conscious manhood. </p><p> But Lucile felt more than ever like a bird</p><p>who is vainly trying to evade the clutches </p><p>of a fowler. She gathered the two little </p><p>ones around her. Then, with a cry like </p><p>a wounded doe, she ran quickly out of the </p><p>room. </p><p>II </p><p>AS SOON as the sound of the chil- </p><p>dren’s footsteps had died away </p><p>down the corridor, Lebel turned </p><p>with a grunt to his sdll silent companion. </p><p> “And now, Citizen Chauveiin,” he said</p><p>roughly, “perhaps you will be good enough </p><p>to explain what is the meaning of all this </p><p>tomfoolery.” </p><p> ‘•Tomfoolery, citizen?” queried the other</p><p>blandly. “What tomfoolery, pray?” </p><p>“Why, about those papers!” growled </p><p>Lebel savagely. “Cui^e you for an inter- </p><p>fering busybody! It was I who got* infor- </p><p>mation diat those pestilential aristos, the </p><p>Montorgueils, far from having fled the </p><p>country, are in hiding somewhere in my </p><p>district. I could have made the girl give </p><p>up their hiding-place pretty soon without </p><p>any help from you. What right had you </p><p>to interfere, I should like to know?” </p><p> “You know quite well what right I had.</p><p>Citizen Lebel,” replied Chauveiin with </p><p>perfect composure. “The right conferred </p><p>upon me by the Committee of Public </p><p>Safety, of whom I am sdll an unworthy </p><p>member. They sent me down here to lend </p><p>you a hand in an investigarion which is of </p><p>grave importance to them.” </p><p> “I know that!” retorted Lebel sulkily.</p><p>“But why have you invented the story of </p><p>the papers?” </p><p> “It is no invention, citizen,” rejoined</p><p>Chauveiin with slow emphasis. “The </p><p>papers do exist. They are in the possession </p><p>of the ci-dcvaut Montorgueils, father and </p><p>son. To capture the two aristos would be </p><p>not only a blunder but also criminal folly, </p><p>unless we can lay hands on the papers at </p><p>the same time.” </p><p> “But what in Satan’s name are those</p><p>papers?” ejaculated Lebel with a fierce </p><p>oath. </p><p> “Think, Citizen Lebel! Think!” was</p><p>Chauvelin’s cool rejoinder. “Metliinks you </p><p>might arrive at a pretty shrewd guess.” </p><p>Then, as the other’s bluster and bounce </p><p>suddenly collapsed under his colleague's </p><p>calm, accusing gaze, the latter continued </p><p>with impressive deliberation: </p><p>“The papers which the two aristos have </p><p>Needs Must </p><p>47 </p><p>in their possession, citizen, are receipts for </p><p>money, for bribes paid to various members </p><p>of the Committee of Public Safety by royal- </p><p>ist agents for the overthrow of our glorious </p><p>republic. You know all about them, do </p><p>you not?” </p><p> While Chauvelin spoke, a look of furtive</p><p>terror had crept into Lebel’s eyes; his </p><p>checks became the color of lead. But even </p><p>so he tried to keep up an air of incredulity </p><p>and of amazement.</p><p> “I?” he exclaimed. “What do you</p><p>mean, Citizen Chauvelin? What should </p><p>I know about it?” </p><p> “Some of those receipts are signed with</p><p>your name, Citizen Lebel,” riposted Chau- </p><p>velin forcefully. “Bah!” he added, and a </p><p>tone of savage contempt crept into his even, </p><p>calm voice now. “Henriot, Foucquier, </p><p>Ducros and the whole gang of you are in </p><p>it up to the neck: trafficking with our </p><p>enemies, trading with England, taking </p><p>bribes from every quarter for working </p><p>against the safety' of the republic. Ah, </p><p>if I had my way, I would let the hatred </p><p>of those aristos take its course. I would </p><p>let the Montorgueils and the whole pack </p><p>of royalist agents publish those infamous </p><p>proofs of your treachery and of your base- </p><p>ness to the entire world, and send the whole </p><p>lot of you to the guillotine!” </p><p> He had spoken with so much concen-</p><p>trated fury and the hatred and contempt </p><p>expressed in his pale eyes were so fierce, </p><p>that an involuntary ice-cold shiver ran </p><p>down the length of Lebel’s spine. But </p><p>even so he would not give in; he tried to </p><p>sneer and to keep up something of his </p><p>former surly defiance. </p><p> “Bah!” he exclaimed, and with a lower-</p><p>ing glance he gave hatred for hatred and </p><p>contempt for contempt. “What can you </p><p>do? An I am not mistaken, there is no </p><p>more discredited man in France today </p><p>than the unsuccessful tracker of the Scarlet </p><p>Pimpernel.” </p><p> The taunt went home. It was Chauve-</p><p>lin’s turn now to lose countenance, to pale </p><p>to the lips. The glow of virtuous indig- </p><p>nation died out of his eyes; his look became </p><p>furtive and shamed. </p><p> “You are right, Citizen Lebel,” he said</p><p>calmly after a while. “Recriminations be- </p><p>tween us are out of place. I am a dis- </p><p>credited man, as you say. Perhaps it </p><p>would have been better if the Committee </p><p>had sent me long ago to expiate my failures </p><p>on the guillotine. I should at least not </p><p>have suffered, as I am suffering now, daily, </p><p>hourly, humiliation at thought of the </p><p>triumph of an enemy whom I hate with a </p><p>passion that consumes my very soul. But </p><p>do not let us speak of me,” he went on </p><p>quietly. “There are graver affairs at </p><p>stake just now than mine own.” </p><p> Lebel said nothing more for the moment.</p><p>Perhaps he was satisfied at the success of </p><p>his taunt, even though the terror within </p><p>his craven soul still caused the cold shiver</p><p>to course up and down his spine. Chauvelin </p><p>had once more turned to the window; </p><p>his gaze was fixed upon the distance far </p><p>away. </p><p> The window gave on the north. That</p><p>way, in a straight line, lay Calais, Boulogne, </p><p>England—where he had been made to </p><p>suffer such bitter humiliation at the hands </p><p>of his elusive enemy. Far out to the west </p><p>lay Nantes, the scene of his latest defeat, </p><p>and immediately before him was Paris, </p><p>where the very walls seemed to echo that </p><p>mocking laugh of the daring Englishman </p><p>which would haunt him even to his </p><p>grave. </p><p> Lebel, unnerved by his colleague’s silence,</p><p>broke in gruffly at last: </p><p> “Well then, citizen,” he said with a</p><p>feeble attempt at another sneer, “if you </p><p>are not thinking of sending us all to the </p><p>guillotine just yet, perhaps you will be </p><p>good enough to explain just how the matter </p><p>stands?” </p><p> “Fairly simply, alas!” replied Chauvelin</p><p>dryly. “The two Montorgueils, father </p><p>and son, under assumed names, were the </p><p>royalist agents who succeeded in suborning </p><p>men such as you, citizen, and the whole </p><p>gang of you. We have tracked them down </p><p>to this district, have confiscated their </p><p>lands and ransacked the old chateau for </p><p>valuables and so on. Twro days later the </p><p>first of a series of pestilential anonvmous </p><p>letters reached the Committee of Public </p><p>Safety, threatening the publication of a </p><p>whole series of compromising documents if </p><p>the Marquis and the Yicomte de Montor- </p><p>gueil were in any way molested and if all </p><p>the Montorgueil property is not immedi- </p><p>ately restored.” </p><p> “I suppose it is quite certain that those</p><p>receipts and documents do exist?” sug- </p><p>gested Lebel. </p><p> “Perfectly-certain. One of the receipts,</p><p>signed by Henriot, was sent as a specimen.” </p><p>48 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “My-!” ejaculated Lebel and wiped</p><p>the cold sweat from his brow. </p><p> “Yes, you'll all want help from some-</p><p>where,” retorted Chauvelin coolly. "From </p><p>above or from below, if the people get to </p><p>know what miscreants you are. 1 do be- </p><p>lieve,” he added with a vicious snap of his </p><p>thin lips, “that they would cheat the </p><p>guillotine of you and in the end drag you </p><p>out of the tumbrils and tear you to pieces </p><p>limb from limb!”</p><p> Once more that look of furtive terror</p><p>crept into the commissary’s bloodshot eyes. </p><p> “Thank the Lord,” he muttered, “that</p><p>we were able to get hold of the jvench </p><p>Clamette!” </p><p> “At my suggestion,” retorted Chauvelin</p><p>curtly. “I always believe in threatening </p><p>the weak if you want to coerce the strong. </p><p>The Montorgueils can not resist the wench's </p><p>appeal. Even if they do at first, we can </p><p>apply the screw by clapping one of the </p><p>young ones in jail. Within a week we shall </p><p>have those papers, Citizen Lebel. And, </p><p>if in the meanwhile no one commits a </p><p>further blunder, we can close the trap on </p><p>the Montorgueils without further trouble.” </p><p>Lebel said nothing more, and after a </p><p>while Chauvelin went back to the desk, </p><p>picked up the letter which poor Lucile had </p><p>written and watered with her tears, folded </p><p>it deliberately and slipped it into the inner </p><p>pocket of his coat. </p><p> “What are you going to do?” queried</p><p>Lebel anxiously. </p><p> “Drop this letter into the hollow tree</p><p>by the side of the stable gate at Montor- </p><p>gueil,” replied Chauvelin simply. </p><p> “What?” exclaimed the other. "Your-</p><p>self?” </p><p> “Why, of course! Think you I would</p><p>entrust such an errand to another living </p><p>soul?” </p><p>Ill </p><p>(ryp SEVERAL hours later, when the </p><p>two children had had their dinner </p><p>and had settled down to play in </p><p>the garden and father had been cozily tucked </p><p>up for his afternoon sleep, Lucile called </p><p>her brother Etienne to her. The boy had </p><p>not spoken to her since that terrible time </p><p>spent in the presence of those two awful </p><p>men. He had eaten no dinner, only sat </p><p>glowering, staring straight out before him', </p><p>from time to time throwing a look of burn- </p><p>ing reproach upon his sister. Now, when </p><p>she called to him, he tried to run away </p><p>and was half-way up the stairs before she </p><p>could seize hold of him. </p><p> "Etienne, nwn petit/” she implored as</p><p>her arms closed around his shrinking figure. </p><p> "Let me go, Lucile!” the boy pleaded</p><p>obstinately. </p><p> "Mon petit, listen to me!” she pleaded.</p><p>‘‘All is not lost, if you will stand by me.” </p><p> "All is lost, Lucile!” Etienne cried,</p><p>striving t^&gt; keep back a flood of passionate </p><p>tears. “Honor is lost. Your treachery </p><p>lias disgraced us all. If M. k Marquis and</p><p>M. le Viconik are brought to the guillotine, </p><p>their blood will be upon our heads.” </p><p> “Upon mine alone, my little Etienne,”</p><p>she said sadly. “But God alone can judge </p><p>me. It was a terrible alternative: M. le </p><p>Marquis—or you and Valentine and little </p><p>Josephine and poor father, who is so help- </p><p>less! But don’t let us talk of it all. All </p><p>is not lost, I am sure. The last time that </p><p>I spoke with M. k Marquis—it was in </p><p>February* do you remember?—he was full </p><p>of hope and, oh, so kind! Well, he told </p><p>me then that, if ever I or any of us here </p><p>were in such grave trouble that we did not </p><p>know where to turn, one of us was to put </p><p>on our very oldest clothes, look as like a </p><p>barefooted beggar as we could and then go </p><p>to Paris to a place called the Cabaret de la </p><p>Liberte, in the Rue Christine. There we </p><p>are to ask for the Citizen Rateau. and we </p><p>are to tell him all our troubles, whatever </p><p>they are. Well, we are in such trouble </p><p>now, tnon petit, that we don’t know where </p><p>to turn. Put on the very oldest clothes, </p><p>little one, and run barefooted into Paris, </p><p>find the Citizen Rateau and tell him just </p><p>what has happened: the letter which </p><p>they have forced me to write, the threats </p><p>which they held over me if I did not write </p><p>it—everything. Dost hear?” </p><p> Already the boy’s eyes were glowing.</p><p>The thought that he individually could do </p><p>something to retrieve the awful shame of </p><p>his sister's treachery spurred him to ac- </p><p>tivity. It needed no persuasion on Lucile’s </p><p>part to induce him to go. She made him </p><p>put on some old clothes and stuffed a piece </p><p>of bread and cheese into his breeches </p><p>pocket. </p><p> It was close upon eight kilometers to</p><p>Paris, but that run was one of the happiest </p><p>which Etienne had ever made. And he </p><p>did it barefooted, too, feeling neither fatigue </p><p>nor soreness, despite the hardness of the </p><p>Needs Must </p><p>49 </p><p>road after a three weeks’ drought which </p><p>had turned mud into hard cakes and ruts </p><p>into fissures which tore the lad’s feet till </p><p>they bled. </p><p> He did not reach the Cabaret de la</p><p>Liberte till nightfall, and, when he got </p><p>there, he hardly dared to enter. The filth, </p><p>the squalor, the hoarse voices which rose </p><p>from that cellar-like place below the level </p><p>of the street repelled the country-bred lad. </p><p>Were it not for the desperate urgency of his </p><p>errand, he never would have dared to enter.</p><p>As it was, the fumes of alcohol and steam- </p><p>ing, dirty clothes nearly choked him. and </p><p>he could scarcely stammer the name of </p><p>Citizen Rateau when a gruff voice present- </p><p>ly demanded his purpose. </p><p> He realized now how tired he was and</p><p>how hungry. He had not thought to pause </p><p>in order to consume the small provision of </p><p>bread and cheese with which thoughtful </p><p>Lucile had provided him. Now he was </p><p>ready to faint when a loud guffaw, which </p><p>echoed from one end of the horrible place </p><p>to the other, greeted his timid request. </p><p> “Citizen Rateau!” the same gruff voice</p><p>called out hilariously. “Why, there he is! </p><p>Here, citizen! There’s a blooming aristo </p><p>to see you.” </p><p> Etienne turned his weary eyes to the</p><p>corner which was being indicated to him. </p><p>There he saw a huge creature sprawling </p><p>across a bench, his long, powerful limbs </p><p>stretched out before him. Citizen Rateau </p><p>was clothed rather than dressed in a soiled </p><p>shirt, ragged breeches and tattered stock- </p><p>ings, with shoes down at heel and a faded </p><p>crimson cap. His face looked congested </p><p>and sunken about the eyes; he appeared </p><p>to be asleep, for stertorous breathing came </p><p>at intervals from between his parted lips. </p><p>Every now and then a racking cough </p><p>seemed to tear at his broad chest. </p><p> Etienne gave him one look, shuddering</p><p>with horror despite himself at the aspect </p><p>of this bloated wretch from whom salvation </p><p>was to come. The whole place seemed to </p><p>him hideous' and loathsome in the extreme. </p><p>What it all meant he could not understand. </p><p>All that he knew was that this seemed </p><p>like another hideous trap into which he </p><p>and Lucile had fallen and that he must </p><p>fly from it—fly at all costs, before he be- </p><p>trayed M. le Marquis still further to these </p><p>drink-sodden brutes. Another moment </p><p>and he feared that he might faint. The </p><p>din of a bibulous song rang in his ears; the </p><p>reek of alcohol turned him giddy and sick. </p><p>He had only just enough strength to turn </p><p>and totter back into the open. There his </p><p>senses reeled; the lights in the houses oppo- </p><p>site began to dance wildly before his eyes— </p><p>and he remembered nothing more. </p><p> IV</p><p>THERE is nothing now in the whole </p><p>countryside quite so desolate and </p><p>forlorn as the chateau of Montor- </p><p>gueil, with its once magnificent park, now </p><p>overgrown with weeds, its encircling walls </p><p>broken dow-n, its terraces devastated and</p><p>its stately gates rusty and tom. </p><p> Just by the side of what was known in</p><p>happier times as the stable gate there stands </p><p>a hollow tree. It is not inside the park but </p><p>just outside, and it shelters the narrow </p><p>lane which skirts the park walls against the </p><p>blaze of the afternoon sun. </p><p> Its beneficent • shade is a favorite spot</p><p>for an afternoon siesta, for there is a bit of </p><p>green sward under the tree and all along </p><p>the side of the road. But, as the shades </p><p>of evening gather in, the lane is usually </p><p>deserted, shunned by the neighboring </p><p>peasantry on account of its eery loneliness, </p><p>so different from the former bustle which </p><p>used to reign around the park gates when </p><p>M. le Marquis and his family were still in </p><p>residence. Nor does the lane lead any- </p><p>where, for it is a mere loop which gives </p><p>on the main road at either end. </p><p> Henri de Montorgueil chose a peculiarly</p><p>dark night early in September for one of his </p><p>periodical visits to the hollow tree. It was </p><p>close on nine o’clock when he passed </p><p>stealthily down the feme, keeping close </p><p>to the park wall. A soft rain was falling, </p><p>the first since the prolonged drought, and, </p><p>though it made the road heavy and slippery </p><p>in places, it helped to deaden the sound </p><p>of the young man’s furtive footsteps. </p><p> The air, except for the patter of the rain,</p><p>was absolutely still. Henri de Montor- </p><p>gueil paused from time to time with neck </p><p>craned forward, even’ sense on the alert, </p><p>listening like any poor, hunted beast for </p><p>the slightest sound which might betray </p><p>the approach of danger. </p><p> As many a time before he reached the</p><p>hollow tree in safety, felt for and found </p><p>in the usual place the letter which the </p><p>unfortunate girl, Lucile, had written to him. </p><p>Then with it in his hand he turned to the </p><p>50 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>stable gate. It had long since ceased to </p><p>be kept locked and bared. Pillaged and </p><p>ransacked by order of the Committee of </p><p>Public Safety, there was nothing left inside </p><p>the park walls worth keeping under lock </p><p>and key. </p><p> Henri slipped stealthily through the</p><p>gates and made his way along the drive. </p><p>Every stone, every nook and cranny of </p><p>his former home was familiar to him, and </p><p>he turned into a shed where in former times </p><p>wheelbarrows and garden tools were wont </p><p>to be kept. Now it was full of debris, </p><p>lumber of every sort. A more safe or</p><p>secluded spot could not be imagined. </p><p>Henri crouched in the farthermost corner </p><p>of the shed. Then from his belt he de- </p><p>tached a small dark lantern, opened its </p><p>shutter and with the aid of the tiny, dim </p><p>light read the contents of the letter. </p><p> For a long while after that he remained</p><p>quite still—as still as a man who has </p><p>received a stunning blow-on the head and </p><p>has partis lost consciousness. The blow </p><p>was indeed a staggering one. Lucile Cla- </p><p>met te, with the invincible power of her own </p><p>helplessness, was demanding the surrender </p><p>of a weapon which had been a safeguard </p><p>for the Montorgueils all this while. The </p><p>papers which compromised a number of </p><p>influential members of the Committee of </p><p>Public Safety had been the most perfect </p><p>arms of defense against persecution and </p><p>spoliation. </p><p> And now these were to be given up. Oh,</p><p>there could be no question of that! Even </p><p>before consulting with his father, Henri </p><p>knew that the papers would have to be </p><p>given up. They were clever, those revo- </p><p>lutionaries. The thought of holding inno- </p><p>cent children as hostages could only have </p><p>originated in minds attuned to the villainies </p><p>of devils. But it was unthinkable that the </p><p>children should suffer. </p><p> After a while the young man roused</p><p>himself from the torpor into which the </p><p>suddenness of this awful blow had plunged </p><p>him. By the light of the lantern he </p><p>scribbled a few words on a scrap of paper </p><p>tom from his pocketbook. </p><p>My rear Loctle: </p><p> As you say, our debt to your father and to you all</p><p>never could he adequately repaid. You and the </p><p>children shall never suffer whilst we have the </p><p>power to save*you. You will find the papers in </p><p>the receptacle you know of inside the chimney </p><p>of what used to by my mother's boudoir. You </p><p>will find the receptacle unlocked. One day before </p><p>the term you name I myself will place the papers </p><p>there for you. With them my father and I do give </p><p>up our lives to save you and the little ones from </p><p>the persecution of those fiends. May the good </p><p>God guard you all. </p><p> He signed the letter with his initials,</p><p>H. de M. Then he crept back to the gate </p><p>and dropped the message into the hollow </p><p>of the tree. </p><p> A quarter of an hour later Henri de</p><p>Montorgueil was wending his way back </p><p>to the hiding-place which had sheltered </p><p>him and his father for so long. Silence </p><p>and darkness soon held undisputed sway</p><p>once more around the hollow tree. Even </p><p>the rain had ceased its gentle pattering. </p><p>From far away came the sound of a church </p><p>bell striking the hour of ten. Then nothing </p><p>more. </p><p> A few more minutes of absolute silence;</p><p>then something dark and furtive began </p><p>to move out of the long grass which bor- </p><p>dered the roadside—something that in </p><p>movement was almost like a snake. It </p><p>dragged itself along close to the ground, </p><p>making no sound as it moved. Soon it </p><p>reached the hollow tree, rose to the height </p><p>of a man and flattened itself against the </p><p>tree trunk. Then it put out a hand, felt </p><p>for the hollow receptacle and groped for </p><p>the missive which Henri de Montorgueil </p><p>had dropped in there a while ago. </p><p> The next moment a tiny ray of light</p><p>gleamed through the darkness like a star. </p><p>A small, almost fragile figure of a man, </p><p>dressed in the mud-stained clothes of a </p><p>country yokel, had turned up the shutter </p><p>of a small lantern. Bv its flickering light </p><p>he deciphered the letter which Henri de </p><p>Montorgueil had written to Lucile Clamette. </p><p>“One day before the term you name </p><p>I myself will place the papers there for you.” </p><p> A sigh of satisfaction, quickly suppressed,</p><p>came through his thin, colorless lips, and </p><p>the light of the lantern caught the flash </p><p>of triumph in his pale, inscrutable eyes. </p><p> Then the light was extinguished. Im-</p><p>penetrable darkness swallowed up that </p><p>slender, mysterious figure again. </p><p>V </p><p>SIX days had gone by since Chauveiin </p><p>had delivered his cruel “either—or” </p><p>to poor little Lucile Clamette; three </p><p>since he had found Henri de Montorgueils </p><p>reply to the girl’s appeal in the hollow of </p><p>Needs Must </p><p>5i </p><p>the tree. Since then he had made a careful </p><p>investigation of the chateau, and soon he </p><p>was able to settle it in his own mind as to </p><p>which room had been the boudoir of </p><p>Madame la Marquise in the past. It was </p><p>a small apartment, having direct access </p><p>to the first landing of the staircase, and the </p><p>one window gave on the rose garden at </p><p>the back of the house. Inside the monu- </p><p>mental hearth, at an arm's length up the </p><p>wide chimney, a receptacle had been con- </p><p>trived in the brickwork, with a small iron </p><p>door which opened and closed with a secret </p><p>spring. Chauvelin, whose nefarious calling </p><p>had rendered him proficient in such mat-</p><p>ters, had soon mastered the workings of </p><p>that spring. He could now open and close </p><p>the iron door at will. </p><p> Up to a late hour on the sixth night of</p><p>this weary waiting the receptacle inside </p><p>the chimney was still empty. That night </p><p>Chauvelin had determined to spend at the </p><p>chateau. He could not have rested else- </p><p>where. </p><p> Even his colleague, Lebel, could not know</p><p>what the possession of those papers would </p><p>mean to the discredited agent of the Com- </p><p>mittee of Public Safety. With them in his </p><p>hands, he could demand rehabilitation; </p><p>he could purchase immunity from those </p><p>sneers which had been so galling to his </p><p>arrogant soul—sneers which had become </p><p>more and more marked, more and more </p><p>unendurable, above all, more and more </p><p>menacing as he piled up failure on failure </p><p>with every encounter with the Scarlet </p><p>Pimpernel. </p><p> Immunity and rehabilitation! This #ould</p><p>mean that he could once more measure </p><p>his wits and his power with that audacious </p><p>enemy who had brought about his downfall. </p><p> “In Lhe name of Satan, bring us those</p><p>papers!” Robespierre himself had cried </p><p>vyith unwonted passion ere he sent him out </p><p>on this important mission. “None of us </p><p>could stand the scandal of such disclosures. </p><p>It would mean absolute ruin for us all.” </p><p> And Chauvelin that night, as soon as</p><p>the shades of evening had drawn in, took </p><p>up his stand in the chateau in the small </p><p>inner room which was contiguous to the </p><p>boudoir. </p><p> Here he sat beside the open wondow for</p><p>hour upon hour, his every sense on the </p><p>alert, listening for the first footfall upon </p><p>the gravel path below. Though the hours </p><p>went by leaden-footed, he was neither </p><p>excited nor anxious. The Clamette family </p><p>was such a precious hostage that the </p><p>Montorgueils were bound to comply with </p><p>Lucile’s demand for the papers by every </p><p>dictate of honor and of humanity. </p><p> “While we have those people in our</p><p>power,” Chauvelin had reiterated to him- </p><p>self more than once during the course of </p><p>his long vigil, “even that meddlesome </p><p>Scarlet Pimpernel can do nothing to save </p><p>those cursed Montorgueils.” </p><p> The night was dark and still. Not a</p><p>breath of air stirred the branches of the </p><p>trees or the shrubberies in the park; any </p><p>footsteps, however wary, must echo through </p><p>that perfect and absolute silence. Chauve-</p><p>lin’s keen, pale eyes tried to pierce the </p><p>gloom in the direction whence in all proba- </p><p>bility the aristo would come. Vaguely he </p><p>wondered if it would be Henri de Montor- </p><p>gueil or the old marquis himself who would </p><p>bring the papers. </p><p> “Bah! Whichever one it is,” he mut-</p><p>tered, “we can easily get the other, once </p><p>those abominable papers are in our hands. </p><p>And, even if both Lhe aristos escape,” he </p><p>added menially, “ ’Lis no matter, once we </p><p>have the papers.” </p><p> Far away a distant church bell struck</p><p>the midnight hour. The stillness of the </p><p>air had become oppressive. A kind of </p><p>torpor bom of intense fatigue lulled the </p><p>Terrorist’s senses to somnolence. His head </p><p>fell forward on his breast. </p><p>VI </p><p>SUDDENLY a shiver of excite- </p><p>ment went right through him. He </p><p>was fully awake now, with glowing </p><p>eyes wide open and the icy calm of perfect </p><p>confidence ruling every nerve. The sound </p><p>of stealthy footsleps had reached his ear. </p><p> He could see nothing, either outside or</p><p>in, but his fingers felt for the pistol wrhich </p><p>he carried in his belt. The aristo was evi- </p><p>dently alone; only one solitary footstep </p><p>was approaching the chateau. </p><p> Chauvelin had left ajar the door which</p><p>gave on the boudoir. The staircase was </p><p>on the other side of that fateful room, and </p><p>the door leading to that was closed. A </p><p>few minutes of tense expectancy went by. </p><p>Then through the silence there came the </p><p>sound of furtive footsteps on the stairs, </p><p>the creaking of a loose board and finally </p><p>the stealthy opening of the door. </p><p>52 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> In all liis adventurous carcer Chauvelin</p><p>had never fell so calm. His heart beat </p><p>quite evenly, and his senses were undis- </p><p>turbed by the slightest tingling of his </p><p>nerves. The stealthy sounds in the next </p><p>room brought the movements of the aristo </p><p>perfectly clearly before his menial vision. </p><p>The latter was earning a small dark lantern. </p><p>As soon as he entered, he flashed its light </p><p>about the room. Then he deposited the </p><p>lantern on the floor, close beside the hearth, </p><p>and started to feel up die chimney for the </p><p>hidden receptacle. </p><p> Chauvelin watched him now as a cat</p><p>watches a mouse, savoring these few mo- </p><p>ments of anticipated triumph. Noiselessly </p><p>he pushed open the door which gave on the</p><p>boudoir. By the feeble light of the lantern </p><p>on the ground he could only see the vague </p><p>outline of the aristo’s back, bending for- </p><p>ward to his task, but a thrill went through </p><p>him as he saw a bundle of papers lying on </p><p>tiie ground close by. </p><p> Everything was ready; the trap was set.</p><p>Here was a complete victor)' at last. It was </p><p>obviously the young Vicomte de Mont- </p><p>orgueil who had come to do the deed. His </p><p>head was up the chimney even now. The </p><p>old marquis’s back would have looked nar- </p><p>rower and more fragile. Chauvelin held his </p><p>breath; then he gave a sharp little cough </p><p>and took the pistol from his belt. </p><p> The sound caused the aristo to turn.</p><p>The next moment a loud and merry laugh </p><p>roused the dormant echoes of the old cha- </p><p>teau, and a pleasant drawling voice said in </p><p>English: </p><p> “I am demmed if this is not my dear old</p><p>friend M. Chambertin! Zounds, sir! Who’d </p><p>have thought of meeting you here!” </p><p> Had a cannon suddenly exploded at</p><p>Chauvelin’s feet, he would have felt less </p><p>unnerved. For the space of two heart- </p><p>beats he stood there, his eyes glued on </p><p>his arch-enemy, that execrated Scarlet </p><p>Pimpernel, whose mocking glance, even </p><p>through the intervening gloom, seemed to </p><p>have deprived him of consciousness. But </p><p>that phase of helplessness only lasted for a </p><p>moment; the next, all the marvelous possi- </p><p>bilities of this encounter flashed through the </p><p>Terrorist's keen mind. </p><p> Everything was ready. The trap was</p><p>set. The unfortunate Clamettes were still </p><p>the bait which now would bring a far more </p><p>noble quarry into the mesh than ever he— </p><p>Chauvelin—had dared to hope. </p><p> He raised his pistol, ready to fire. But</p><p> already Sir Percy Blakeney was on him,</p><p> and, with a swift movement which the other</p><p> was too weak to resist, he wrenched the</p><p> weapon from his enemy's grasp.</p><p> “Why, how hasty you are, my dear M.</p><p> Chambertin," he said lightly. “Surely you</p><p> are not in such a hurry to put a bullet into</p><p> me!”</p><p> The position now was one which would</p><p> liave made even a braver man than Chau-</p><p> velin quake. He stood alone and unarmed</p><p> in face of an enemy from whom he could</p><p> expect no mercy. But, even so, his first</p><p> thought was not of escape. He had not</p><p> only appraised his own danger but also the</p><p> immense power which he held while the</p><p> Clamettes remained as hostages in the</p><p> hands of his colleague, Lebel.</p><p> “You have me at a disadvantage, Sir</p><p> Percy,” he said, speaking every whit as</p><p> coolly as his foe. “ But only momentarily.</p><p> You can kill me, of course, but. if 1 do not</p><p> return from this expedition, not only safe</p><p> and sound but with a certain packet of</p><p> papers in my hands, my colleague, Lebel,</p><p> has instructions to proceed at once against</p><p> the girl, Clamette, and the whole family.'*</p><p> “I know that well enough.” rejoined Sir</p><p> Percy with a quaint laugh. “I know what</p><p> * venemous reptiles you and those of your</p><p> kidney are. You certainly do owe your life</p><p> at the present moment to the unfortunate</p><p> girl whom you are persecuting with such in-</p><p> famous callousness.”</p><p> Chauvelin drew a sigh of relief. The</p><p> situation was shaping itself more to his sat-</p><p> isfaction already. Through the gloom he</p><p> could vaguely discern the Englishman’s</p><p> massive form standing a few paces away,</p><p> one hand buried in his breeches pocket, the</p><p> other still holding t he pistol. On the ground</p><p> close by the hearth was the small lantern,</p><p> and in its dim light the packet of papers</p><p> gleamed white and tempting in the dark-</p><p> ness. Chauvelin’s keen eyes had fastened</p><p> on it and saw the form of receipt for money</p><p> with Henriot’s signature, which he recog-</p><p> nized. on the top.</p><p> He himself had never felt so calm. The</p><p> only thing he could regret was that he was</p><p> alone. Half a dozen men now, and this</p><p> impudent foe could indeed be brought to his</p><p> knees. And this time there would be no</p><p> risks taken, no chances for escape. Some-</p><p> how it seemed to Chauvelin as if something</p><p> of the Scarlet Pimpernel’s audacity and</p><p>Needs Must </p><p>53 </p><p>foresight had gone from him. As he stood </p><p>there, looking broad and physically power- </p><p>ful, there was something wavering and unde- </p><p>cided in his attitude, as if the edge had been </p><p>taken off his former recklessness and en- </p><p>thusiasm. He had brought the compromis- </p><p>ing papers here and had no doubt helped the </p><p>Montorgueils to escape. But, while Lucile </p><p>Clamette and her family were under the eye </p><p>of Lebel, no amount of impudence could </p><p>force a successful bargaining. </p><p>IT WAS Chauveiin now w'ho ap- </p><p>peared the more keen and the more </p><p>alert. The Englishman seemed un- </p><p>decided what to do next and remained </p><p>silent, toying with the pistol. He even </p><p>smothered a yawn. Chauveiin saw his op-</p><p>portunity. With the quick movement of a </p><p>cat pouncing upon a mouse, he stooped and </p><p>seized that packet of papers and would then </p><p>and there have made a dash for the door </p><p>with them; only that, as he seized the </p><p>packet, the string which held it together </p><p>gave way, and the papers were scattered all </p><p>over the floor. </p><p> Receipts for money? Compromising let-</p><p>ters? No! Blank sheets of paper, all of </p><p>them—all except the one which had lain </p><p>tantalizingly on the top—the one receipt </p><p>signed by Citizen Henriot. Sir Percy </p><p>laughed lightly. </p><p> “Did you really think, my good friend,”</p><p>he said, “that I would be such a demmed </p><p>fool as to place my best wreapon so readily </p><p>to your hand?” </p><p> “Your best weapon, Sir Percy?” retorted</p><p>Chauveiin with a sneer. “What use is it to </p><p>you while we hold Lucile Clamette?” </p><p> “While I hold Lucile Clamette, you</p><p>mean, my dear M. Chambertin,” riposted </p><p>Blakeney with elaborate blandness. </p><p> “You hold Lucile Clamette? Bah! I</p><p>defy you to drag a whole family like that </p><p>out of our clutches. The man a cripple, the </p><p>children helpless! And you think they can </p><p>escape our vigilance when all our men are </p><p>warned! How do you think they are going </p><p>to get across the river, Sir Percy, when every </p><p>bridge is closely watched? How will they </p><p>get across Paris when at every gate our men </p><p>are on the lookout for them?” </p><p> “They can’t do it, my dear M. Cham-</p><p>bertin,” rejoined Sir Percy blandly, “else </p><p>I were not here.” </p><p> Then, as Chauveiin—fuming, irritated</p><p>despite himself as he always was when he </p><p>encountered that impudent Englishman— </p><p>shrugged his shoulders in token of contempt, </p><p>Blakeney’s powerful grasp suddenly clutched </p><p>his arm. </p><p> “Let us understand one another, my</p><p>good M. Chambertin,” he said coolly. </p><p>“Those unfortunate Clamettes, as you say, </p><p>are too helpless and too numerous to </p><p>smuggle across Paris with any chance of </p><p>success. Therefore I look to you to take </p><p>them under your protection. They are all </p><p>stowed away comfortably at this moment </p><p>in a conveyance wiiich I have provided for </p><p>them. That conveyance is waiting at the </p><p>bridge-head now. We could not cross with- </p><p>out your help; we could not get across Paris </p><p>without your august presence and your tri- </p><p>color scarf of office. So you are coming </p><p>with us, my dear M. Chambertin,” he con-</p><p>tinued, and, with force which was quite ir- </p><p>resistible, he began to drag his enemy after </p><p>him toward the door. “You are going to </p><p>sit in that conveyance with the Clamettes, </p><p>and I myself will have the honor to drive </p><p>you. And at every bridge-head you will </p><p>show your pleasing countenance and your </p><p>scarf of office to the guard and demand free </p><p>passage for yourself and your family, as a </p><p>representative member of the Committee of </p><p>Public Safety. </p><p> “And then we’ll enter Paris by the Porte</p><p>d’lvry and leave it by the Balignolles, and </p><p>everywhere your charming presence will lull </p><p>the guards’ suspicions to rest. I pray you, </p><p>come! There is no time to consider! At </p><p>noon tomorrow, without a moment’s grace, </p><p>my friend, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, wrho has the </p><p>papers in his possession, will dispose of them </p><p>as he thinks best unless I myself claim </p><p>them from him.” </p><p> While he spoke, he continued to drag his</p><p>enemy along with him with an assurance </p><p>and an impudence which was past belief. </p><p>Chauveiin wras trying to collect his thoughts, </p><p>a whirl of conflicting plans wrere running </p><p>riot in his mind. The Scarlet Pimpernel in </p><p>his power! At any point on the road he </p><p>could deliver him up to the nearest guard </p><p>and then still hold the Clamettes and de- </p><p>mand the papers . . . </p><p> “Too late, my dear M. Chambertin!”</p><p>Sir Percy’s mocking voice broke in as </p><p>if divining his thoughts. “You do not </p><p>know where to find my friend, Ffoulkes, </p><p>and at noon tomorrow, if I do not arrive to </p><p>claim those papers, there will not be a single </p><p>ragamuffin in Paris who will not be crying </p><p>54 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>your shame and that of your precious col- </p><p>leagues upon the housetops.’7 </p><p> Chauvelin’s whole nervous system was</p><p>writhing with the feeling of impotence. </p><p>Mechanically, unresisting now, he followed </p><p>his enemy down the main staircase of the </p><p>chateau and out through the wide open </p><p>gates. He could not bring himself to be- </p><p>lieve that he had been so completely foiled— </p><p>that this impudent adventurer had him </p><p>once more in the hollow of liis hand. </p><p> “In the name of Satan, bring us back</p><p>those papers!” Robespierre had com- </p><p>manded, and now he—Chauvelin—was left </p><p>in a maze of doubt, and the vita! alterna- </p><p>tive was hammering in his brain, '‘The Scar- </p><p>let Pimpernel—or those papers.” Which, </p><p>in Satan's name, was the more important?</p><p>Passion whispered, “The Scarlet Pimper- </p><p>nel!” But common sense and the fuLure of </p><p>his party, the whole future of the Revolu- </p><p>tion mayhap, demanded those compro- </p><p>mising papers. And all the while he fol- </p><p>lowed that relentless enemy through the </p><p>avenues of the park and down the lonely </p><p>lane. Overhead the trees of the forest of </p><p>Sucy, nodding in a gentle breeze, seemed to </p><p>mock his perplexity. </p><p> He had not arrived at a definite decision</p><p>wrhen the river came in sight and a carriage- </p><p>lantem threw a shaft of dim light through </p><p>the mist-laden air. Now* he felt as if he </p><p>were in a dream. He was thrust unresist- </p><p>ing into a closed chaise, wherein he felt the </p><p>presence of several other people—children </p><p>and an old man wrho was muttering cease- </p><p>lessly. As in a dream he answered ques- </p><p>tions at the bridge to a guard wrhom he </p><p>knew well. </p><p> “You know me: Armand Chauvelin, of</p><p>the Committee of Public Safety!” </p><p> As in a dream he heard the curt w'ords of</p><p>command— </p><p> “Pass on, in the name of the republic!”</p><p>And all the while the thought hammered </p><p>in his brain: </p><p> “Something must be done! This is im-</p><p>possible! This can not be! It is not I— </p><p>Chauvelin—who am sitting here, helpless, </p><p>unresisting. It is not that impudent Scarlet </p><p>Pimpernel who is sit ting there before me on </p><p>the box, driving me to utter humilia- </p><p>tion!’’ </p><p> And yet it was all true. All real. The</p><p>Clamette children w'ere sitting in front of </p><p>him, clinging to Lucile, terrified of him even </p><p>now. The old man was beside him—im- </p><p>becile and ununderstanding. The boy, Et- </p><p>iennc, was up on the box next to that auda- </p><p>cious adventurer, whose broad back ap- </p><p>peared to Chauvelin like a rock on which all </p><p>his hopes and dreams must forever be </p><p>shattered. </p><p> The chaise rattled triumphantly through</p><p>the Batignolles. It was then broad day- </p><p>light. A brilliant early Autumn day after </p><p>the rains. The sun, the keen air, all </p><p>mocked Chauvclin's helplessness, his hu- </p><p>miliation. Long before noon they passed </p><p>St. Denis. Here the chaise turned ofF </p><p>the main road, halted at a small wayside </p><p>house—nothing more than a cottage. After </p><p>which everything seemed more dreamlike </p><p>than ever. All that Chauvelin remem- </p><p>bered of it afterward was that he was once </p><p>more alone m a room with his enemy, who</p><p>had demanded his signature to a number of </p><p>safe-conducts ere he finally handed over the </p><p>packet of papers to him. </p><p> “How do I know' that they are all here?"</p><p>he heard himself vaguely muttering while </p><p>his trembling fingers handled that precious </p><p>packet. </p><p> "That's just it!” his tormentor retorted</p><p>airily. “You don't know. I don’t know </p><p>myself,” he added with a light laugh. </p><p>“And personally I don't see how' either of us </p><p>can possibly ascertain. In the meanwhile </p><p>I must bid you an revoir, my dear M. </p><p>Chambertin. I am sorry that I can not </p><p>provide you with a conveyance, and you </p><p>will have to walk several kilometers ere you </p><p>meet one. I fear me. We, in the mean- </p><p>while, will be well on our way to Dieppe, </p><p>where my yacht, the Day-Dream, lies at </p><p>anchor, and I do not think that it will be </p><p>worth your while to try to overtake us. I </p><p>thank you for the sal'e-conducts. They </p><p>will make our journey exceedingly pleasant. </p><p>Shall I give your regards to M. le Marquis </p><p>de Montorgueilor to M. le Vicomtc? They </p><p>are on board the Day-Dream, you know. </p><p>Oh! I was forgetting! Lady Blakeney de- </p><p>sired to be remembered to you.” </p><p> The next moment he was gone. Chau-</p><p>velin, standing at the window of the way- </p><p>side house, saw- Sir Percy Blakeney once </p><p>more mount the box of the chaise. This </p><p>time he ,had Sir Andrew Ffoulkes beside </p><p>him. The Clamette family were huddled </p><p>together—happy and free—inside the ve- </p><p>hicle. After which there was the usual </p><p>clatter of horses’ hoofs, the creaking of </p><p>wheels, the rattle of chains. Chauvelin </p><p>West Africa and Funkitis </p><p>55 </p><p>saw and heard nothing of that. All that </p><p>he saw at the last was Sir Percy's slender </p><p>hail’d waving him a last adieu. </p><p> After which he was left alone with</p><p>his thoughts. The packet of papers was </p><p>in his hand. He fingered it, felt its crisp- </p><p>ness, clutched it with a fierce gesture, which </p><p>was followed by a long-drawn-out sigh of in- </p><p>tense bitterness. </p><p> No one would ever know what it had cost</p><p>him to obtain these papers. No one would </p><p>ever know how much he had sacrificed of </p><p>pride, revenge and hate in order to save a </p><p>few shreds of his own party’s honor. </p><p>WEST AFRICA AND “FUNKITIS” </p><p> by THOMAS S. MILLER</p><p>TIEY call it the White Alan's Grave, </p><p>that western bulge in the pear-shape of</p><p>Africa,that comprises the Gold Coast, </p><p>Ivory Coast and, ominous term, the </p><p>Fever Coast. Fever Coast! And, as if </p><p>that name were not sufficiently frightening, the </p><p>young official or the young man going to a trading- </p><p>station on the Niger has to run the gantlet of </p><p>horrible tales of native deviltry and the insidious </p><p>ways of fever. It is a popular “sport” on the </p><p>out voyage for the ship’s officers and “old coasters” </p><p>to pump these tales into the newcomer, and by </p><p>dint of insistence and gravity of expression to </p><p>break through his morale, so that by the time </p><p>the ship noses into the exotic, fetid Niger delta </p><p>and dumps him into the silent, brooding, reeking, </p><p>stagnant mangrove swamps, his nerves are tensioned </p><p>to the worst. </p><p> Perhaps his first sight is an emaciated white</p><p>being carried aboard ship, to die at sea and spare </p><p>the colony’s mortality statistics. Then there is </p><p>bound to be an idle white around to show him the </p><p>sights. He will be taken to a large shed where kit- </p><p>bags and steamer-trunks are piled high and bear </p><p>the appalling epitaph, “Effects of J—, and R— and </p><p>M—, deceased.” He may be a bidder at one of </p><p>the pathetic little auctions of these effects and do </p><p>his share in boosting the prices, for the benefit </p><p>of a mother or widow and orphans over the sea. </p><p> He lies around that reeking swamp waiting</p><p>orders, nervously expectant of liis “first dose,” </p><p>his baptismal fever which the few whites in envy </p><p>of his beefy cheeks and obtrusive health take an </p><p>unholy delight in predicting. If he manages to </p><p>escape for a couple of weeks he becomes the target </p><p>of serious mock-sympathy and doleful prophecy. </p><p> “If you’re not inoculated before the heat and</p><p>canned chop and the mosquitoes have enervated </p><p>you it’s a ten-to-one shot you croak. That’s the </p><p>way it was with S—. He-” </p><p> Here follows a distressing tale. He will take to</p><p>surreptitiously popping a clinical thermometer </p><p>in his mouth. </p><p> “Man,” he is told, “you’ve got fever, only you</p><p>don’t know it.” </p><p> His life seems to hang on the verdict of the</p><p>mercury. He is victimized by a popular “joke”; </p><p>he is given an unreliable thermometer that adds </p><p>a few degrees to the actual condition, or the mercury </p><p>has been surreptitiously boosted. Come orders for </p><p>him to proceed to a certain station. Instantly he </p><p>is the focus of long, commiserating faces and cruel </p><p>sympathy. </p><p> “That's the rottenest hole in Nigeria. J— died</p><p>up there, and when R— went up to relieve B— </p><p>all he found of B— was a mound in the swamp. </p><p>The niggers said he died of fever, but—it’s the </p><p>Jekri tribe up there. They’re an ugly bunch to </p><p>deal with.” </p><p> He gets into a small launch or canoe and goes off</p><p>with blacks whom he can not talk to, into a strange </p><p>world of dense forests and glassy waters—strange </p><p>vegetation, strange animals, strange skies. He has </p><p>long, unfilled hours in which to brood himself into </p><p>“funkitis.” Eventually he arrives at the trading- </p><p>station, which is probably a rat-infested blackened </p><p>and ancient hulk moored to the jungle. The exile </p><p>there is pitifully' relieved to sec him. docs not try </p><p>to disguise the fact that to go home is to go from </p><p>hell to heaven, and with a view of “putting him </p><p>next” morbidly paints the treachery of the natives, </p><p>the deadliness of the rainy season, the awfulness </p><p>of the loneliness, the insidious peculiarities and </p><p>varieties of fever. </p><p> “Are you well-stocked in quinine? You’d better</p><p>see that your nigger tastes your chow bt-fore you </p><p>eat; not that that is much of a safeguard, for he’ll </p><p>poison you himself if he takes a fancy to the pants </p><p>you’re wearing. There’s an interpreter here you'll </p><p>have to watch pretty close. Don’t present your </p><p>back to him. He carries a knife in his loin-cloth </p><p>and is a member of a secret society among the </p><p>blacks that is set on ridding the country of us </p><p>whites. You’ve got to be mighty careful, too, </p><p>not to offend their ju-ju superstitions. Did you </p><p>bring a deck of cards? If it hadn’t been for solitaire </p><p>I’d have gone crazy to know' how to kill time. The </p><p>white ants ate up my grips. D’ye want to sell </p><p>me your kit-bag? Ten-to-one you won't have any </p><p>use for it; this station is the rottenest on the </p><p>Niger.” </p><p> Next day the young man finds himself a lone</p><p>white in a hostile world. Right there he starts </p><p>marking off the calendar and counting the days </p><p>to his relief and estimating his chances of living to </p><p>see it.

It lay at the narrow end of Break- </p><p>neck Gorge, the upper end of which em- </p><p>braced the isolated freak of a house known </p><p>as Cragcastle. </p><p> Lawyer Osborne had told me his recently</p><p>deceased client, John Maxon, had built </p><p>the house. And, in truth, its remoteness </p><p>matched well with that ecc'entric provision </p><p>in his will which had caused me, a stranger </p><p>to everybody concerned, to take up a soli- </p><p>tary residence in Cragcastle. And which, </p><p>as a consequence, gave me the novel expe- </p><p>rience, on the first night of my stay there,</p><p>of sitting across the table from a visitor </p><p>whom I had just admitted and of whom </p><p>I knew absolutely nothing—except that he </p><p>intended to kill me. </p><p> “As soon as I read of your father’s will,”</p><p>said this stranger, “I knew I had you." </p><p> He was and was not a man of pre-</p><p>possessing appearance. Superficially, he </p><p>was handsome—well-formed, well-dressed, </p><p>in the late forties, with quite regular fea- </p><p>tures. A closer look, however, showed </p><p>that he had a coldly sensual mouth and a </p><p>brutal jaw and that liis eyes were bloodshot. </p><p>Crookdom and the underworld know such </p><p>faces well; they are the natural result of </p><p>years of vice and vicious profiteering </p><p>working upon unusual intelligence as a </p><p>basis. In my own person I should probably </p><p>never have known this man well enough to </p><p>have had him for an enemy. </p><p> “Your father probably figured," he went</p><p>on, “that, if you were a coward, you </p><p>wouldn’t come back, and, if you changed </p><p>into a man of passable courage, fit to be </p><p>his son, you would. That was where he </p><p>made a mistake. You came back, and </p><p>still you're a coward. Li fact, you came </p><p>back because you're a coward. The money </p><p>you stole was all gone, of course. And you </p><p>figured I was probably dead or gone or </p><p>broken mentally—which last I might well </p><p>bt—and you'd rather take a chance ou </p><p>facing me than a certainty of beach- </p><p>combing it the rest of your life. A hundred </p><p>thousand is worth taking a chance for— </p><p>and even worth living in this mansion a </p><p>year for. Though mainly—” his eyes flitted </p><p>around the bare room—“it isn’t fit to house </p><p>ghosts in, and I hope yours will be—un- </p><p>comfortable.” </p><p> Herein liis animosity caused him to</p><p>exaggerate. True, the room in which </p><p>we sat contained little else than our two </p><p>chairs and the old oak table on which he </p><p>had ordered me—somewhat to my amuse- </p><p>ment—to keep my hands. But that was </p><p>because I'd carefully denuded it of every- </p><p>thing else—sofas, chairs and the like— </p><p>before he came in. Even while he urged </p><p>the masquerade on me. Osborne had very </p><p>earnestly warned me against personal </p><p>danger, and I wanted to make quite sure </p><p>that, if I had a caller, we should sit where </p><p>we did. </p><p> Really, Cragcastle was a fine rambling—</p><p>or rather climbing—old country house, </p><p>quite comfortably supplied, even to a tele- </p><p>phone and electric light and heat.</p><p>56 </p><p>Rogues’ End </p><p>57 </p><p> But I suppose Hardridge, as my visitor</p><p>had named himself, referred mainly to its </p><p>isolation, perched as it was five hundred </p><p>yards up the seaward slope of Mount </p><p>Tamalpais, five miles from the nearest </p><p>village and four from the nearest house. </p><p> I replied that he was hard to please,</p><p>since the setting couldn't be beaten for a </p><p>murder. </p><p> And indeed Hardridge seemed outwardly</p><p>to have every chance of accomplishing his </p><p>intention. We both believed we were </p><p>alone in the house; he had also made </p><p>certain that I carried no weapon, and Ire </p><p>himself held an effective-looking revolver </p><p>in a clearly efficient hand. But he rested </p><p>that hand on the table, with the gun pointed </p><p>only in my general direction; so I could </p><p>have concluded the scene at any moment. </p><p>However, I didn’t want to check him yet, </p><p>there being too much I wanted to know to </p><p>let slip a chance for knowledge. </p><p> On his part, up to now Hardridge had</p><p>been enjoying himself perfectly well in </p><p>gloating over my supposed helplessness. </p><p>Assassins are usually rhetoricians as well— </p><p>which fact has saved many lives. </p><p> “However,” I added, “I’ll probably be</p><p>as comiortable as you, dead or alive. For, </p><p>of course, there'll be no doubt as to who </p><p>killed me. In fact, Osborne warned me </p><p>against you before I came over. He’s the </p><p>executor, you know. You’ll either hang </p><p>or go to San Quentin-” </p><p> At that last word Hardridge’s face went</p><p>livid. His revolver flashed up, and for an </p><p>instant I thought we were both dead men. </p><p> “- you.” he cried—it was his first</p><p>touch of real passion—“cut that. Don’t </p><p>you dare-’’ </p><p> “For a longer term than I caused you</p><p>to get last time,” I went on steadily. </p><p>“That'll be some consolation to my ghost.” </p><p>Few men will fire in the middle of </p><p>another man’s sentence; that was one </p><p>reason I completed mine. But there was </p><p>another reason, too. His outburst par- </p><p>tially confirmed a suspicion certain of his </p><p>remarks and certain things in his appearance </p><p>had given me—that he had been in prison </p><p>and believed I had sent him there, and I </p><p>wanted to prove or disprove it. </p><p> You see, I hadn’t yet learned why he</p><p>wanted to kill me. </p><p> “You think so,” he rasped, lowering his</p><p>revolver. “Well, you’ll not have that </p><p>comfort. Those of the ring that are left </p><p>are back of me in this, and they’ll see me </p><p>through. Because you’re a traitor doesn't </p><p>prove all men are. Because I trusted you </p><p>doesn’t prove I'm altogether a fool, either. </p><p>My getaway is safe. And I've money, too. </p><p>Plenty of it. My pro rain in that pool you </p><p>stole didn’t break me bv a long shot, </p><p>though it did break most of the others. </p><p>No, John Maxon, it’s not prison but life </p><p>that’s ahead of me—life!” he exulted. </p><p>“And for you, deaLh and the fishes! For </p><p>I’ll drop you into the bay; I wouldn't </p><p>poison the earth with you. Pah! Nothing </p><p>but poisonous toadstools could come irom </p><p>your carcass.’’ </p><p> It's not easy to hear oneself reviled so</p><p>and make no defense, but I could hardly </p><p>have opened my mouth without betraying </p><p>that I wasn’t the man he thought me. </p><p>Wliat I had gotten from Hardridge so far </p><p>was not as much knowledge as food for </p><p>conjecture. As for the smooth-talking </p><p>lawyer, Osborne, who’d drawn me into the </p><p>affair and got me to come to Cragcastle, </p><p>he’d really said nothing about Hardridge </p><p>but only warned me against danger in </p><p>general. </p><p> Anyway, I placed little confidence in</p><p>anyUiing Osborne had told me. His ap- </p><p>pearance of candor had been too perfect </p><p>to be genuine. I’ve learned to beware of </p><p>the confessed rascal who looks me straight </p><p>in the eye—there’s always some other </p><p>deviltry hidden behind his confession. </p><p>This, I was sure, was Osborne's case. </p><p>Although the will itself—John Maxon, </p><p>Sr.’s, disposing of Cragcastle and the rest oi </p><p>the Maxon estate—was evidently genuine. </p><p> Osborne had calmly proposed to me. a</p><p>stranger, a plan involving false impersona- </p><p>tion, perjury, theft and perhaps a few </p><p>other violations of the law. Profit, about </p><p>fifty thousand each. I couldn't pick out </p><p>the unsound spots in his proposal, except </p><p>that he wasn’t a man wrho would be content </p><p>to divide such profits evenly. Naturally </p><p>I wanted to see what was behind his </p><p>proposal, and a week must necessarily </p><p>elapse before I could sail on my own busi- </p><p>ness; so I came in with him. </p><p> I came the more readily since I knew</p><p>I really needed some amusment to take </p><p>my mind off the absorbing problem into </p><p>which I would presently plunge It can </p><p>hardly be hinted at in the present con- </p><p>nection, but, if you remember that throne-</p><p>shattering society, the Ko Lao Hui, the </p><p>53 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>part it played in die Chinese revolution </p><p>and the part it would have played had its </p><p>monstrous leader, Koshinga, lived, then </p><p>you’ll know what it meant when the word </p><p>was passed to a few of us that Koshinga </p><p>had not died. Or, rather, that a eertain </p><p>man had arisen in China who claimed to </p><p>be Koshinga. China has been my hobby </p><p>for years—anti in face of this rumor I was </p><p>chained to San Francisco for a week. </p><p> But, to return, within twenty-four hours</p><p>after meeting Osborne I took up my solitary </p><p>residence in Cragcastle, which was the </p><p>peculiar punishment, test or merely eccen- </p><p>tric requirement imposed by the senior </p><p>Maxon’s will upon his only son and heir. </p><p>At ten o’clock of my first evening there </p><p>Osborne’s warning of immediate danger </p><p>had been substantiated. In answer to a </p><p>knock, 1 had opened the door, and Hard- </p><p>ridge had thrust his revolver against my </p><p>chest. </p><p> To his desire to punish before killing, to</p><p>view my writhing soul as weli as my writh- </p><p>ing body, I probably owed my life. But </p><p>I'd disappointed him in the first respect, </p><p>and I felt he would soon seek the ultimate </p><p>satisfaction. </p><p> “You’re far from complimentary,” I said.</p><p>“Crook, coward, traitor—well, maybe I’m </p><p>all three. -But you haven't yet accused </p><p>me of being a fool, and a fool I’d certainly </p><p>be if I came and played with death in this </p><p>house without seeing to my cards. And </p><p>would a coward sit in such a game quite as </p><p>calmly as I’m sitting unless he was sui'e </p><p>he held the winning hand?” </p><p> I could tell by the violence of his re-</p><p>joinder that these two questions had been </p><p>troubling him all along. </p><p> “A cur like you—” he began.</p><p> I didn’t feel like enduring any more;</p><p>so I raised my right hand, that had never </p><p>shifted from its first position on the table, </p><p>a short three inches. The movement/- </p><p>caught his attention, and his eyes shifted </p><p>to the taut string that extended downward </p><p>from my closed hand, and disappeared </p><p>through a hole in the top of the table. </p><p>AND the sentence he had begun </p><p>died on his lips. It was inter- </p><p>esdng to note how, like a weakening </p><p>shadow, uncertainty flitted over his face. </p><p>There’s no threat so unnerving as a mys- </p><p>tery.</p><p> I smiled.</p><p> “Puzzling, isn’t it? If I were to lower</p><p>the top—so—and curve it—so—it forms a </p><p>question-mark. Well, I’ll answer the </p><p>question.” 1 pulled the string taut again </p><p>and caught his eyes and held them. “The </p><p>other end of the string—” I measured </p><p>my words—“is tied to the trigger of an </p><p>automatic. The muzzle is about two </p><p>inches from your vest. You may feel of it </p><p>if you like. </p><p> “Oh,” I added swiftly as almost brainless</p><p>rage Hashed into his eyes, “you’d be willing </p><p>to die killing me, of course. But you can’t.; </p><p>I’ve made sure of that. I can riddle you </p><p>with bullets before you can get your re- </p><p>volver up, and the shock of the first one </p><p>will destroy your aim. That's right; sit </p><p>still— There—” as his left hand stole </p><p>under the edge of the table—“touch it </p><p>lightly, for your health’s sake. You see. </p><p>Now put your hand on the table again </p><p>and shove your revolver across the table </p><p>with your finger-dps, butt forward. </p><p> “Don’t be foolish.” I said reasonably</p><p>as he hesitated. “Don't you understand </p><p>I’m going to let you go and give you another </p><p>chance for murder and myself another </p><p>chance for entertainment?” </p><p> “Don’t tell me that,” rasped Hardridge</p><p>roughly but obeying me nevertheless. </p><p>“What's your game? Why don’t you </p><p>end it?” </p><p> Of course, I was playing the part of</p><p>John Maxon, Jr., badly—that is. judg- </p><p>ing from Hardndge's conception of that </p><p>gentleman. But to act as Hardridge sug- </p><p>gested might involve unpleasant conse- </p><p>quences, being myself without the law. </p><p>Then, too. Hardridge was the only possible </p><p>open sesame I knew of to the mystery of </p><p>Osbornes real motive in persuading me </p><p>into my present masquerade. </p><p> “We all change with the years,” I said</p><p>carelessly. “You mav leave when vou </p><p>like.” </p><p> I picked his revolver up, glanced at it,</p><p>leveled it at him and arose. </p><p> “But next time—” I hinted.</p><p> “Next time,” he grated harshly, “you</p><p>get no chance for monkey-shines'” </p><p> “Thanks!” I said. “Good night!”</p><p> He got to his feet slowly and turned away</p><p>slowly, glaring at me the while and plainly </p><p>loath’ to go. The fury that was in his eyes, </p><p>the fixed hatred that smoldered behind </p><p>it, told me what a dangerous enemy I was </p><p>loosing. And no wonder. For it was I,</p><p>Rogues’ End </p><p>59 </p><p>according to his evident belief, who had </p><p>wreaked havoc upon his life and con- </p><p>demned him to years of solitary brooding </p><p>in a prison cell. </p><p> I recalled with an inward grimace how</p><p>Osborne had shaken hands with me that </p><p>morning and wished me well, knowing, </p><p>as he must have known, that I was marked </p><p>for the vengeance of this man. What </p><p>chance had he really-felt there was that he </p><p>would ever see me again? Or had it really </p><p>been his belief—and possibly his hope— </p><p>that I’d kill Hardridge instead? Every </p><p>thread of the tangle went back to the </p><p>central mystery of Osborne’s purpose in </p><p>the matter. </p><p> I remembered that I had had to give</p><p>some proof* of my ability to take care of </p><p>myself in a pinch before Osborne would </p><p>open negotiations with me at all. Surely </p><p>that indicated no desire to furnish Hard- </p><p>ridge with a victim. </p><p> Mystified as I was, however, I think I did</p><p>not permit Hardridge to guess it, and it </p><p>was with an intent to carry the tiling off </p><p>lightly that I said to liim— </p><p> ‘‘I suppose you’ll haunt the house like a</p><p>specter and all that sort of thing.” </p><p> “By -, you know I will,” he shot</p><p>viciously over his shoulder. </p><p> Letting him go was really taking a little</p><p>flyer in Death, Limited, and I knew it. </p><p> Then happened the second peculiar thing</p><p>of the night. Just as Hardridge put out </p><p>his hand to open the door, in the silence, </p><p>following the cessation of our footsteps, </p><p>I heard unmistakably the sound of some </p><p>one else moving in the house. </p><p> It was difficult to believe, for early in</p><p>the afternoon I had carefully barred all </p><p>doors and windows. It could hardly be </p><p>an accomplice of Hartridge, but, to cover </p><p>the sound from him, I asked him if he had </p><p>another gun and ran my hand over his </p><p>pockets. His snarl at my touch was like a </p><p>wild beast’s. </p><p> “Then you may need this one,” I said</p><p>as I pushed him out into the night. </p><p> And, as I closed the door upon him,</p><p>I	flung his revolver after him. The act</p><p>was, I think, based upon sound strategic </p><p>principles. It would be very easy for him to </p><p>get another gun but very difficult to forget </p><p>my carelessness as to whether he had one. </p><p> But, the moment the key was turned in</p><p>the lock, I wiiirled and darted across the</p><p>room. The inner door of the room opened </p><p>into a hall that ran the length of the house. </p><p>I passed through that door and was about </p><p>to cross the hall into the parlor opposite </p><p>when another sound decided me. I ran </p><p>down the hall and through the first door </p><p>to the left into the library, which adjoined </p><p>the parlor to the rear. After fumbling for </p><p>a moment for the electric light switch, </p><p>I finally found it. </p><p> I'd been prepared for strange things when</p><p>I came to Cragcastle. Indeed, the remote- </p><p>ness and solitude of its setting, surrounded </p><p>by miles of black rock and chaparral- </p><p>covered mountainside, save to the east, </p><p>where the water eternally beat and lapped </p><p>against its foundations, gave the house an </p><p>appearance of being fashioned for mystery </p><p>and framed in it. And my interview with </p><p>Hardridge had been sufficiently remarkable </p><p>to have prepared me for almost anything. </p><p>Nevertheless, I admit my credulity was </p><p>staggered then. </p><p> A woman’s figure flashed through the</p><p>doorway that led back into the parlor. </p><p>The door slammed shut behind her. </p><p> It was in no gentle mood that I pursued</p><p>her. Remember, to me she was at best a </p><p>housebreaker, and I suppose my nerves </p><p>were somewhat tense and jumpy, too. </p><p>She got into the hall before I caught her arm </p><p>in a grip that must have hurt, and I'm </p><p>afraid it was with scant courtesy that I </p><p>drew her back into the parlor. </p><p> But, once there and the Tights turned on,</p><p>I like to remember I released her quickly. </p><p> “I beg your pardon, miss,” I said.</p><p>II </p><p>IT’S been a saving principle of mine </p><p>to apply as little thought as possible </p><p>to feminine beauty. This from, </p><p>I hope, no innate lack of appreciation in </p><p>me—but I’ll omit self-analysis and simplv </p><p>say that it was something more than beauty </p><p>that made me instinctively apologize to the </p><p>intruder. Character was stamped on her </p><p>sensitive yet sanely strong and sensible </p><p>face. Whatever the reason for her presence </p><p>in Cragcastle, it could not be a guilty </p><p>one, and suddenly I felt guilty under the </p><p>blazing wrath of her clear blue eyes. As </p><p>for the unveiled contempt in them, it was </p><p>as hard to endure as it was, for a moment, </p><p>to understand. </p><p> But, when she spoke, I understood it—</p><p>at least in part. </p><p>6o </p><p>Adventure</p><p> “Well, Cousin John,” with icy bitterness,</p><p>“what are you going to do?” </p><p> She, too, like Hardridge, had imme-</p><p>diately accepted me in my assumed char- </p><p>acter of John Maxon. That was quite </p><p>natural, for who else would be occupying </p><p>Cragcastle? But to be addressed by her </p><p>as “Cousin” was somewhat different. The </p><p>late John Maxon, Jr., had, according </p><p>to Osborne, no near relatives at all. That </p><p>had been one of Osborne’s best arguments </p><p>why I might, in safety and with no great </p><p>moral guilt, lake his place. If it had been </p><p>a lie, Osborne must have known I would </p><p>very shortly discover it. I suppose my </p><p>stare at the girl must have been quite </p><p>idiotic. </p><p> “Have you come back witless as well as</p><p>everything else?” she asked sharply. “Can’t </p><p>you speak?” </p><p> I could see that under the surface she</p><p>was really frightened. She was trying the </p><p>old device of simulating—and perhaps </p><p>stimulating—courage by hard words. </p><p> “I’m naturally astonished,” I said.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” </p><p> “Merely paying a cousinly call, of</p><p>course.” She laughed mirthlessly. </p><p> “I think you'd better answer me,” I told</p><p>her quietly. “This is my house; it’s nearly </p><p>midnight; you’ve evidently gained entrance </p><p>by steal til. In other words, you’re in the </p><p>position of a common burglar. The fact </p><p>that you’re my cousin will not prevent </p><p>me from turning you over to the police.” </p><p> “I suppose not. The tarred stick would</p><p>blacken the whole branch. The family </p><p>name-” </p><p> “You should have thought of that before</p><p>breaking into my house.” It was a rare </p><p>part, for me, playing the stem landlord. </p><p> “I’m not begging,” she replied tartly.</p><p>“Do what you will. Of course, you know </p><p>what I’m doing here. There’s only one </p><p>thing worth coming for—and that by </p><p>rights belongs to me, anyway. Or rather, </p><p>to my father. If your father hadn’t </p><p>stolen it——” </p><p> “What do you mean? Don’t say that.”</p><p>“He did, and you know it. It belonged </p><p>to father. It w'as willed to him—all he </p><p>got out of the estate—because he was the </p><p>eldest son. It’s always been so, and grand- </p><p>father wouldn’t break the chain even for </p><p>your father’s lies. Then it disappeared. </p><p>Who could have taken it except the man </p><p>who got everything else, who had every </p><p>opportunity—your father! Why, didn’t</p><p>he tell fa tier he had it—gloat over it— </p><p>and that it would never be discovered save </p><p>by his son, you?” </p><p> 1 was getting quite beyond my depth.</p><p>One thing was clear, however; 1 was </p><p>relieved of all obligation toward Lawyer </p><p>Osborne. By his multiplied falsehoods </p><p>he had discredited once more the prettv </p><p>bedraggled saying, “Honor among thieves.” </p><p>Moreover, it seemed likely I might progress </p><p>faster in solving the riddle if I doffed my </p><p>mask before this girl—in whose presence, </p><p>I admit, the wearing of it had become </p><p>rather odious.	-</p><p> “Why, no.” I said. “I must admit all</p><p>that’s a riddle to me. Because, you see, </p><p>I’m not your cousin.”	•</p><p> “Not my—cousin?”</p><p> In her bewilderment and increased fear</p><p>she retreated a step, her hand going up as </p><p>if to ward me off. </p><p> “Merely an imposter,” I told her as</p><p>gently as I could, “but, I assure you, </p><p>a perfectly harmless one. Your cousin </p><p>being dead, 1 planned to take his place— </p><p>for a day or so, and-” </p><p> In the middle of my stumbling half-</p><p>explanation I observed incredulity come </p><p>into her face, part of which, I flattered </p><p>myself, was caused by a new and swift </p><p>appraisal of me. </p><p> “But that’s impossible,” she interrupted.</p><p>“Thank you,” I said, “but it's unfor- </p><p>tunately true.” </p><p> “But how'— I don’t understand! Oh,</p><p>it isn’t possible!” </p><p> Neither could I understand why her</p><p>credulity had passed so swiftly into absolute </p><p>disbelief. Her only question now seemed </p><p>to be as to my motive in denying myself. </p><p> It was unpleasant. I’m not accustomed</p><p>to having my word doubted, and I par- </p><p>ticularly wanted to be believed by this girl. </p><p>So I told her as convincingly as possible </p><p>and in as few’ words the whole story of mv </p><p>presence in Cragcastle. </p><p> I’d really been brought into touch with</p><p>Lawyer Osborne through a want ad., </p><p>obviously designed to attract every near- </p><p>respectable world tramp in San Francisco </p><p>between certain age, weight and height </p><p>limits. Osborne had quizzed me until he </p><p>discovered that I had no acquaintances </p><p>within a thousand miles and that I appar- </p><p>ently matched his misuse of the law </p><p>with a profound contempt for it—which, </p><p>Rogues’ End </p><p>61</p><p>incidentally, was his error. Then he’d told </p><p>me that one of his clients, John Maxon, </p><p>had just died; that his son and only heir, </p><p>John Maxon, Jr., had been killed about </p><p>the same time in a saloon brawl in Hong </p><p>Kong; that this son had been absent </p><p>about five years, a ne’er-do-well wanderer, </p><p>much of the time under assumed names; </p><p>that in feature and stature I bore a very </p><p>strong resemblance to him, and that only </p><p>he, Osborne, knew of this son’s death. </p><p> Osborne’s proposal was, of course, that</p><p>I substitute for this dead son, which I </p><p>might do the more easily since a freak </p><p>provision in old man Maxon’s will provided </p><p>that his son live alone in Cragcastle six </p><p>months before inheriting. This evidently </p><p>because he had fled from some danger and </p><p>his father wished to test his courage and </p><p>worthiness—but of this Osborne knew </p><p>nothing. At the end of six months my </p><p>identity as John Maxon would be easily </p><p>established—to Osborne’s satisfaction, at </p><p>least—and Osborne and I would split the </p><p>estate. </p><p> WHILE I was telling her this, the</p><p>girl's expression gradually changed </p><p>from incredulity to utter amaze- </p><p>ment, and she apparently had hard work </p><p>to keep from interrupting me. At the end, </p><p>after hesitating a moment, she confounded </p><p>me and upset my whole tale by four as- </p><p>tounding words— </p><p> “But John isn’t dead.”</p><p> “What!”</p><p> The girl’s confidence came slowly. But,</p><p>after all, I had given her mine, and frank- </p><p>ness begets frankness. Finally, after ap- </p><p>parently considering the matter, she went </p><p>on: </p><p> “No! At least he sailed from China</p><p>alive. Osborne himself showed me his </p><p>cable at date of sailing. Then I have a </p><p>letter he wrote a few days before—a very </p><p>brief business letter. We weren’t friends. </p><p>His ship reached San Francisco last Satur- </p><p>day.” </p><p> “Then Osborne lied all around,” I said</p><p>slowly. “After all, I sensed it. But, in </p><p>the name of reason, why?” </p><p> It appeared like a stiff enough problem,</p><p>but I was more than ever glad I’d come to </p><p>Cragcastle. </p><p> The girl continued to regard me ap-</p><p>praisingly, cautiously, but I seemed to </p><p>have leaped several points in her estimation </p><p>from legal cousin to illegal imposter— </p><p>as strong a commentary- as I’d yet had on</p><p>John Maxon’s character. Nevertheless, I </p><p>still considered her apparent lack of fear </p><p>as largely brave subterfuge, and I tried </p><p>hard to reassure her. We were both </p><p>searchers—I for the truth, she for some- </p><p>thing materially valuable—and, if I could </p><p>win her confidence, there might be a chance </p><p>of mutual help. </p><p> “I want you to believe,” I told her</p><p>earnestly and truthfully, “that I didn't </p><p>intend to go through with the thing. </p><p>Curiosity isn't wholly a feminine vice. </p><p>Miss Maxon. I knew Osborne was lying, </p><p>and I wanted to see what was really in his </p><p>mind. And he never said a word about </p><p>you. According to him, John Maxon </p><p>was the only heir. I thought I’d step </p><p>into the affair without troubling any one, </p><p>and get out the same way. If I'd really </p><p>intended to stick, would I have confessed </p><p>my masquerade to you as quickly as I did?” </p><p> I still think that last was a logical argu-</p><p>ment, and it was to that I returned several </p><p>times during the five minutes talk that </p><p>followed. But perhaps the reason Miss </p><p>Maxon finally permitted herself to believe </p><p>me was that she wanted to. Perhaps she </p><p>had all the time held the idea of enlisting </p><p>me in her own search. But, when I finally </p><p>brought the talk around to it again, she </p><p>refused to discuss it. </p><p> “No,” she said. “It doesn’t matter.</p><p>I shouldn’t have come, anyhow. Oh, I must </p><p>go now.” </p><p> And she made a hurried move as if to</p><p>escape into the night. </p><p> At that I suddenly remembered that</p><p>Death watched Cragcastle that night, and, </p><p>though I stood squarely in her path, I </p><p>refused to stir. </p><p> “Wait!” I said earnestly. “I’ve some-</p><p>thing else to tell you. Something for your </p><p>own safety. Tell me first when and how </p><p>you came here and how you got into the </p><p>house?” </p><p> “Why, I walked out from the village—</p><p>Mill Valiev*, I mean—this morning. I had </p><p>a bundle of old keys and finally got the </p><p>front door open. I was here when you </p><p>came. We had a fine game of hide-and- </p><p>seek, though you didn’t know it. I thought </p><p>I’d escape discovery till you went to sleep </p><p>and then leave,” </p><p> “After searching a little more. I suppose.'</p><p>I supplied. “Well, you came out of your </p><p>6 2 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>hiding-place to see if I’d settled down,</p><p>and— Did you hear voices just before </p><p>I caught you?” </p><p> “Yes."</p><p> And then 1 told her of my interview</p><p>with Hardridge and tried to make it clear </p><p>to her that it would be difficult to leave </p><p>Cragcastle that night without stopping a </p><p>bullet. I argued the more convincingly </p><p>because even then, in a nebulous way, the </p><p>plan I later acted on was forming in my </p><p>mind. </p><p> But, to put it through, I must win Miss</p><p>Maxon’s confidence completely. </p><p> My exact arguments don’t matter. And,</p><p>anyway, the personal element figures mainly </p><p>in matters of this kind. Any one would </p><p>find it hard to tell me why she should not </p><p>have stayed in the house. And she ad- </p><p>mitted, at last, that no one would be </p><p>concerned about her whereabouts. She </p><p>was teaching in San Bernardino, had come </p><p>north during the few days of vacation and </p><p>was merely registered at one of the San </p><p>Francisco hotels. </p><p> After that she quite readily told me</p><p>the object of her search in Cragcastle. </p><p>I’d already divined that it was family </p><p>jewelry; she centered the search to a single </p><p>sapphire—a sapphire that had come down </p><p>in the Maxon family for many generations, </p><p>always from telder son to elder son, until </p><p>John Maxon, Sr., had broken the chain. </p><p>He was the younger of two brothers and the </p><p>favorite with their father. Indeed, be- </p><p>tween the other son and their parent had </p><p>come a wide estrangement—the girl gave </p><p>me to understand that it was through some </p><p>machination on the part of John Maxon. </p><p>Anyway, all the family estate had been </p><p>willed to John Maxon, except only' the </p><p>famous sapphire—and that had disap- </p><p>peared. </p><p> And Miss Maxon was sure her uncle,</p><p>John Maxon, had stolen it and, being un- </p><p>willing to dispose of it and unable to display </p><p>it, had kept it hidden all these years. She </p><p>said he had even boasted of the theft to </p><p>her father. And she was sure it was still </p><p>in Cragcastle, where he had suddenly and </p><p>unexpectedly died. </p><p> Was it? It seemed a fantastic tale but</p><p>not an incredible one. A great gem and </p><p>family strife—how related are the two </p><p>ideas! And I had — considering the </p><p>proverb, “Like father, like son”—no reason </p><p>to think over highly of the paternal an- </p><p>cestor of John Maxon, Jr. He might </p><p>easil) be a man who would steal for spite</p><p>and gloat over his stealings in secret. Of </p><p>all forms of wealth, jewels lend themselves </p><p>most easily to this form of vice—as witness </p><p>history. Truly the love of jewels—but </p><p>1 suppose my belief in Esther Maxon's </p><p>story was very largely based on my real </p><p>desire to help her. </p><p> “Please don't think that—that it’s for</p><p>myself. But my father’s quite ill—has </p><p>been for years. He's never had—proper </p><p>care. 1 don’t make enough as a teacher, </p><p>and, if we could get the sapphire and sell </p><p>it-” </p><p> “1 11 get it for you/’ I said. “Or 1 think</p><p>I can.” </p><p> For her tale of the sapphire had given</p><p>me the second half of the idea I needed. </p><p> “Oh! How?”</p><p> “Not by searching. We might search</p><p>a year and never find it. Your uncle had </p><p>a good many years to contrive a hiding- </p><p>place. But, if it's in this house, I think </p><p>I can get it. I’ll try, anyway.” </p><p> I wasn't too sure. But. if my mental</p><p>laborings had borne true fruit—if I'd </p><p>judged accurately the character of the </p><p>suddenly resurrected John Maxon and his </p><p>motive in having Osborne inveigle me into </p><p>impersonating him at Cragcastle—then we </p><p>had a chance. </p><p> For, of course, if John Maxon were alive,</p><p>he was the principal, Osborne only the </p><p>agent. I thought it quite clear, too, why </p><p>he should temporarily desire an understudy </p><p>in the play called life. In short, I simply </p><p>took for granted the truth of Hardridge s </p><p>description of him, thought what such a </p><p>man would do in such a case as he had </p><p>found himself on reading his father’s will— </p><p>and in such and such another case—and </p><p>mapped my moves accordingly. </p><p> Without telling her any tiling of my plan,</p><p>I finally got Miss Maxon to retire for the </p><p>night. Indeed, she was very tired. There </p><p>were bedrooms in the second story of the </p><p>house, and 1 led her to one that had strong </p><p>shutters over the window and confidence- </p><p>inspiring bolts. </p><p> Then I went to the cellar, got twenty</p><p>feet of light rope and passed through the </p><p>house again to the front door. Taking </p><p>my revolver in my hand, I opened the door </p><p>and darted through it. Hastily I turned </p><p>the key in the lock. Then I leaped away </p><p>from the door and across the roadway </p><p>Rogues' End </p><p>63 </p><p> into a narrow trail that led through</p><p> the chaparral down the mountainside.</p><p> Throughout I made it appear that I was</p><p> rather clumsily and nervously trying to</p><p> escape unseen.</p><p> Of course, my intention was precisely</p><p> the opposite.</p><p> I assumed that Hardridge would be as</p><p> easily fooled in such matters as the average</p><p> city-bred man.</p><p>Ill </p><p> IT WAS a quite dark night. A</p><p> ■j&amp;S? low, thin mist had drifted up from</p><p> the sea, and through it the light</p><p> of the stars and of a ghostly hall-moon</p><p> filtered uncertainly. From the beginning</p><p> of the trail I looked back a scant twenty</p><p> yards to the house and saw only a bulky</p><p> gray shadow. Besides that and the near-by</p><p> chaparral I could see nothing. The light</p><p> of the string of villages from the foot of</p><p> Tamalpais to the ferry passage, the inter-</p><p> mittent flash of Alcatraz and even the</p><p> white radiance that San Francisco usually</p><p> flings against the sky were all blotted out</p><p> by the mist.</p><p> So, although I knew that humanity,</p><p> society and the law were all very close at</p><p> hand, it didn’t seem so strange that I should</p><p> be crouching primitively in the edge of the</p><p> brush, my nerves strung up, straining my</p><p> senses for a sign of Hardridge.</p><p> Which wasn’t long coming. The</p><p> chaparral crackled to my right. A cautious</p><p> foot planted itself on the roadway—I</p><p> judged about thirty paces lower down.</p><p> There were more footsteps; Hardridge</p><p> came closer. Just when, by craning my</p><p> neck out of the brush, I could see him</p><p> outlined shadowily, I made a slight noise</p><p> with my foot. Instantly a revolver</p><p> cracked, and the bullet hit the road a</p><p> little beyond me.</p><p> And instantly I had turned and was</p><p> moving cautiously—yet not so cautiously</p><p> that Hardridge could not hear my move-</p><p> ments—down the trail.</p><p>Hardridge, of course, started in pursuit, </p><p>as I had intended, and—ostensibly hunted, </p><p>really hunter—I quickened my flight. I </p><p>made only enough noise so that the sound </p><p>. of my movements would come to Hard- </p><p>| ridge’s ears above the noise of his own. </p><p>f Which was really considerable. Hard- </p><p>ridge’s pursuit, at once freighted by excess </p><p>of caution and hurried by hate, was so </p><p>laughably awkward that I knew—barring </p><p>accidents—I'd be able to accomplish at </p><p>least the first item of my plan.</p><p> The trail here descended sharply. On</p><p>both sides the shrubbery was as thick </p><p>as an abandoned vineyard. Here and </p><p>there low chaparral thrust arresting, thorn- </p><p>tipped branches across the trail and tore </p><p>at my flesh and clothing. Underfoot the </p><p>ground was uneven, uncertain, strewn with </p><p>small stones that were easily dislodged and </p><p>with dead leaves that crackled. Still I </p><p>was able in some way to control the sound </p><p>of my passage and to move with less and </p><p>less of noise every minute. </p><p> Hardridge was now about twenty yards</p><p>behind me, but he was rapidly lessening </p><p>the distance. Also, he was rapidly lessen- </p><p>ing his caution. Probably the diminishing </p><p>sound of my flight excited him with the </p><p>thought that I was escaping. Now and </p><p>then I purposely broke a twig or brushed </p><p>a branch so he’d know I w’as still in motion. </p><p>Once, straightening up. I thrust my head </p><p>above the chaparral. He fired, but I had </p><p>ducked out of sight again before his finger </p><p>jerked the trigger. I intended the move- </p><p>ment to enrage him still further, like a </p><p>mocking gesture. </p><p> The game was, I suppose, slightly unfair,</p><p>for Hardridge was blinded both by passion </p><p>and inexperience. But he had brought it </p><p>on himself. Besides, as things stood now, </p><p>I was really working toward the end Hard- </p><p>ridge himself desired. At least I so </p><p>believed. </p><p> A little farther and my flight ended.</p><p>The trail led straight on, but to the right </p><p>a narrow opening between two clumps of </p><p>shrubbery attracted me. I stopped oppo- </p><p>site that opening, drew up my feet and </p><p>backed into it. Then I picked up a pebble </p><p>and tossed it down the trail. It struck </p><p>the ground perhaps five yards beyond where </p><p>I lay and bounced and rolled a little. </p><p> Hardridge probably believed, as I in-</p><p>tended he should, that the pebble had been </p><p>dislodged by my foot. Anyway, he came </p><p>blindly 011 until I could have reached out </p><p>and touched him. There he stopped as if </p><p>he had sensed my nearness and was men- </p><p>tally feeling for me. If it hadn’t been for </p><p>his labored breatiling, he might have heard </p><p>me stir and set myself for the leap. </p><p> As it was, the butt of my revolver crashed</p><p>against his forehead while he still stood </p><p>64 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>there—waiting, it seemed, for the blow. </p><p>He reeled backward, and I caught him and </p><p>twisted his arms behind his back. He was</p><p>only partially stunned, and he struggled </p><p>feebly while I tied his wrists together. </p><p> “Maxon! - you, Maxon!” he mut-</p><p>tered. And, as full strength and con- </p><p>sciousness came to him with* complete </p><p>realization of his helplessness, the strength </p><p>of his expletives kept pace with his growing </p><p>rage. Nevertheless, 1 could hardly dis- </p><p>agree with most of his expletives as applied </p><p>to die individual whose life I’d borrowed; </p><p>so, while I finished binding his arms securely </p><p>to his body, 1 let him talk on. Then— </p><p> “Why don’t I kill you, dien, if I’m all</p><p>that?” I asked. </p><p> It was my intention to give him a doubt</p><p>to start on. If I’d flatly denied being John </p><p>Maxon, Hardridge would hardly have be- </p><p>lieved me; besides, it wasn’t in the game. </p><p>But it was in the game that he be made </p><p>to regard that possibility—as a possibility. </p><p> “Whyr didn’t I kill you a few hours ago</p><p>or a few minutes or any time between? </p><p>I could’ve, you know. As easily as I could </p><p>kill you now. Of course, you realize that. </p><p>You’re really as helpless out here as an </p><p>infant.” </p><p> “Cut that, you-”</p><p> It is unpleasant to see a man fairly sob</p><p>with rage. I suppose part of that rage </p><p>was at himself for being so easily trapped </p><p>and mastered. </p><p> “I’m going to gag you,” I went on when</p><p>he’d quite finished, “take you back to die </p><p>house and lock you in a closet. There </p><p>you’ll stay all day. You’ll be regularly </p><p>fed; I want you to keep up your strength. </p><p>In fact, I’ve a particular reason for wanting </p><p>it. In the evening you’ll be unbound and </p><p>die gag removed, but you’ll be still kept </p><p>in die closet—and be sure the door of it will </p><p>be covered by my gun. You should know </p><p>by this time that I don’t make mistakes. </p><p>Now, why do you suppose I’m doing all </p><p>that?” </p><p> “How the devil should I know? I sup-</p><p>pose you’re calling in your friends, the </p><p>police.” </p><p> “Try again,” I said. “I needn’t go to</p><p>all that trouble to get the police. But </p><p>Fra merely suggesting that maybe you </p><p>haven’t quite plumbed this thing yet. </p><p>Put your diink-tank to w'ork and try to </p><p>figure things out. You’ll have lots of time </p><p>in that closet.” </p><p> He emitted a sound between a curse and</p><p>a groan. I think he was looking forward </p><p>into those black hours when he’d be alone </p><p>with his hatred, balked, bound and help-</p><p>less. </p><p> “You d better kill me now, John Maxon,”</p><p>ne said. </p><p> “John Maxon probably would,” I replied.</p><p> And then I dapped on the gag, giving</p><p>him that besides a new thought to chew on. </p><p>It was perhaps the impact of that new </p><p>thought on his brain that made him quite </p><p>easy to manage on thejvay back to Crag- </p><p>casde. </p><p> I put him into the hall closet, which was</p><p>built into the wall between the doors of </p><p>the dining-room and reception-room. It </p><p>was small enough that he w-ould have </p><p>practically no liberty of movement even if </p><p>he got free from the rope; the door was </p><p>strong, and I could figure no chance of his </p><p>escape. Nevertheless, I placed a barricade </p><p>of furniture against the wall. Then I went </p><p>to the telephone. </p><p> The wires of which—think of it!—Hard-</p><p>ridge had omitted to cut. I’ve often won- </p><p>dered, of dunderwittedness and crime, </p><p>which is the cause and which the effect. </p><p>Hardridge had been, as I was to learn next </p><p>day, among the higher-ups of crimedom, </p><p>but even he neglected so obvious a thing </p><p>as the cutting of a telephone wire. </p><p>mOF COURSE, I’d provided myself </p><p>with Osborne’s home as well as </p><p>office address, and. bv employing </p><p>the ancient but usually effective catch </p><p>phrase, “Matter of life or death.” I finally </p><p>got a sleepy somebody to promise to call </p><p>him. I admit that, aside from the fact </p><p>that the hour was a suitable one for the </p><p>message I had for him, there was something </p><p>satisfying in the idea of dragging the com- </p><p>fort-loving lawyer from his bed at two in </p><p>the morning. </p><p> “Hello! Hello! Yes, this is Osborne.</p><p>What is it?” </p><p> I hardly recognized the voice whose</p><p>suave tones had drawn me into this ad- </p><p>venture. Irritable as it was, there was </p><p>clearly a touch of nervous dread in it, too. </p><p>That nervous dread, the jerky, frightened </p><p>notes of my own voice were by no means </p><p>intended to allay. </p><p> “This is Part— No, no, I mean it’s</p><p>Maxon. That’s it, John Maxon. Are </p><p>you alone?” </p><p>Rogues’ End </p><p>65 </p><p> It was interesting to notice how the</p><p>alchemy of imagination and an evil con- </p><p>science transmuted my make-believe agi- </p><p>tation into real panic at the other end of the</p><p>wire. Osborne’s voice, when it came again, </p><p>fairly shook. </p><p> “Yes. Practically, that is. I don’t</p><p>think— Wait a minute.” 1 think he </p><p>closed a door. “Now. But be careful over </p><p>the ’phone. What lias happened?” </p><p>“Nothing! That is— Well, I’m leav- </p><p>ing, that’s all. I can’t go through with it. </p><p>That’s aU. Good-” </p><p> “Here, wait a minute,” Osborne cried in</p><p>alarm. “Don’t hang up. Wait a minute. </p><p>Where are you?” </p><p> “In Cragcastle, where you sent me,”</p><p>I said nervously and half angrily. </p><p> “Well— Has any tiling— What’s hap-</p><p>pened?” </p><p> “Nothing. I told you—nothing.”</p><p> “But something has. It must’ve, or</p><p>you wouldn't— You’re right to be careful, </p><p>but I must know. For your sake—pro- </p><p>tection, as well as— Listen! I’ll ask ques- </p><p>tions. I warned you of danger, you re- </p><p>member.” </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Well, did it materialize?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Ah!” Osborne’s voice dropped a key.</p><p>“Is it—ended?” </p><p> He pronounced the last word so signifi-</p><p>cantly that there was no mistaking the </p><p>meaning. It was the lawyer’s safe way of </p><p>asking, over the wire, if Hardridge was </p><p>dead. </p><p> “Yes,” I replied.</p><p> And thought I heard, over the twenty</p><p>miles that separated us, a quick, sharp </p><p>breath of relief. </p><p> “And—and I’m going,” I continued.</p><p>“It’ll be—discovered. I had to-” </p><p> “All right,” he interrupted me sharply.</p><p>“Take care. I quite understand. You </p><p>had to— But I suppose you’re quite </p><p>right—to go away. We’ll have to give up </p><p>the other project.” </p><p> I thought he was almost too quick, for</p><p>realism, to put aside the hope we were both </p><p>supposed to have of dividing the Maxon </p><p>estate. But, of course, I was also sup- </p><p>posed to be quite unsuspicious that our </p><p>contract in regard to that estate was a </p><p>farce and that my function from the be- </p><p>ginning had been to kill or be killed by </p><p>Hardridge. </p><p> “I’m glad you agree. Well, good-by!”</p><p>“Wait a minute. Tell me. Was it only </p><p>one? Was he alone?” </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Have you any money?”</p><p> I was waiting for that question. I knew</p><p>he’d ask it, because both he and his principal </p><p>would certainly desire that I travel far and </p><p>speedily, and I’d led him to believe I was </p><p>penniless. </p><p> I laughed in a self-satisfied a fashion as I</p><p>could manage and threw a touch of im- </p><p>pudent boasting into my tone. </p><p> “Plenty of it.”</p><p> “Good,” said Osborne somewhat per-</p><p>plexedly. “I’m glad of that. But I’d </p><p>like to know— Can’t you tell me-” </p><p> “I’m off,” I warned.</p><p> “Where it is?” he finished desperately.</p><p>“It’ll have to be disposed of, you know. </p><p>Where’ll I—whoever goes over—find it?” </p><p>It was clear, of course, that he spoke of </p><p>Hardridge’s body—another inquiry that it </p><p>was quite inevitable he should make. </p><p> “You might look,” I said with a sort of</p><p>boastful gibe, “near the place old man </p><p>Maxon hid his sapphire.” </p><p> “What’s that? What do you know</p><p>about—” The lawyer’s voice mounted </p><p>excitedly. </p><p> “Goo'd-by.”</p><p> I hung up the receiver.</p><p> A moment later the ’phone began ringing</p><p>furiously as if Osborne had managed to </p><p>communicate to the inanimate instrument </p><p>something of his own agitation. Then </p><p>I cut the wire—as Hardridge should have </p><p>done. </p><p> And I pulled a couch out of the parlor,</p><p>placed it near the door behind which </p><p>Hardridge was imprisoned, lay down on it </p><p>and was soon asleep. Morning was only </p><p>a few hours off, and I was quite confident </p><p>nothing would happen till then. Or, in- </p><p>deed, till the covering darkness of the follow- </p><p>ing night. That is, if I divined correctly </p><p>the nature of the man for whom I waited. </p><p> Which was, of course, not Osborne.</p><p>Osborne was strictly an office worker. He </p><p>might be imagined playing any sort of </p><p>crooked game in the world—but through </p><p>intermediaries only. His own physical </p><p>participation and his own personal peril </p><p>would always be missing elements. No; </p><p>the man who would come to see to the </p><p>safety of the Maxon sapphire would be the </p><p>man who thought it his property—the </p><p>66 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>man who, using Osborne as agent, had </p><p>attempted to bejfool me to his own place </p><p>under the Damoelean sword. </p><p>IV</p><p>LOOKING back, I’ve always felt </p><p>the day that followed was one of </p><p>the most remarkable of my life— </p><p>and I speak of the day, not of the night </p><p>with its element of tragedy. The day was </p><p>remarkable for its very lack of that element </p><p>—for its very unremarkableness. I hold </p><p>that, with such a night as had passed fresh </p><p>in our memories, with Hardridge impris- </p><p>oned, with the arrival of the man whom </p><p>Hardridge had vowed to kill presumably </p><p>impending and with the girl's fortune and </p><p>possibly more than one life depending upon </p><p>the denouement, it was no commonplace </p><p>thing that the day slipped by, to Miss </p><p>Maxon and me, much like a pleasant holi- </p><p>day outing. </p><p> For I finally persuaded her to stay until</p><p>the working out of my plan. Concerning </p><p>which, by the way, I told her as little as </p><p>possible. It’s always much easier to agree </p><p>on an end than on the means, and it doesn’t </p><p>always pay to tell everything even to the </p><p>people in whose interest one may be </p><p>working. </p><p> We talked about a great many things,</p><p>mainly impersonal, and even took several </p><p>short walks. One of those walks took us to </p><p>the place that was then called Land’s End. </p><p>It was Miss Maxon who suggested it; I </p><p>knew nothing until then of the trap-like </p><p>canon at the rear of the house, with its </p><p>wide mouth and narrow exit upon the sea. </p><p>But we had no sooner arrived at the railing </p><p>that guarded that exiL, where we could </p><p>look down some hundred feel into white </p><p>surf, than Miss Maxon was seized with a </p><p>violent fit. of trembling and suggested that </p><p>we return. It was the only sign of real </p><p>agitation I saw in her that day. </p><p> That was late m the afternoon and the</p><p>last time we left the house. </p><p> Breakfast and lunch had been largely</p><p>makeshifts, but dinner that evening was </p><p>a triumph, Osborne having supplied the </p><p>house for my residence fairly well and Miss </p><p>Maxon proving herself a miraculous cook. </p><p>After we’d eaten, I took his share of the </p><p>meal in to Hardridge, whom I found in a </p><p>state of eager expectancy. He evidently </p><p>remembered my promise that he’d be un- </p><p>bound at nightfall, and I didn't disappoint </p><p>him. Instead of standing over him with </p><p>drawn revolver while he ate, as I’d done </p><p>before, I simply released his hands and left, </p><p>him fumbling wildly but with stiff and </p><p>awkward fingers at his gag. I wanted to </p><p>get away from him More lie could ask me</p><p>in words the eager question Lhat had been </p><p>staring out of his overbright eves all day. </p><p> “Now, don’t be a fool," I told him</p><p>through the closing door. “You can't </p><p>get out, and you don’t want to get out, </p><p>and you don’t want to make a noise. Be </p><p>quiet, and you’ll lie-glad of it later/’ </p><p> And I bolted the door without locking it</p><p>and then pressed a button that projected </p><p>from tiie wall near the d&lt;x»r jamb. I heard </p><p>a pleased exclamation from Hardridge as </p><p>the electric light came on within liis cell. </p><p>Thereafter he was silent, but, whether </p><p>because of my advice or because Miss </p><p>Maxon and I remained so close to the closet </p><p>that he could hear our occasional move- </p><p>ments, I do not know. </p><p> For by then it was quite dark, and. after</p><p>another little preparation for what was </p><p>to come, I joined Miss Maxon in the dining- </p><p>room. The partition between this room </p><p>and the reception-room split the inner wall </p><p>of the closet, and the house was so quiet </p><p>that we could sometimes hear Hardridge </p><p>breathe. We had turned on no lights save </p><p>that within the closet; so from without </p><p>the place no doubt appeared absolutely </p><p>deserted. </p><p> Everything was silent and dark. In the</p><p>two hours that wTe sat there, I found time </p><p>to go over several times every incident </p><p>connected with my peculiar visit to Crag- </p><p>castle. My interest—desultory at first but </p><p>rapidly quickening—in the Chronicle want </p><p>ad.; my carefully worded letter in answer </p><p>and Osborne's skilfully alluring and yet </p><p>noncommittal reply; our meeting—I sup- </p><p>pose I was one of some hundreds of appli- </p><p>cants. most of whom were disposed of by </p><p>the oflice boy; Osborne's quick inspection, </p><p>his clever cross-examination, his devious </p><p>approach to the subject of the missing heir. </p><p>Our agreement, and my arrival in mas- </p><p>querade at Cragcastle. My interview with </p><p>Hardridge, not wholly unexpected, yet a </p><p>very curious one, filled with much that </p><p>needed explanation. My startling discov- </p><p>ery of the presence of the girl, and her still </p><p>more startling revelations. The conception </p><p>and partial working out of my plan, the </p><p>Rogues’ End </p><p>67 </p><p>success of which hung on the next few </p><p>hours. </p><p> Throughout, I reflected, I had been for-</p><p>tunate; things had worked out very much </p><p>as I had planned and expected. My first </p><p>motive in the affair had been almost com-</p><p>pletely satisfied; only one question re- </p><p>mained unanswered—that of the cause of </p><p>Hardridge’s hatred of John Maxon. There </p><p>remained my awakened desire to serve </p><p>Miss Maxon, and in that I hoped that </p><p>Fate—it is my egotistic conceit to some- </p><p>times regard myself as Fate’s co-con- </p><p>spirator—would help me. </p><p> As for Miss Maxon, she would have been</p><p>either more or less than the very natural </p><p>woman she was had she not felt fear in </p><p>those hours. Indeed, she had no tangible </p><p>reason for placing confidence in me— </p><p>rather the reverse. It was largely because </p><p>of that fact that I had urged her to stay </p><p>in Cragcastle. Sometimes I thought it </p><p>was partly because of that fact that she </p><p>had stayed. Perhaps she wanted to be </p><p>on hand at the finding of the sapphire— </p><p>if it were found. Well, my wish corre- </p><p>sponded. If it were not found, I wanted </p><p>her to know it and be sure of it. </p><p> I had, in fact, a remarkably strong desire</p><p>to stand well in the estimation of Miss </p><p>Maxon. And I was meditating upon this </p><p>and also upon the problems connected </p><p>with the Ko Lao Hui when we both heard </p><p>quick, nervous steps coming up the gravel </p><p>path in front of the house. I whispered a </p><p>wholly unnecessary' warning to Miss Maxon </p><p>to keep quiet. Neither of us made a sound, </p><p>but both were on our feet when the key </p><p>of the newcomer grated in the lock of the </p><p>front door. </p><p>WHEN—after the front door had </p><p>opened and closed again—the hall </p><p>lights were switched on by some </p><p>one who seemed perfectly familiar with </p><p>their surroundings, I was standing just </p><p>within the dining-room door, with Miss </p><p>Maxon perhaps a pace behind me. As the </p><p>man for whom we had waited started down </p><p>the hall, I heard the slightest stirring in </p><p>the closet, which indicated that Hard- </p><p>ridge was also alert. </p><p> The visitor, however, passed the door</p><p>of the closet without pausing and came on </p><p>unhesitatingly down the hall. The parlor </p><p>and the reception-room he had already </p><p>passed; there remained but two possible </p><p>objectives, the library and the room wherein </p><p>Miss Maxon and I watched. That he </p><p>should turn into the latter had been a </p><p>chance I had been compelled to take; if </p><p>he did, the adventure would be apt to end </p><p>speedily and crudely. But great jewels, </p><p>I had reasoned, are not often concealed in </p><p>dining-rooms.</p><p> Yet, as the girl and I held our breaths,</p><p>he passed our door, too, without a glance </p><p>at the obscurity beyond it. </p><p> Though he could hardly have seen us</p><p>had he looked our way, he was fully re- </p><p>vealed by the hall light. The one look </p><p>I had of him was hardly reassuring for the </p><p>success of the game I had in mind. If we </p><p>had ever looked alike, then I owed it to my </p><p>self-respect to believe that Maxon had </p><p>changed greatly. But, indeed, I suppose </p><p>he had, for life stamps every face with </p><p>life’s own mark, and Maxon’s face had </p><p>become a danger signal of vice and coward- </p><p>ice. Now I was -very glad I hadn’t worn </p><p>my borrowed identity long. </p><p> There was now' only one door into which</p><p>Maxon could turn, and he entered the </p><p>library .across the hall without hesitation, </p><p>like one sure of his objective. I felt a </p><p>touch on my arm and looked around into </p><p>Miss Maxon’s eyes, very close. They </p><p>seemed to flash me at once a warning and </p><p>question, and I shook my head reas- </p><p>suringly. There wras no chance of Maxon’s </p><p>passing out except by the front door. To </p><p>a man of his temperament nothing could </p><p>be less attractive than the gloom and </p><p>desolation of the black rocks that flanked </p><p>the rear exit. </p><p> The sound of Maxon’s movements had</p><p>ceased. He had only been feeling for the </p><p>switch, for now', peering obliquely dowm </p><p>the hall, I saw the library lights flash on. </p><p>It seemed that he crossed the room; there </p><p>was another moment of silence and then </p><p>a sort of rending, scraping sound. </p><p> Which sound was, w'e afterward learned,</p><p>the spring-impelled opening of a small </p><p>door in the library wall and the tearing of </p><p>the wall-paper that had been put on over it. </p><p>Behind which door was a small vault, of </p><p>which I suppose only John Maxon, Sr., </p><p>had the knowledge and the key until he had </p><p>passed it on to his son. </p><p> Maxon had the sapphire—I knew so</p><p>much from his low exclamation of relief. </p><p>Hardridge must have heard it, too, for he </p><p>stirred uneasily in his prison room. Miss </p><p>68 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Maxon’s breathing quickened, while I— </p><p>Well, I held in ray hand almost literally </p><p>the key to the unexpected, and ray egotism </p><p>was pleasantly stirred. </p><p> Maxon came out of the library, now with</p><p>a quickened movement and on tiptoe. </p><p>He passed our door, bent over, fleeing.</p><p>We heard something. Was it a bolt that </p><p>had been drawn? John Maxon stopped </p><p>short. </p><p> A door was flung \iolentlv open. It was</p><p>the door behind which Hardridge, up to a </p><p>scanty thirty seconds before, had been </p><p>confined. And instantly I stepped out into </p><p>the hall behind Maxon. In fact, I stepped </p><p>out and Hardridge burst out at the same </p><p>minute. The effect was that we faced each </p><p>other in the well-lighted hall with Maxon </p><p>midway between us. </p><p> Hardridge looked—well, to exaggerate</p><p>but slightly, like a devil’s nightmare come </p><p>alive, crouching for the spring. For, of </p><p>course, he instantly thought of me, whom </p><p>he’d got into the habit of trying to kill. </p><p>But he saw Maxon in the hall instead </p><p>and then me over Maxon s shoulder, and </p><p>bewilderment flashed into his face and </p><p>matched his rage. The doubt I’d tried </p><p>to suggest to him, suddenly reinforced, </p><p>checked his rush. </p><p> I had intended, when I'd shaped mat ters</p><p>so far, to put that doubt fairly in the form </p><p>of a question, but John Maxon himself </p><p>made it unnecessary, had answered that </p><p>question before it was asked in a gesture </p><p>of self-betrayal He staggered back— </p><p>threw up his hands. </p><p> “Hardridge!” he croaked.</p><p> Something in his right hand left a streak</p><p>of light behind it, like a shooting star. </p><p> Aijd Hardridge, arriving at the truth too</p><p>quickly for memory or logic, recognizing </p><p>his enemy by a species of instinct, would </p><p>have leaped in dreadful silence at Maxon’s </p><p>throat. But I jerked my revolver up and </p><p>covered them both. </p><p> “One minute,” I said. “Well, Maxon.</p><p>Yes. I’m the man. Fra the man your tool, </p><p>Osborne, picked to take your place here. </p><p>Keep back, Hardridge. No, there’ll be no </p><p>killing here—not till 1 find out what it’s all </p><p>about, anyway. </p><p> “Speak up, Hardridge,” I ordered, turn-</p><p>ing from Maxon’s twitching features to </p><p>Hard ridge’s inflamed and deadly face. </p><p>“What have you against this man?'’ </p><p> “That, —— him!” exploded Hardridge.</p><p>“That traitor and thief! He stole the </p><p>money that would have saved me from </p><p>prison—me aud the rest of us. That </p><p>coward and cur! Why, blast you,” this </p><p>directly to Maxon, “you knew that without </p><p>that money we were lost. The—re- </p><p>formers-” </p><p> “He has a license to talk, he has,”</p><p>quavered Maxon, standing sidewise in die </p><p>hall, alternately glancing apprehensively </p><p>at Hardridge and beseechingly at me. </p><p> Unhappy, indeed, was his situation, his</p><p>only hope of life being in me, whom he’d </p><p>planned to dupe to the same death that now </p><p>threatened him. </p><p> “Who was he?" I asked Maxon. “Come</p><p>to the point, quick.” </p><p> “He! He was a dirtv gambling-house</p><p>keeper and dive-keeper and worse. King </p><p>of crookdom through his pull in the City </p><p>Hall. And the money he savs I stole was </p><p>a slush fund to keep the politician crooks </p><p>in office. Because the other side won and </p><p>he went to San Quentin where he belonged, </p><p>he blamed me-” </p><p> “You whining sneak,” cried Hardridge,</p><p>“you were thick enough with us while the </p><p>going was good.” </p><p> “That'll do, the pair of you,” I said. “I</p><p>quite understand.” </p><p> I did, well enough. Details were missing,</p><p>but they were unessential. These two </p><p>were part of the ring that had in the old </p><p>days debauched the city government of </p><p>San Francisco. To me that crime con- </p><p>stitutes one of the baser forms of treason, </p><p>and I admit my linger twitched to shoot </p><p>them both. </p><p> Then I thought of the sapphire. I’d</p><p>formed no definite plan as to acquiring it </p><p>once John Mason had taken it out of its </p><p>hiding-place. Circumstances must guide </p><p>me, and—here were the circumstances. </p><p>I SUPPOSE in a way I was re- </p><p>sponsible for what followed. I sup- </p><p>pose that my apparent indecision </p><p>encouraged Hardridge, and I may even </p><p>have stepped a little to one side. But I </p><p>know I didn't plan the thing or even </p><p>foresee it. I did have a peculiar flashing </p><p>vision of that dark canon at the rear of </p><p>the house, that dark canon with its smooth, </p><p>steep, narrowing sides and its floor dipping </p><p>ever more rapidly toward the jumping-off </p><p>place at the end. </p><p> Anyway, all of a sudden Hardridge</p><p>Rogues’ End </p><p>69 </p><p>started for Maxon. Maxon did the natural </p><p>thing for him; he whirled and ran. I could </p><p>hardly have stopped him if I had tried. </p><p>He brushed me back against Miss Maxon </p><p>and half-way through the dining-room </p><p>door, and Hardridge tore after him without </p><p>a word. </p><p> There was a chair near the end of the wall,</p><p>and Maxon had sanity enough left to push </p><p>it before him through the window. He </p><p>followed the chair head first, and Hardridge </p><p>plunged through the opening after him. </p><p> I was delayed a little in unlocking the</p><p>door. I stepped out into a fantastic hollow </p><p>of ragged rocks, flooded here at the ravine’s </p><p>beginning with moonlight. There was a </p><p>narrow’ pass to the right, but Maxon had </p><p>missed that pass. And he and Hardridge </p><p>were leaping like shadows straight down </p><p>toward Land’s End. </p><p> Maxon seemed to be straining to stop.</p><p>Perhaps he saw the railing and memory </p><p>came to him of what was beyond it. But </p><p>his pace was so great and the grade was </p><p>so steep that he could not check himself </p><p>all at once, and he brought up against the </p><p>railing with such force that it creaked and </p><p>sagged outward under the impact. But it </p><p>still held. </p><p> And Hardridge clutched him. But, by</p><p>the time I got close enough to see clearly, </p><p>Maxon had seized Hardridge’s wrists and </p><p>was prying them outward and slowly </p><p>loosing Hardridge's grip on his throat. </p><p>He wrenched Hardridge’s hands away, </p><p>and Hardridge gripped him around the </p><p>body. </p><p> But Maxon gripped him likewise and</p><p>began to bend Hardridge’s body backward. </p><p> “Oh, they’ll be killed. Can’t you—</p><p>Oh!” </p><p> Miss Maxon had come up, frightened,</p><p>sobbing. She would have run up to them </p><p>and thus put herself in danger, but I held </p><p>her back. </p><p> “My dear Miss Maxon! My 'dear Miss</p><p>Maxon!” </p><p> There was nothing else I could say.</p><p> I turned and saw how very like an open</p><p>door was the end of the canon. Beyond </p><p>that door the sky sparkled with stars, </p><p>and the waters beneath the stars reflected </p><p>their light. But the water at the base </p><p>of the cliff must have been too unquiet to </p><p>reflect it. I could hear it roaring as it </p><p>surged over the rocks, and I imagined it </p><p>stretching up white and hungry fingers. </p><p> “Can’t you stop them!” cried Miss</p><p>Maxon. </p><p> One more look I took at the place where</p><p>the two men had struggled. Then I </p><p>stepped between Miss Maxon and that </p><p>placfe and urged her gently back toward </p><p>CragcasUe. For Hardridge, knowing him- </p><p>self overmastered, had suddenly yielded </p><p>and somehow dragged Maxon with him</p><p>under the railing. Maxon gripped the edge </p><p>of the rock, but Hardridge tore his grip </p><p>relentlessly away. And so there came an </p><p>end to the bad beginning made many years </p><p>before. </p><p> I reflected, as I picked a w-ay up the</p><p>uneven canon bottom, that the quivering </p><p>woman whom I led would probably some </p><p>day be mistress of Cragcastle, since her </p><p>father was now heir to the Maxon fortune. </p><p>In that case they could well afford the loss </p><p>of the sapphire. </p><p>WE PARTED at the base of the </p><p>mountain, Miss Maxon and I. It </p><p>was not late, and we could go </p><p>different ways quite unnoticed into Mill </p><p>Valley and thence to San Francisco. If </p><p>the thing that had happened at Cragcastle </p><p>were ever discovered, there was no possi- </p><p>bility that she’d be connected with it, even </p><p>in thought. While as for me. . . . </p><p> “I’m sorry you’re going back to China,”</p><p>she said. N </p><p> Of course she would be, for I’d told her</p><p>absolutely nothing of my errand there, </p><p>unraveling the mystery of the Ko Lao Hui </p><p>leadership. If she had known w-hat was </p><p>ahead of me, she would have been </p><p>glad my eagerness to be at it was to be </p><p>gratified. </p><p> “You have been—well, fine,” she said.</p><p> I murmured a few deprecating phrases.</p><p> “And—wonderful. I've been trying to</p><p>guess—how much of it all you had planned </p><p>out ahead. The escape of Hardridge, for </p><p>instance.” </p><p> “Well?” I questioned noncommittedlv.</p><p> “You pretended it was accidental. But</p><p>I found the string with which you pulled </p><p>back the bolt of the closet door. That was </p><p>no accident.’1 </p><p> “Maybe not,” I replied.</p><p> Frankly, it pleased me a little that she</p><p>had discovered it. </p><p> “And then you knew—that father would</p><p>inherit-” </p><p> “Miss Maxon,” I said, “there’s no</p><p>70 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>pursuit so interesting as the pursuit of </p><p>motives, and none as profitless.’’ </p><p>She laughed a little. </p><p>“To think,” she remarked, “that, when </p><p>I think of you—as I shall quite often - 1 11 </p><p>always have to call you to myself just </p><p>‘that man.’ ” </p><p>1 suppose it had seemed to her a curious </p><p>omission; however, names are so far acci-</p><p>dents that they seem to count for but </p><p>little in the scheme of things. And I’ve </p><p>rather lost the habit of giving my true </p><p>name to every one I meet in passing </p><p>through this world as if I were some </p><p>article of merchandise that needed to </p><p>be perpetually tagged, ticketed and labeled. </p><p>But there is no reason why I should not </p><p>give it. </p><p> “My name Ls Partridge, John Partridge,”</p><p>I said as I released her hand. </p><p>CAPTAIN WILLIAMS, master of </p><p>the tramp Psyche, leaned upon </p><p>the rail of liis steamer’s bridge, </p><p>looking at a mellow “lovers’ </p><p>moon” and swearing with melancholy </p><p>ardor, while his chief officer, from the </p><p>other side of the bridge, regarded him </p><p>with a sort of disciplined disgust. </p><p> Surely it was bad enough to sail on an</p><p>old biscuit-box like the Psyche, without </p><p>having a skipper who allowed his private </p><p>troubles to influence him more than he </p><p>(lid the weather. And always after supper, </p><p>in the chief’s watch, when a man was </p><p>having enough to do to digest the mis- </p><p>called food that their miserly owner, Silas </p><p>Rutherford, picked up in some gutter, </p><p>did the old man come up on the bridge </p><p>and make things worse. The chief officer </p><p>snorted loudly. </p><p> As if it were an answer to the inter-</p><p>pretation of that snort, t he captain growled, </p><p>“You can go and take a smoke, if you want, </p><p>mister,” in such a way that any generosity </p><p>the permission might have contained was </p><p>wrung out of it like water from a swab. </p><p>If he had said, “Get to the devil out of </p><p>here, and leave me to my troubles,” the </p><p>chief officer would li^ve gone below with </p><p>the same “Thank you, sir,” and told the </p><p>same lurid tale to the second engineer in </p><p>the starboard alleyway—a tale which even </p><p>a Boccacio would find it necessary to </p><p>censor. - </p><p> But Williams would not have cared very</p><p>much if he had overheard. As a meed </p><p>of self-respect, he might have thrashed his </p><p>chief officer, but liis anger would have </p><p>been but superficial. For a far deeper </p><p>wound was stinging him, and the Psyche’s </p><p>nearness to her home port, Newcastle-on- </p><p>Tyne, was sending up the temperature of </p><p>the sore. </p><p> He began to stump up and down the</p><p>bridge, indifferent to a perfect Summer’s </p><p>evening. Tomorrow night and the Psyche </p><p>would lie in dock. Then would come the</p><p>usual two weeks of torturing desire, of his </p><p>praying to the girl to marry him and of her </p><p>answer, so galling to liis pride. </p><p> More money. Always more money.</p><p>Other men made more; why couldn’t he? </p><p>Touching the </p><p>Perils </p><p>Corn pi ate Novelette </p><p>BY S. B. H. TfURST </p><p>Touching the Perils </p><p>7i </p><p>And to his answer, that Silas Rutherford </p><p>would not raise his salary and always </p><p>managed to cheat him out of his bonus, </p><p>would come the irritating question— </p><p> “Why don’t you get another ship?”</p><p> As if ships were so easy to get. He</p><p>thought he had done very' well to get </p><p>command at twenty-seven, but the girl </p><p>was as blind to his merits as Silas was to </p><p>his need of more salary. And yet she kept </p><p>him hanging on, pretending to love him. </p><p>Not that the captain realized the pretense. </p><p>Being his ideal, liis divinity, she was be- </p><p>yond such a thing. And he loved her and </p><p>wanted her. Had the opportunity offered, </p><p>he felt that he would turn pirate to win her. </p><p>Then he cursed himself for not being his </p><p>own boss, for being dependent upon the </p><p>money of Silas Rutherford and his kind. </p><p> So, taking it altogether, he was an un-</p><p>pleasant commander, and, when he went </p><p>to his room shortly after eight bells, the </p><p>third mate, who had come on duty, breathed </p><p>more relievedly. </p><p> While the Psyche was pounding her way</p><p>to port, her owner was reading a document </p><p>that had to do with her insurance. As a </p><p>matter of fact, old Silas Rutherford could </p><p>recite the wording of that policy, but it </p><p>assisted his complex and criminal cogita- </p><p>tions to read and reread it while he planned. </p><p>The old phrase, handed down from genera- </p><p>tion to generation of marine underwriters, </p><p>brought to him visions of delightful possi- </p><p>bilities. “Now, touching upon the perils </p><p>—such as—” They wrere all there, from </p><p>“The act of God and the king’s enemies” </p><p>to all the chances of sea-disaster, and Silas </p><p>loved to dwell on them, hoping his ships </p><p>would fall foul of one or all of them, for </p><p>he greatly disliked paving premiums. </p><p> This was before the Great Killing put</p><p>the breath of life into old hulks, when </p><p>freights were so low that dead ships paid </p><p>better than live ones; when, because of this </p><p>latter fact, insurance policies were some- </p><p>times converted into cash by the unmoral.</p><p>xAnd Silas owned eight vessels that just </p><p>scraped into the A 1 classification by the </p><p>skin of their paint. </p><p> Not that he could be accused of lack of</p><p>effort in regard to striving for profit, even </p><p>when freights denied it—and Captain </p><p>Williams and the other captains and </p><p>officers in the ships of Silas were not the </p><p>only people aware of his scraping. His </p><p>name was a byword, and his stinginess </p><p>something to refer to as the acme of human </p><p>meanness. But Silas cared nothing about </p><p>that. </p><p> Indeed, he probably enjoyed his reputa-</p><p>tion and went on serving out paint with </p><p>the care of a chemist serving attar of roses, </p><p>while seeing to it that his crews, tired of </p><p>fighting for life against the board of trade </p><p>allowance—weighed out to them by partisan </p><p>scales and dredged from the dusty corners </p><p>of condemned ship-chandlers’ stores, de- </p><p>serted at the first port—with wages, of </p><p>course, unpaid. And Captain Williams and </p><p>the other captains and officers, as already </p><p>mentioned, slaved on low salaries for a </p><p>bonus which always mysteriously eluded </p><p>them. </p><p> But even such careful business methods</p><p>failed to produce a dividend. Which </p><p>caused Silas to take his insurance policies </p><p>out of the safe to yearn over them. </p><p> And the one he fondled most was the</p><p>policy that covered the ancient Psyche. </p><p>He had paid many premiums on that </p><p>promising piece of paper, all of them clear </p><p>gain to the insurance company, and by </p><p>exactly the amount of that premium had </p><p>the Psyche been a dead loss to him for more </p><p>than a year. Surely the coincidence was </p><p>meant as a hint. A deacon of his church </p><p>for more than forty years. . . . </p><p> He sat in his lonely, dingy office, the</p><p>warm breeze of the Summer evening bring- </p><p>ing through the window the noise of </p><p>rattling winches on ships loading and dis- </p><p>charging in the near-by docks. He usually </p><p>sat there until bedtime, because he had no </p><p>friends and because to spend money on </p><p>amusement was an impossible vice to a man </p><p>who would rather have the money than </p><p>the amusement. And he wasn’t worth </p><p>more than a million pounds, exclusive of </p><p>his exasperating investment in ships. </p><p> So for many evenings had he deliberated</p><p>over an untimely end for the Psyche. </p><p>Neither did the idea leave him altogether </p><p>during the day. But the one large obstacle </p><p>in the scheme was the need of an accom-</p><p>plice. He would have to find a man </p><p>willing to undertake the sinking or burning </p><p>of the ship, and that man would have to </p><p>be well-paid. Of course, the captain was </p><p>the best man for the job. But, then, the </p><p>captain would not only have more at stake </p><p>than an ordinary man, but he would also </p><p>be more expensive. </p><p> He would be risking his certificate in</p><p>72 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>addition to taking the chance of going </p><p>to prison, and he would know the value </p><p>of the insurance policy. Yet Silas clung </p><p>to the notion of getting the captain to help </p><p>him. If he could only “get around” Wil- </p><p>liams in some way. There must be a way, </p><p>for every man has his weak side, or else </p><p>there is something he wants so badly that </p><p>he will do anything to get it. </p><p>SO HE reasoned. Yet, when the </p><p>weakness of Captain Williams came </p><p>into the office next morning, Silas </p><p>nearly missed his opportunity. </p><p> She came early, her good looks and pre-</p><p>tended embarrassment signaling for help— </p><p>which three clerks immediately attempted </p><p>to give her. But Silas prevented them. </p><p>That is, he happened to come into the office </p><p>at that moment, and the clerks scurried </p><p>back to their desks as he brushed past the </p><p>girl on the way to his roofti—leaving her </p><p>standing in the middle of Lhe floor, appealing </p><p>to the universe with a studied pose. The </p><p>clerks peered over their desks at her, re- </p><p>markably like three scared mice peering </p><p>out of their holes at a tempting piece of </p><p>cheese which the proximity of the cat </p><p>prevented them from appropriating, until </p><p>with a shrug she turned and walked boldly </p><p>into the private office, astonishing Silas </p><p>by asking sweedy when the Psyche would </p><p>be in port. </p><p> “How did you get in here?" he barked.</p><p> The girl pouted and indicated the door</p><p>with a gesture. </p><p> “Well, what do you want?”</p><p> “When will the Psyche come in?”</p><p> “What do you want to know for?”</p><p> “Because—because Captain Williams is—</p><p>is a friend of mine.” </p><p> A remarkable change came over Silas.</p><p>He became almost polite, closing the door </p><p>and dragging a chair to the desk for the </p><p>lady. </p><p> “Sit down, won’t you? So you’re a friend</p><p>of the captain’s, ch. Very lucky man!” </p><p>And he giggled in the senile way of men</p><p>unaccustomed to women. </p><p> “Yes—we—we—you see-”</p><p> She blushed with the acquired art of long</p><p>practise. </p><p> “I do see—you are going to marrv him,</p><p>eh?” </p><p> “Perhaps,” she stiffened slightly.</p><p> “Ump ”</p><p> Silas was thinking hard, but the girl,</p><p>believing him at the limit of his conver- </p><p>sational powers, decided, for reasons of. </p><p>her own, to help him. </p><p> "It s the way I’ve been brought up,”</p><p>she hinted. She had been “brought up” </p><p>in the unpleasant environment of a cheap </p><p>saloon—a “tied house,” owned by a brew- </p><p>ery—of which her father had been the </p><p>ostensible proprietor. “I’ve had so many </p><p>good offers that the wages of a ship-captain </p><p>look kind of small. But, oh my, what am </p><p>I saying—you must think i’m oreful, </p><p>talking to a stranger this way.” </p><p> •'Not at all. my dear.” Silas found him-</p><p>self thinking he needed a new’ suit. </p><p> “So,” she further elucidated, “I am</p><p>making him waiL till he gets better off.” </p><p>Greater luck can no man have than that </p><p>a woman will hare her fool soul to him, </p><p>but the somewhat fascinated Silas missed </p><p>the revelation, seeing only a pretty girl </p><p>whose power over the captain of the Psyche </p><p>could be used advantageously. </p><p>“You w’on't tell him I was here.” she </p><p>rattled on. “He's so jealous, you know.” </p><p>She wondered wiiat it would be like to be </p><p>married to a man w'orth a million pounds, </p><p>even if he w*ere old. </p><p> “No, I won’t tell him you were here.”</p><p>Silas held her unresisting hand. He had </p><p>never known a woman like her, which was </p><p>perhaps unfortunate, because there was </p><p>no memory' she could revive to bring back </p><p>the taste of rotten fruit—which most men </p><p>have lipped and remember only with </p><p>feelings of the deepest shame. He was </p><p>sorry when she left, and she had shown </p><p>him that Williams could be handled. </p><p>Later on he recollected that he had not </p><p>answered her question about the docking </p><p>of the Psyche. She was too good for </p><p>Williams, anyhow! </p><p> But the captain w*as an honest man,</p><p>and Silas was nervous about broaching the </p><p>subject. He waited until the Psyche had </p><p>been in port two days. Then, in the </p><p>middle of business details, he suddenly </p><p>remarked— </p><p> “Hear you’re going to get married?”</p><p> The captain flushed but said nothing.</p><p>“Girl want to wait till there’s more money </p><p>in the bank?” suggested Silas crudely. </p><p> “Something like that.” admitted Wil-</p><p>liams gruffly, his face showing how the </p><p>w’oman had fascinated him, how he craved </p><p>her. </p><p> “Well—” Silas seemed to sneer—“if I</p><p>Touching the Perils </p><p>73 </p><p>wanted a girl and was a big, strong, young </p><p>fellow like you, I’d do more than sit </p><p>around—I’d rob a bank before I’d let her </p><p>get away from me.” </p><p> “That would only get me in jail,” re-</p><p>torted Williams. </p><p> Silas laughed to hide his nervousness—</p><p>“Would you do it if you knew you </p><p>wouldn’t get caught?” </p><p>“I’d do anything,” growled the captain. </p><p>“But what’s the good of talking about it?” </p><p>“Well,” Silas hesitated, then took the </p><p>plunge, “well, I can show you a way to </p><p>make money.” </p><p> Williams was first astonished; then he</p><p>was effusively grateful— </p><p> “If you do that, Mr. Rutherford, I’ll</p><p>give my life for you any time.” </p><p> “Don't want you to do that.” Silas</p><p>got up, walked to the door,' opened it sud- </p><p>denly, saw that no one was listening and </p><p>went back to his desk. “Don’t want you </p><p>to do that,” he cackled at the surprized </p><p>captain. </p><p> He stopped talking—it was a difficult</p><p>job, this, even harder than he had expected. </p><p>He wondered how Williams would face the </p><p>Board of Trade investigation after the thing </p><p>was done. Lawyers have a way of making </p><p>sailors tell more than they want. He had </p><p>seen ’em. </p><p> “The fact is,” he managed after a few</p><p>minutes, “the fact is, Captain, the Psyche </p><p>has been a dead loss to me for some time.” </p><p>“I’ve done my best, sir.” </p><p> “Yes, yes, I know you have. But all</p><p>the same, you know, I can not be expected </p><p>to keep on taking losses. I’m not in busi- </p><p>ness for the fun of it any more than you </p><p>are. But, while you get your pay every </p><p>voyage, whether the ship makes a profit </p><p>or not, I don’t.” </p><p> “You aren’t thinking of laying her up,</p><p>are you, sir?'’ The captain was naturally </p><p>distressed at such a possibility. </p><p> “May have to,” Silas sighed, “unless</p><p>you can help me out.” </p><p> “Me, sir? What would you suggest, sir?</p><p>I	can not see where I can cut down expenses</p><p>anywhere.” </p><p> Silas appeared to think deeply. Then</p><p>he went to the safe and brought back the </p><p>insurance policy. </p><p> “I suppose that, like every other captain</p><p>afloat, you’ve often thought about the </p><p>insurance, haven’t you?” </p><p> “Yes, and with the way things are I’ve</p><p>often felt like I’d like to make a profit for </p><p>you that way, sir,” was the astounding </p><p>answer. </p><p> “Do you mean it?” Silas almost shouted.</p><p>“Why, no, of course not. I was just </p><p>joking,” replied the somewhat shame- </p><p>faced Williams. “You know, just as you </p><p>said, nearly every skipper thinks about the </p><p>insurance now and then—and wonders.” </p><p>“Well,” Silas spoke very' quietly now, </p><p>“I am not joking—not a bit of it. Things </p><p>have come to the place where I don't joke </p><p>about insurance. See here, help me to </p><p>realize on this, and I’ll give you command </p><p>of my best ship with increase of pay and </p><p>five hundred pounds as well.” </p><p> He had said it. He had taken the leap,</p><p>and now he watched the captain—who for </p><p>the moment was speechless—with some </p><p>apprehension. </p><p> “What do you mean?” growled the cap-</p><p>tain. “Want me to turn crook?” </p><p> “You know what you just said?”</p><p> “Yes, but that was in fun.”</p><p>“IS IT fun about your wanting to </p><p>get married, too?” Silas grinned— </p><p>the captain had given him far less </p><p>trouble than he had expected. “If you </p><p>won’t sink the Psyche for me, I’ll get a man </p><p>who will, fire you and give you no reference. </p><p>Where would your marriage be then?” </p><p>Where would it? The unhappy sailor </p><p>could easily answer that question. And </p><p>there was hardly a chance of being found </p><p>out. Wasn’t she worth taking that chance </p><p>for. </p><p> “Suppose I tell the insurance com-</p><p>pany what you asked me to do?” he spoke </p><p>desperately. </p><p> “I'll have you arrested for criminal libel</p><p>and send you to prison. You have no </p><p>witness, you know. But why be foolish? </p><p>Only you and me will know—and its my </p><p>ship, anyway. I'll be hanged if I can </p><p>understand why you even hesitate—and </p><p>a fine young lady like that waiting for you, </p><p>too. And the money all’s between you.” </p><p>Williams said nothing. Every cell in his </p><p>great body craved the girl, and. when in</p><p>such a condition, a man’s morals are </p><p>smothered by very primitive emotions. </p><p>And, as he had said, most sailors look upon </p><p>insurance from the owners’ standpoint. </p><p> “Just think,” urged Silas, “you’re char-</p><p>tered to a Spanish port. Easy cargo to </p><p>fire. Open the sea-cocks to drown it. </p><p>74 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>She'll sink in no time. You’ll be back </p><p>in a few weeks, and then—your wedding- </p><p>day." </p><p> But th£ captain still fought feebly.</p><p> “What about my ticket?"</p><p> “They won’t touch it. How can they?</p><p>’Taint your fault if the cargo catches lire. </p><p>The crew will only be too eager to get clear. </p><p>You’ll probably be a hero for not losing </p><p>a man. You know just where to start </p><p>things. And afterward you’ll get my best </p><p>ship, you know. And, yes, I’ll let you take </p><p>your wife to sea with you. Chances are </p><p>that, if you don't take this offer and get </p><p>some money, she’ll marry some other man. </p><p>And you know it.” </p><p> Williaras did know it. And he remem-</p><p>bered vividly an unpleasant scene of the </p><p>previous evening when the lady had taunted </p><p>him about his lack of ability t6 make </p><p>money. She wanted a diamond ring, </p><p>which his scant savings made impossible. </p><p>And here was five hundred pounds going </p><p>begging. The job was easy enough. And </p><p>in six weeks, at the most, he could be </p><p>married, get a better ship with more pay </p><p>and take her to sea with him. That last </p><p>pulled hardest. </p><p> '‘What are the terms?” he asked gruffly,</p><p>not looking at Silas. </p><p> “Fifty pounds dowm and the balance</p><p>when the job’s done. Your pay increased </p><p>two pounds a month from today. And, </p><p>of course, no lay-off when the Psyche sinks.” </p><p>Still the captain hesitated. He loved </p><p>ships and felt not unlike a prospective </p><p>murderer. Indeed, this sentiment weighed </p><p>more on the moral side than did the chance </p><p>of being found out. But, then, Silas, old </p><p>scoundrel, would get another man to do it </p><p>unless he did it. And the girl. . . . </p><p>Williams got out of the chair. </p><p> “I’ll let you know tomorrow,” he prom-</p><p>ised and went to see the lady.* </p><p> He saw her. What chance had his</p><p>scruples in her presence, that had been </p><p>weak enough in the office of Silas Ruther- </p><p>ford. For sailors are really myopic about </p><p>the rights of insurance companies. Then,</p><p>their last parting still in his mind, he </p><p>greeted her with— </p><p> “How would you like a fifty-pound</p><p>diamond ring?” </p><p> “You darling. How did you do it?”</p><p> “I didn’t say I’d got it. I just asked</p><p>you how you’d like one." </p><p> She moved away from him:</p><p> “You know I want one. Do you think</p><p>it clever to talk that way. It’s bad enough </p><p>to think of marrying a man too poor to </p><p>buy a girl what every other engaged girl </p><p>has, without him making a joke about it. </p><p>You’d be ashamed if you had any.” And </p><p>a cloudburst settled the matter. </p><p> A little later, after he had promised</p><p>to buy the ring next day, she again asked </p><p>where he raised the money. He told her </p><p>of his raise of pay, the best ship, permission </p><p>to take his wife—did she know who that </p><p>lady was—and invented a savings-account </p><p>of long duration to account for the ring. </p><p>But, if a man must sell his soul, why not </p><p>for kisses? For has any philosopher yet </p><p>proven them to be w’orth less than pieces </p><p>of silver? </p><p>II </p><p> SO A few wreeks later Captain</p><p>Williams wralked down the&gt; rocky, </p><p>dog-smelly street of a tiny Spanish </p><p>fishing village, the stars looking at him from </p><p>a windy sky and his mouth gritty with </p><p>curses. It was after midnight, and, but </p><p>for spasmodic barkings and the moan of </p><p>the flood tide, the place was quiet and </p><p>sleep-suggesting. But Williams could not </p><p>sleep. Indeed, he doubted if he would </p><p>ever sleep again, for his thoughts were a </p><p>roaring cyclone that would not still. So </p><p>he had left his bed in the smugglers' retreat </p><p>of an inn and gone dowm to the shore. </p><p> And everything had looked so bright.</p><p>Things had gone just as he had planned. </p><p>The Psyche had caught fire in six places </p><p>and shortly afterward slipped to the bottom </p><p>of the sea without making much fuss. </p><p>Ten hours in the boats—Williams had been </p><p>favored with a nice fair wind—and all </p><p>hands had been safely landed. Then, the </p><p>news cabled to Silas, the captain had waited </p><p>for orders and congratulations wrhile he </p><p>arranged for the crew to be sent home </p><p>by the distressed seaman’s route. </p><p> By rights he should have gone with them,</p><p>but his conscience had gathered to itself </p><p>all manner of intangible fears, and he had </p><p>decided to wrait in the village. Then Silas </p><p>had replied to the cable—by letter, to save</p><p>money. And with the letter from Silas </p><p>had come another. </p><p> The old man had been abusive. Why</p><p>had the captain been so careless as to lose </p><p>a valuable ship and cargo? This w'as to be </p><p>Touching the Perils </p><p>75 </p><p>expected, and Williams had grinned at </p><p>what he imagined to be cunning and, </p><p>while grinning, did not trouble to finish </p><p>the letter. Instead, he opened the other, </p><p>which he was itching to read. </p><p> And the other letter had opened his eyes,</p><p>broken his heart, as he believed, and shown </p><p>him that Silas had meant what he had </p><p>written. For Silas had married the girl, </p><p>who wrote saying she could never marry </p><p>a man who lost his ship, who would never </p><p>get another ship, and who hadn’t a penny </p><p>to his name. But she forgot to send the </p><p>ring. That was all, except that she loved </p><p>Mr. Rutherford. </p><p> There was no word from Silas about the</p><p>four hundred and fifty pounds he had prom- </p><p>ised to pay and nothing about the command </p><p>of his best steamer. No; just the curt </p><p>letter of abuse and the reminder that </p><p>Williams would get no reference from him. </p><p>And the illuminating scrawl from the </p><p>woman. No wonder Wrilliams could not </p><p>sleep. But he would get even. Oh, yes, </p><p>he would show them. But how? To </p><p>write to the insurance company would be </p><p>foolish. </p><p> Silas would have him arrested for libel—</p><p>the libel of a disappointed suitor—and the </p><p>company would arrest him for barratry. </p><p>And what chance would his word have </p><p>against that of Silas? Silas, with a million </p><p>pounds to hire lawyers, and W7illiams </p><p>without—the girl had spoken at least </p><p>one true w-ord—a penny. He even owed </p><p>the keepeF of the cheap inn. </p><p> But Williams saw nothing strange about</p><p>the wedding. The woman’s cleverness </p><p>escaped him. He was so infatuated with </p><p>her that it never occurred to him that </p><p>Silas was an old fool who had fallen as </p><p>he himself had fallen. For Williams still </p><p>believed that any man would marry her </p><p>if she were willing, and he thought Silas </p><p>lucky. To have thought otherwise would </p><p>have done away with the urge for revenge. </p><p>That was all that mattered now—to get </p><p>even. </p><p> But when a few nights later the dirty</p><p>keeper of the inn shut the door in his face </p><p>about bedtime, shrieking shrill abuse which</p><p>had to do with the payment of debt, and </p><p>Williams had no place to go but the beach— </p><p>the desire tor revenge had grown colder. </p><p>Immediate need had fogged its clarity, </p><p>and kisses were of less wrorth than square </p><p>meals and warm beds. But there were </p><p>neither beds, meals nor kisses in sight. </p><p>Yet, its shadow beckoning across the calm, </p><p>moonlit sea, was a small fishing-boat at </p><p>anchor and untenanted. </p><p> So, shivering slightly, the captain</p><p>stripped, bundled his clothes on his head </p><p>and, swimming high, made his way to her. </p><p>Climbing on board, he dressed, wrapped </p><p>himself in the sail and after a time slept. </p><p>No doubt the graybeards of that village </p><p>will tell for many years the legend about </p><p>the thief of an Englishman who, not </p><p>content with robbing the keeper of the inn, </p><p>stole also a fishing-boat. But, like most </p><p>legends, the tale will lack truth. For </p><p>Williams did not steal the boat. On the </p><p>contrary, the boat stole the captain. </p><p> That is, while he slept, it tugged uneasily</p><p>at its anchor until the grass rope doing </p><p>duty as a cable parted, and Williams, still </p><p>sleeping, was carried out to sea on the ebb </p><p>tide. He awoke with the call to breakfast. </p><p>But the call was but the echo of other </p><p>meals, for there wasn’t a crust on board. </p><p>And the land was a mere haze, and no </p><p>ships were in sight. </p><p> The tale of thirst and hunger has been</p><p>too often told to be here repeated. Be- </p><p>sides, there is nothing pleasing about the </p><p>tale. More pleasing to Williams is the </p><p>fact that three days later he reached </p><p>Gibraltar in the dark, was mistaken for </p><p>a denizen of the place and met a shrewd </p><p>Rock scorpion who had no ears for tales </p><p>but who gave him five pounds for the boat, </p><p>which, of course, was worth much more. </p><p>But five pounds to the captain was the </p><p>beginning of fortune. Once more he could </p><p>eat, sleep and smoke. And revenge still </p><p>called him, but its voice was not so near. </p><p> It was obviously his duty, both to him-</p><p>self and the underwriters, to go back to </p><p>England for the Board of Trade investiga- </p><p>tion. Silas had been right when he had </p><p>said the captain’s certificate would not be </p><p>blackened, but a guilty conscience saw </p><p>less clearly. As it was, he might find an </p><p>out-of-the-way owner who would not ask </p><p>questions—for the ticket and his previous </p><p>discharges were in his possession. </p><p> But Gib. was no place to find such owners,</p><p>although it w'as an excellent place to get</p><p>word of them. The five pounds melted </p><p>rapidly, and W illiams had no desire to see </p><p>another door shut in his face about bed- </p><p>time when friendly fish-boats might not </p><p>beckon so kindly. And, once broke, he </p><p>76 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>would be harried into some ship's fore- </p><p>castle without chance of holding back. </p><p>So one sunlit morning he went in search </p><p>of the Rock scorpion and found him easily. </p><p> ‘‘Howdy?" the scorpion was affable.</p><p> Williams replied in kind and began to</p><p>collect the memories having to do with </p><p>scorpions. He had heard about their </p><p>many underground methods of doing busi- </p><p>ness and their supposed vast wealth. The </p><p>rumors that they formed a sort of trust, </p><p>which had a finger in all Gibraltar business, </p><p>had also come his way. He knew that, </p><p>while willing to buy a fishing-boat and </p><p>in league with the many smugglers in the </p><p>district, it was no uncommon event to see </p><p>a scorpion bid for a steamer at auction </p><p>and pay fifty or sixty thousand pounds </p><p>cash when it was knocked down to him. </p><p> But whether the scorpions worked as a</p><p>league or as individuals was no concern </p><p>of Williams’, because this shabby, some- </p><p>what unclean, English-language-mangling </p><p>mixture of a hundred different breeds was </p><p>obviously not only his star of hope but </p><p>also his last resort—excepting, of course, </p><p>some ship’s forecastle, under a new name. </p><p> “Like to talk business with you.”</p><p>Williams succeeded in making his voice </p><p>sound comfortably indifferent, although back </p><p>in liis mind the final episode of the kid- </p><p>naping fish-boat loomed largely. </p><p> “Oh, ha, of course—we go to my horfice.”</p><p>THEY walked along the warm, </p><p>dusty, winding road until they </p><p>arrived at a sort of wine-shop, with </p><p>the customary sign relating to the purity </p><p>and antiquity of the goods sold within </p><p>and the usual heavy population of flies. </p><p>Near the door a young Spaniard made </p><p>querulous demand of a starved donkey, </p><p>emphasizing his wishes with a stick. But </p><p>the animal continued to study the sign </p><p>of the wine-shop as if he sought patiently </p><p>for some degree of truth, and blow's could </p><p>not penetrate to his absorbed mind. They </p><p>passed inside, where the apparent owner </p><p>slept comfortably, quite indifferent to his </p><p>likeness to a fly-paper—waking into a </p><p>million smiles when the scorpion kicked </p><p>him.</p><p> “This my home and horfice,” the scorpion</p><p>made some unnecessary remark. “Into </p><p>the back room this son of ten thousand </p><p>thieves will bring us drink, where we may </p><p>talk in peace, eh?” </p><p> The gentleman of the penitentiary family</p><p>increased the ratio of his smiling at the </p><p>reference to his ancestors, produced two </p><p>not overly clean glasses and a bottle and </p><p>led the way into the back room—a dingy </p><p>place, which, however, was gratefully cool </p><p>after the street. </p><p> “What the business you have?”</p><p> The preliminaries were over, and the</p><p>scorpion made inquiry. </p><p> Captain Williams hesitated. In the hard,</p><p>curious eyes of the scorpion he saw the </p><p>answer to any request for a job, the answer </p><p>to any asking for assistance—a sneering </p><p>“nothing for you”—and a sickening feeling </p><p>of failure was succeeded by a gust, of anger </p><p>at himself for ha\ing stooped so low. And </p><p>then suddenly he felt himself in the </p><p>unusual position of being, as it were, </p><p>behind those eyes—of looking at himself </p><p>through the eyes of another man. And </p><p>what he saw' made him ashamed. </p><p> Then he realized that all men who have</p><p>the courage to sail their own ships—the </p><p>men w'ho do not depend on “jobs”—must </p><p>regard him as the scorpion would do the </p><p>moment he mentioned the “business”— </p><p>as a sort of weakling, as a failure, as one </p><p>of the sort that wants things arranged for </p><p>him, much as a mule needs harnessing </p><p>before it can work. Yes, he saw himseS </p><p>as one lacking that something which causes </p><p>a man to struggle towrard an ideal, heedless </p><p>of the mire he must go through—to inde- </p><p>pendence. </p><p> And then he asked himself why? Why</p><p>should he not be his own boss when this </p><p>wretched Rock scorpion could be? Surely </p><p>he had as much intelligence. The other </p><p>was not even a white man—was a mongrel </p><p>of a hundred mixtures. Yet he had made </p><p>something of himself. Better a burglar </p><p>than a beggar. Williams saw himself, </p><p>almost cringing to this mongrel for a job, </p><p>doing the rotten bidding of old Silas, a </p><p>slave to his lust for a woman—even this, </p><p>in his moment of clarity, did he see. And </p><p>—for such things do actually happen— </p><p>in that moment Williams became something. </p><p> Just as a chemical solution remains a</p><p>mere grouping of molecules until the </p><p>addition of the needed constituent causes </p><p>precipitation, so had Williams lived in</p><p>the inchoate condition of the majority of </p><p>mankind—until this moment in the grimy </p><p>wine-shop. What really happened he never </p><p>knew or troubled to know. He felt his </p><p>Touching the Perils </p><p>77 </p><p>mouth and chin stiffen to the latent power </p><p>in him that had found its motive, and his </p><p>eyes, now grimly smiling, fought down </p><p>very easily those of the scorpion. </p><p> Still, there was no business that he knew</p><p>of, but in his new condition such an ad- </p><p>mittance was unthinkable. Therefore he </p><p>fenced. And luck was with his first </p><p>passage with the swords of business, with </p><p>his lirst job as his own boss. </p><p> “How many ships do you want?” he</p><p>asked carelessly, rapidly deciding that, </p><p>if the scorpion had bought ships once, he </p><p>might buy them again and, if nothing </p><p>came of his question, he had saved his face </p><p>by the pretense of having something for </p><p>sale. To his astonishment the scorpion </p><p>seemed startled, most upset. So many </p><p>words rushed for outlet that they jammed </p><p>in his throat like a panic-stricken crowd </p><p>trying to escape from a burning building. </p><p>And this agitation grew rapidly. </p><p> “Who told you? What you mean, eh?</p><p>Have you just pretend? You come in </p><p>fish-boat; look like you broke. Not fair, </p><p>that. Oh, ha, no, not at all fair. I think </p><p>you all the time were fooling. Yes, I told </p><p>my wife that. You ask her. She say so, </p><p>too. Now, what the game, eh?” </p><p> Williams laughed and continued to</p><p>laugh to give himself time to think. Why </p><p>should the scorpion be so excited? Even </p><p>supposing that he had some deal on that </p><p>had to do with the buying of ships—why </p><p>on earth should the mere mention of it </p><p>throw him into such a state of mingled </p><p>fear and anger? Things were so bad all </p><p>over the world that only an unprecedented </p><p>buying could send prices up—nothing </p><p>that the scorpion could be connected with. </p><p>Yet, what was he afraid of? </p><p> “Well,” Williams spoke quietly, delight-</p><p>ing in the new feeling of power, “I had my </p><p>reasons for coming to Gib. in that old boat </p><p>and for selling her to you at far below </p><p>her proper price. Mavbe I hadn’t been </p><p>quite so far out to sea as I looked.” He </p><p>paused, wondering what the owner of the </p><p>boat had thought, meaning to pay him </p><p>some day. “But you don’t expect me to </p><p>tell you all that, do you?” </p><p> The scorpion rapped loudly on the table,</p><p>cursed the lazy innkeeper when he appeared, </p><p>and gave great orders about setting up-the </p><p>very best wine in the house in a hurry. </p><p>He had a notion that hospitality greases </p><p>the ways. </p><p> “We are friends, no?” he professed.</p><p> “If you like to put it that way—I’m not</p><p>particular,” Wrilliams crushed down the </p><p>weakening memory of what he had 'been </p><p>an hour ago. </p><p> The wine arrived*, and Williams was</p><p>amused at the ceremonious manner of the </p><p>scorpion. It reminded him of something. </p><p>Whom had he seen drink that way? </p><p> But the wine did not loosen the tongue</p><p>of the scorpion, although Williams ques- </p><p>tioned him quite cleverly. Consequently, </p><p>the captain was driven to invention. He </p><p>had a fair knowledge of financial methods, </p><p>even if most of it had been acquired in the </p><p>bucket-shops that had prevented his savings </p><p>from rising to diamond rings. And he </p><p>understood something of the wrays of ship- </p><p>brokers. That reference to ships seemed </p><p>to be trumps. At any rate, it was the </p><p>only card in his hand. He decided to </p><p>play it. </p><p> “Now, look here, Sylvester,” he began</p><p>to lie fluently, “what I have been doing </p><p>is all my business. I took that boat just </p><p>as I always take what I happen to want, </p><p>but what caused me to take her is also </p><p>my business. Now, the two men who </p><p>I have had watching you-” </p><p> Sylvester jumped out of his chair, his</p><p>eyes popping. For why had the captain </p><p>had him watched? Had they not always </p><p>been the best of friends. If the captain </p><p>wanted more for the fish-boat, he had </p><p>only to say so, and the money would be </p><p>given him at once. He knew they wrere </p><p>friends. They had drunk much" wine </p><p>together. He had always loved the captain </p><p>and had heard of the great deeds of that </p><p>wonderful man, the captain’s father, before </p><p>him. For why had he been w*atched as if </p><p>he wrere a thief? </p><p> With an effort Williams put an end</p><p>to this unexpected but very satisfactory </p><p>outburst. It was obvious that Sylvester </p><p>was interested in ships, queer though it </p><p>seemed. And he knew the methods of </p><p>scorpions pretty well. If this one were </p><p>buying ships—and he appeared to be— </p><p>he would buy them on options. For, </p><p>whether he w’ere buying for himself or for </p><p>some Asiatic who w-anted to become an </p><p>owner—which often happened—or buying</p><p>on speculation—whatever reason, he would </p><p>first buy an option on the vessel or vessels </p><p>he wanted. </p><p> This deduction was so simple that to</p><p>78 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>spring it on Sylvester would surprize him </p><p>no more than it would suqjrize a stock- </p><p>gambler to tell him you knew he was buying </p><p>on margin. But, if Williams could get </p><p>the scorpion to believe he knew why he </p><p>was buying or whom he was buying for— </p><p>why, in that case, he might do business. </p><p>Because people who wanted to buy ships </p><p>in anything but a very small way were at </p><p>that time rare. </p><p> “Of course, I wanted to know about you,</p><p>and I paid to lind out,” he growled. “How </p><p>do you think 1 made my money—by selling </p><p>boats? So I made up my mind to see you, </p><p>because there wras money in it. Because, </p><p>of course, 1 found out you are trying to </p><p>tie up a bunch of steamers on options.” </p><p>I*! AGAIN Sylvester rapidly worked </p><p>feiita his hands and tongue, but his </p><p>denial was weak. What would he </p><p>throw away money like that for—ships </p><p>not worth anything? Did the captain </p><p>think him a fool to buy options when ships </p><p>were not paying the owners enough to buy </p><p>paint? He went on hastily to explain </p><p>that he knew this because he sold paint, </p><p>and he went off at a tangent, gabbling </p><p>about the paint business until Williams </p><p>shut him up again, grinning. </p><p> He filled one of the glasses to the brim</p><p>and drank to the staring scorpion. </p><p> “Now—” he put down the empty glass,</p><p>“I know you’re after options, but you’re </p><p>not getting them as fast as you want </p><p>because you have to go awful quiet about </p><p>it. I, too, have bought options. Now, </p><p>it doesn’t matter who will take them up— </p><p>you know, and I know. The difference is </p><p>that you are buying the options directly </p><p>for the final buyers of the steamers, w'hile </p><p>I am buying on spec, with my own money. </p><p>If I didn’t know that your people will be </p><p>glad to take my options off my hands at a </p><p>profit to me, you don’t think I’d have been </p><p>fool enough to buy them, with times as </p><p>they are, do you?” </p><p> The fascinated Sylvester shook his head</p><p>in agreement. </p><p> “So 1 know who you’re working for,</p><p>and I know they want a lot of ships. 1 </p><p>have between twenty and thirty Ai </p><p>steamers tied up that I will turn over to</p><p>your people, and I have another fleet of </p><p>seven right under my hand.” He was </p><p>thinking of Silas and his unfortunate in- </p><p>vestment in shipping. “Now, don’t ask </p><p>me questions, because you won’t get any- </p><p>thing out of me. Tell the chap who is </p><p>behind you that he can come to my hotel </p><p>tomorrow morning if he wants to do busi- </p><p>ness at the right price. That’s all.” </p><p> He shot a glance at the scorpion and saw</p><p>that his surmise had been correct. There </p><p>was some man behind Sylvester, and that </p><p>man was in Gibraltar. So far, so good. </p><p>And he had learned that often the most </p><p>shrewd men are the most credulous, </p><p>especially when their suspicions can be </p><p>aroused. </p><p> “When can you deliver?” Sylvester,</p><p>admitting everything, spoke like one deeply </p><p>grieved. </p><p> “Whenever I want to. Charters and</p><p>ship can be transferred together, if neces- </p><p>sary, but most of them are only chartered </p><p>from voyage to voyage. Not a one of </p><p>them is tied up for more than a month. </p><p>But, of course, I have to give, in most cases, </p><p>a certain number of days’ notice.” For </p><p>a moment Williams was afraid his limited </p><p>knowledge had caused liim to make a slip, </p><p>but the scorpion appeared quite satisfied; </p><p>so he went on. “But don't imagine </p><p>that I tied up forty or fifty thousand </p><p>pounds for the fun of it. Use your brain, </p><p>Sylvester. Why did I come to you in that </p><p>dirty fish-boat?” </p><p> That w'as a clever move, for the scorpion’s</p><p>mind loved the curved route, and the </p><p>action of his backer depended greatly upon </p><p>Sylvester’s opinion of Williams. The cap- </p><p>tain did not know it, but the scorpion, </p><p>seeing profits for himself without much </p><p>labor, had already decided to tell his man </p><p>that he had known Williams for thirty </p><p>years, knew him to be worth at least a </p><p>hundred and fifty thousand pounds— </p><p>there are many men of millions not known </p><p>to Bradstreet—knew his word to be as </p><p>good as a bond and knew all about his </p><p>good old English family before him. </p><p> Later, when the way looked very smooth,</p><p>Williams was to realize this character- </p><p>painting of the scorpion, and now his </p><p>lucky words helped the selection of the </p><p>brightest colors. For Sylvester’s mind </p><p>loved the crooked lane, the while he be- </p><p>lieved it to be straight. The dim, the </p><p>dark, the mysterious appealed to him w’hen </p><p>square buying and spiling wouldn’t rouse</p><p>him to interest. Yes, and he believed </p><p>every word Williams had told him, al- </p><p>though he would have called a straight </p><p>Touching the Perils </p><p>79 </p><p>tale a lie. He thought over all he knew </p><p>of the captain. </p><p> The night he had slipped into Gib.,</p><p>dodging the customs and all, liis worn- </p><p>out state hinting at anything; his laughing </p><p>when he had asked the scorpion if he cared </p><p>to buy “so small a ship”—Sylvester had </p><p>not remarked the significance of the phrase </p><p>at the time, but now it gripped him with </p><p>the pinch of a million suggestions—his tak- </p><p>ing the money without counting it; his </p><p>lazing around ever since until his mys- </p><p>terious coming that morning. And this </p><p>wras what it meant. It would be w-ell to </p><p>keep on the right side of this man. A man </p><p>of parts—and clever. How had he found </p><p>out who wanted those options? </p><p> Sylvester did not know this himself.</p><p>He only knew Smith, the agent for the </p><p>capitalists. But he would never let Wil- </p><p>liams know that he knew so little. Later </p><p>on, when the captain had made much </p><p>money because of what Sylvester told </p><p>Smith—then, good friends, he would make </p><p>the captain very drunk—oh, he knew </p><p>the way—and he would find out. But just </p><p>now was no time to take any chances with </p><p>a promising friendship. Not that it mat- </p><p>tered who was putting up the money. </p><p> “And we are good friends, no?” he</p><p>repeated as Williams swung his bulk out </p><p>of the shop. </p><p> “Not a bit particular—would do business</p><p>with a jackal. Tell your man tomorrow </p><p>morning, if he wants to see me. Very </p><p>busy. Expect to go to London in a day </p><p>or two—back right away. Keep your eyes </p><p>open for anything good not in the shipping </p><p>line, and let me know. May help you to </p><p>make a shilling or two.” </p><p> He threw one of his few remaining</p><p>shillings at the dirty innkeeper, conscious </p><p>that Sylvester would force him to divide, </p><p>and left the place to which he had come as a </p><p>suppliant—as a man. </p><p>Ill </p><p>WILLIAMS awoke early from a </p><p>dream in which old Silas Rutherford </p><p>had begged for a penny, and with </p><p>Silas, needing bread, had been the woman </p><p>and a long line of small Rutherfords. He </p><p>got out of bed feeling like an expectant </p><p>child on Christmas morning. And wrhat</p><p>did the stocking hold for him? He shaved, </p><p>remembering the previous day and the </p><p>days before that with an angry shame. </p><p>But he would never be a crawler again. </p><p>He thrilled to the joy of rebirth. What a </p><p>pile of lies he had told Sylvester. Who the </p><p>devil wras behind the scorpion, anyhow? </p><p>Yet he was proud of those lies. How much </p><p>would he make out of this chance if he </p><p>handled it right? Might get enough out </p><p>of it to make up for the four hundred and </p><p>fifty. </p><p> Then he made a large breakfast, lit a</p><p>cigar and went out to the veranda. The </p><p>man behind the scorpion would come to </p><p>him, all right. And he did come, which </p><p>further stimulated the intuitive faith Wil- </p><p>liams had in himself. He was half-way </p><p>through the cigar when a boy brought </p><p>him a card bearing the name “J. P. Smith,” </p><p>with no address or prefix. </p><p> And Smith himself was just as indefinite</p><p>in appearance. An Englishman, appar- </p><p>ently, with no trace of an accent to indicate </p><p>his county. He was dressed neatly but </p><p>simply, clean-shaven and about the same </p><p>age as Williams. </p><p> “Know ships well, eh?” he remarked as</p><p>they sat down in a quiet corner. </p><p> “Yes,” Williams studied him; “went to</p><p>sea for a w'hile, until I came into my money. </p><p>And you?” </p><p> “Never wrent to sea, but I served some</p><p>time in an engineering shop. Got this scar </p><p>there—a furnace-tender hit me with a hot </p><p>slice-bar.” </p><p> He turned his head so that Williams</p><p>could see a scar across liis left cheek, about </p><p>three inches in length. </p><p> “I savvy,” Williams grinned. “Had a</p><p>few scraps myself, but they mostly left me </p><p>alone on account of my size.” </p><p> This exhausted their introductory sub-</p><p>stance. For a few minutes neither spoke; </p><p>then Smith said thoughtfully: </p><p> “Sylvester gave me a great account of</p><p>you, and, as he dare not fool me, I believe </p><p>him and am willing to do business with you. </p><p>He says you have already bought some </p><p>options on ships, which seems to prove what </p><p>he also says—that you know who the </p><p>people are behind this thing. Do you?” </p><p>Williams looked at the other, their eyes </p><p>met and held. The captain spoke quietly: </p><p>‘‘I have the options, winch, as you say, </p><p>seems to prove that I do know. But don’t </p><p>you think it better—for me—to act as if </p><p>I did not know who is really going to get</p><p>the ships? I know I’d like it better if I </p><p>8o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>thought I was only selling to Mr. Smith. </p><p>If we have to speak of—of those others— </p><p>suppose we call them ‘the firm?” </p><p> Smith laughed softly and dropped his eyes.</p><p> "So,” he murmured, “that’s it. Well,</p><p>I don't blame you, and I feel safe you won’t </p><p>talk. Now suppose I put my cards on the </p><p>table. We have only just begun to buy </p><p>options, and I was given the job of getting </p><p>them because I am not a shipping man </p><p>and would not be suspected. I had to </p><p>come to Gibraltar on another matter, and, </p><p>having heard about these scorpions and </p><p>their ability to get ships cheap, I tied up </p><p>this Sylvester—telling him nothing. So </p><p>far we have done but little, but soon </p><p>I will go to London and get busy, with </p><p>more men to help me. But 1 have to have </p><p>your options, of course, and, of course, </p><p>you want to sell—bought them for that </p><p>reason.	*</p><p> “Suppose you transfer all you have</p><p>over to me and go out and get all you can </p><p>in addition—I will agree to take all you </p><p>can get. But, first, can you guarantee </p><p>to a transfer from your option-forms to </p><p>these—which are perhaps more generous?” </p><p> He handed Williams a printed option-</p><p>form, which the captain read rapidly. As </p><p>he had Thought no options, he naturally </p><p>had no objection to saying he could use </p><p>the forms. </p><p> “I will buy,” Smith was saying, “at ten</p><p>shillings a ton for six months from date of </p><p>transfer to me. You can make your com- </p><p>mission and profit from the difference </p><p>between the ten shillings and what you </p><p>have to pay, can you not?” </p><p> Williams thought rapidly. His numerous</p><p>conversations with other shipmasters had </p><p>given him much inside information about </p><p>the losses of many firms of ship-owners, </p><p>apart from what was general knowledge. </p><p>He had no doubt that many were anxious </p><p>to sell and would welcome the chance to </p><p>get a few shillings a ton for options. He </p><p>knew, too, that his credit and reputation </p><p>stood very high with Smith—Sylvester’s </p><p>extraordinary agitation had seen to that. </p><p>By the way, why had Sylvester been so </p><p>upset? He questioned Smith. </p><p> “Oh,” Smith’s face hardened with a</p><p>curious expression, “oh, he was just scared </p><p>you were going to cut in on him; that’s all.” </p><p> He became silent, as if with the suspicion</p><p>that Sylvester knew more than he was </p><p>supposed to. </p><p> “How much will you agree to deliver?”</p><p>Smith seemed anxious to keep to business </p><p>and get the matter settled. </p><p> YVilliams breathed deeply. This was</p><p>his first plunge. </p><p> “Oh, I can promise a hundred thousand</p><p>tons if you will agree to take all I can get </p><p>over that at ten shillings a ton. Purchase </p><p>price to be not more than an advance of a </p><p>fourth of insured value.” </p><p> “Will you sign a binding contract to that</p><p>effect, agreeing to pay me ten shillings a ton </p><p>damages for all of the hundred thousand </p><p>you fail to deliver?” </p><p> “Got a copy of that contract?”</p><p> From among his many printed forms</p><p>Smith produced a blank contract, pointing </p><p>out the various clauses. It was a clear </p><p>and concise form. </p><p> “You will have thirty days in which to</p><p>deliver a hundred thousand tons to me, </p><p>each option to run for six months from the </p><p>date it is signed. Is all that satisfactory?” </p><p>“Seems so,” Williams spoke slowly. </p><p>“I am to contract to deliver to you options </p><p>for six months on a hundred thousand </p><p>tons of Ai steamers, no ship to be less than </p><p>twentv-five-hundred tons, net, at ten shil- </p><p>lings a ton to me. The options to be </p><p>drawTi on your forms, which you supply. </p><p>If I fail to deliver, I am to pay you ten </p><p>shillings a ton for all I lack of the hundred </p><p>thousand. You also agree to buy, on the </p><p>same terms, all over the hundred thousand </p><p>that I can get hold of?” </p><p> “That last may be canceled at any time,</p><p>though, wlien we get all w'e want,” supple- </p><p>mented Smith. </p><p> “Sure—you’re not buying all the earth.</p><p>I know that. Of course, you know that </p><p>I already have most of that hundred </p><p>thousand. The options are with my lawyer </p><p>in London; so all I have to do is transfer </p><p>them from my forms to yours. I got them </p><p>for longer than six months; so that’s easy. </p><p>And the final buyer in all cases, at no more </p><p>than a fourth in excess of insured value, </p><p>is to be J. P. Smith, not the firm, eh?" </p><p> “Don’t talk like that,” snapped Smith.</p><p>“You’re not supposed to know about the </p><p>firm, vou know." </p><p> “All right, Mr. Smith/; Williams re-</p><p>torted, “but I do know this: that, while </p><p>the firm has lots of money, you may not </p><p>have. I have only your word, you knowr, </p><p>that you represent them. If you want me</p><p>to sign this contract—it means a lot to me, </p><p>Touching the Perils </p><p>81 </p><p>and I’m financially responsible, you know— </p><p>you must show me you do represent the </p><p>firm. That is, you must show me the </p><p>color of your money." </p><p> Which was rather a neat speech for a</p><p>man with less than a shilling in the world </p><p>and with a hotel bill of about seven pounds. </p><p>But Smith was all smiles. </p><p> “My dear fellow, 1 didn’t mean to be</p><p>offensive. Of course you shall have the </p><p>money. I meant cash, anyhow. I know </p><p>all about you, and I want those options. </p><p>Come over to the bank and sign the con- </p><p>tract. If the fifty is not enough, you can </p><p>have all the cash you need. Sylvester told </p><p>me that you had tied up most of your loose </p><p>capital—quite a lot in those options, of </p><p>course.” </p><p> “Oh, fifty will do,” Williams spoke</p><p>vaguely, having decided to let Smith run </p><p>things at this stage, because his own knowl- </p><p>edge of finance was hardly sufficient to let </p><p>him lead. </p><p> At the bank the contract was signed in</p><p>duplicate and duly witnessed. Then Smith </p><p>handed Williams a check, and the husky </p><p>sailor came nearer to fainting than ever </p><p>before during his twenty-seven years. For </p><p>Williams had expected fifty pounds as a </p><p>sort of binder, and the check was for fifty </p><p>thousand. </p><p> Through a sort of fog he heard Smith:</p><p> “You will deliver the options to my bank</p><p>in London as fast as you get them. Here </p><p>is the address. I will be in London myself </p><p>shortly, as I said. Good luck to you, </p><p>because I don’t want damages but options.” </p><p> “You’ll get them, all right,” mumbled</p><p>Williams, marveling at his first experience </p><p>of the wonders of good credit. </p><p> Yet it was all simple enough. Smith</p><p>believed that Williams already had some </p><p>options and could get more, and he wanted </p><p>them. Sylvester—and Sylvester dared not </p><p>fool Smith—had rated Williams as first- </p><p>class credit. What more natural than </p><p>Smith should imagine it good business to tie </p><p>Williams to a contract and pay cash? </p><p>Williams was safe, and, if he failed to </p><p>deliver, it simply meant the return of the </p><p>unused money. </p><p> Besides, Mr. Smith knew a lot of things</p><p>that he knew Williams could not know, </p><p>even if he were willing to believe the </p><p>captain knew who the final buyer would be.</p><p>He knew, for instance, that Williams could </p><p>not know why the firm was buying ships. </p><p>Which reason Smith knew warranted his </p><p>taking chances with much larger sums than </p><p>he had given to the supposedly responsible </p><p>Williams. </p><p> Yet, the firm, doing business in a large</p><p>way, load, of course, its owti corps of private </p><p>detectives and kept a line on every man </p><p>with whom it did business. Williams never </p><p>knew that the charming American girl who </p><p>made his voyage to London so pleasant </p><p>and who put Mrs. Silas entirely out of his </p><p>mind was Mrs. Smith minus her wredding- </p><p>ring—who had been set to keep track of his </p><p>doings until the last option had been de- </p><p>livered. </p><p>IV </p><p>THE Yellow' Star Navigation Com- </p><p>pany was in bad shape, and the fact </p><p>of its not being alone in its trouble </p><p>did not compensate it for its difficulties. </p><p>Freights were so low that the twenty </p><p>freighters sailing with the yellow' star on </p><p>their funnels might as wrell have traveled </p><p>in ballast for any profit they made. And </p><p>the Pilling Brothers, sole owners, who had </p><p>inherited the business from their father, </p><p>saw only ruin ahead unless they could sell. </p><p>But who would buy, with the books showing </p><p>a loss for many months and practically </p><p>every ship-owner in the United Kingdom </p><p>with ships listed in the brokers’ offices? </p><p> This being their mental and financial</p><p>attitude, it was no wonder they almost </p><p>doubted the cessation of miracles when </p><p>Captain Williams—looking tremendous and </p><p>prosperous in his new, shiny top-hat and </p><p>frock coat—walked into their office, smiled </p><p>pleasantly and told them he wanted to </p><p>purchase a few steamers. Could they </p><p>oblige him by selling? </p><p> They, of course, hadn’t thought of doing</p><p>such a thing. They owned twrenty of the </p><p>sweetest tramps on the seas, and there was </p><p>a sentimental value about every keel, </p><p>because their dead father had laid the </p><p>foundations of the business. Besides, they </p><p>hadn’t an idle vessel. </p><p> Captain Williams was very sorry, but</p><p>he intimated that he was willing to buy a </p><p>six-months option on the twenty vessels, </p><p>at five shillings a ton. The purchase price </p><p>to be one-sixth in advance of the insured </p><p>value. </p><p> The Pilling Brothers, gasping like men</p><p>learning to swim in cold w&gt;ater, managed </p><p>to ask for a few minutes alone so that they</p><p>82 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>could consider the offer. Williams pulled </p><p>out a new watch, mentioned that he was </p><p>very busy, that opiious could be picked </p><p>up, he believed, at even better terms, and </p><p>said he would wait live minutes. </p><p> Now, the total tonnage of the Yellow</p><p>Star Line amounted to eighty thousand </p><p>tons. Consequently, Williams had offered </p><p>the Fillings twenty thousand pounds lor </p><p>the privilege of buying the twenty ships </p><p>any time during the next six months. </p><p>ll‘ he did not buy, the twenty thousand </p><p>would be a clear gain to the Fillings; if </p><p>he bought, it meant that they could sell </p><p>out at about what the ships had cost them. </p><p>It was all very satisfactory if the man were </p><p>sane and responsible. For, with shipping </p><p>conditions what they were, what on earth, </p><p>or rather water, did a man want to buy </p><p>options for? </p><p> The form was liberal, too. Thirty days</p><p>notice, charters to be taken over if they </p><p>were not fulfilled, but no charter for longer </p><p>than usual voyage to be signed during </p><p>option, and steamers to be delivered at a </p><p>port to be later designated. Ten days in </p><p>that port for inspection, during which </p><p>demurrage would be paid by prospective </p><p>buyer. Option money not to count toward </p><p>purchase price. Yes, it was very satis- </p><p>factory, if the man were responsible. If </p><p>he were, well, it was his money, and he </p><p>could spend it on wine, women, song or </p><p>ships—and the least wise investment of the </p><p>four would be ships. </p><p> The Pillings looked back on many a</p><p>headache that lacked the pleasant memories </p><p>of either song, sips or kisses but only reeked </p><p>with columns of figures, crowding like dis- </p><p>tracted humans to the left side of the </p><p>ledger. Yes, they would sell the options. </p><p>The terms alter calling wrere very liberal, </p><p>and the purchase price was satisfactory. </p><p>They never tried to bargain. They were </p><p>too anxious, too much afraid the large </p><p>angel might go elsewhere for his options. </p><p> The buyer was J. P. Smith. So, and</p><p>Mr. Williams was his agent. Well and </p><p>good. So, with details which may be </p><p>omitted, the deal was closed, and Williams </p><p>delivered eighty thousand tons of ship- </p><p>options to Smith's bank, clearing for himself </p><p>the decent profit of twenty thousand </p><p>pounds. There was still in his possession </p><p>ten thousand pounds cf Smith’s check, </p><p>which he intended to put to the credit of</p><p>Silas Rutherford. </p><p> This notion amused him. Since his re-</p><p>birth he had so expanded that he felt too </p><p>big for any petty revenge. Of course, </p><p>he wouldn’t mind doing tome tiling big, </p><p>thus making the woman sorry she had </p><p>turned him down. Hut nothing petty. </p><p>Besides, he wanted to earn some more </p><p>money, and he felt sure that Silas would </p><p>sell. Thus he thought, very contented, </p><p>a^ the train whirled him north to the city </p><p>of Silas Rutherford, looking forward to </p><p>the interview. The old man would cer- </p><p>tainly be startled. </p><p> But the black town, enveloped him with</p><p>a certain degree of nervousness as its grimy, </p><p>outlying suburbs began to throw their </p><p>tentacle-like streets about the railroad </p><p>track, slowing the train. He had to light </p><p>down the heart-beats roused by the asso- </p><p>ciation of ideas, forcing himself to look </p><p>upon bis love for the woman as if it were a </p><p>disgusting disease, stripping her of the halo </p><p>with which he had once endowed her, </p><p>seeing her as “a rag and a bone and a hank </p><p>of hair” —and not too clean hair or rags </p><p>at that. And finally, when the train </p><p>reached the station, he achieved calm. </p><p> There was satisfaction about signing his</p><p>name in the register of the best hotel, with </p><p>his tall liat somewhat on the back of his </p><p>head. Then, wisely, he took a cab to the </p><p>office of a first-class lawyer, told him about </p><p>the loss of the Psyche, omitting no details </p><p>and leaving a handsome retainer against </p><p>the possible Board of Trade investigation, </p><p>which, however, would be unlikely to drag </p><p>in anything about liis crime. But it seemed </p><p>best to play safe. He could put up good </p><p>bail, if the wrorst happened, and leave Silas </p><p>to hold the bag as he deserved. For Silas </p><p>was not in the happy position of having </p><p>all his assets comfortably stowed in his </p><p>breast pocket and could never make a </p><p>run for it, because he was anchored to </p><p>his investments by the steel cable of miser- </p><p>liness </p><p> Worse, the poor old fool was stranded</p><p>on the shoals of matrimony, unable to run </p><p>for the open sea and safety, with a woman </p><p>scraping at a hole in his ribs with every' lift </p><p>and settle he made to the tide of life. </p><p>Williams, reveling in his metaphofs, began </p><p>to realize the benefits of freedom and to </p><p>feel that what he had taken for the shackles </p><p>of love was mere tissue-paper disguised in </p><p>tinfoil. He devoured an excellent dinner </p><p>and walked happily through the smoky</p><p>Touching the Perils </p><p>83 </p><p>early dark of September, puffing no longer </p><p>at a pipe but at a two-shilling cigar. </p><p> It was after office hours, but Williams</p><p>had waited purposely, knowing the ways </p><p>of Silas and wanting to meet him when </p><p>alone. Of course, there was the chance </p><p>of his staying home, now that he was </p><p>married. But the captain thought other- </p><p>wise, remembering cynically that the wed- </p><p>ding had occurred some weeks before. </p><p> And he was right. True, for a few days</p><p>the old man had lingered by his fireside—at </p><p>home, rather, for Silas allowed no heat </p><p>in his house before late October—but he </p><p>had soon pleaded the call of business and </p><p>gone back to his old habit of sitting in his </p><p>lonely office, bemoaning liis unlucky invest- </p><p>ment in ships. And his wife had made no </p><p>objection. She had pretended, of course, </p><p>but had secretly rejoiced when he left her. </p><p>And Williams, stepping quietly, found the </p><p>outer door open and went in. </p><p> He paused to think for a moment on the</p><p>number of times he had entered that office </p><p>full of a craven fear that he might lose his </p><p>job. Then he squared hi? shoulders and </p><p>went forward, still so quiet that Silas did </p><p>not hear him but saw him framed in the </p><p>doorway of the private office when he </p><p>happened to look up. And for a moment </p><p>the old man imagined he was looking at a </p><p>ghost. </p><p> Then the captain shut the door, sat down</p><p>by the desk and lit another cigar, but he did </p><p>not remove his shiny hat. </p><p> “Didn’t expect to see me, did you, you old</p><p>thief?” he began pleasantly. </p><p> Silas made no reply. Williams was cer-</p><p>tainly not a ghost, but he was decidedly </p><p>an apparition—what with the frock coat, </p><p>the tall hat, the jewelry, the cigar and, </p><p>above all, the assured manner. He was so </p><p>unlike the old Williams that he was only </p><p>just recognizable as that person. And the </p><p>first coherent thought of Silas was the wish </p><p>that Williams had always been as he then </p><p>was—in which case the woman would have </p><p>never thrown him down. </p><p> “I don’t need that dirty four hundred</p><p>and fifty—I’m a rich man now—but I’m </p><p>going to make you sorry for what you did.” </p><p> “I am sorry, Williams, very sorry.” And</p><p>so full of truth was the old voice that the </p><p>captain believed him. </p><p> “You mean it?”</p><p> “Yes, I mean it. But not about the</p><p>money. You wouldn’t believe me if I said </p><p>I was sorry about the moneys and I don't </p><p>blame you. But I’ll give you a check for </p><p>that right away, Williams. I wish I could </p><p>give you back all I robbed you of so easily.” </p><p>He looked so old, seemed so tired, so </p><p>utterly disappointed with life, that Wil- </p><p>liams, who had come in anger, became </p><p>sympathetic. He watched the veined, </p><p>trembling hand writing the check and </p><p>coughed to hide an unexpected swell of </p><p>emotion. </p><p> “Yes, Williams—” the old man handed</p><p>the captain the check—“maybe I was </p><p>alone too long; maybe I was never meant </p><p>for a married man, and maybe I got the </p><p>wrong sort of a woman. But, just as I sit </p><p>here, she sits at home-1-! want my ships to </p><p>sink; she wants me to die. And I must </p><p>leave her my money. It don’t seem right </p><p>not to, does it?” </p><p> There is a clannishness about sex. Wil-</p><p>liams had gone to Silas with anything but </p><p>friendly feelings, but now he found himself </p><p>taking sides with him—against the woman. </p><p> “If I was you, I’d give her fifty thousand</p><p>and tell her to get a divorce. Get drunk, </p><p>tell her to have witnesses and take a </p><p>strange woman home with you some night. </p><p>She’d jump at the chance to cry in court. </p><p>It’s the best wray out of it—infidelity and </p><p>cruelty, you know.” </p><p> “But,” wailed Silas, “I’m a deacon of my</p><p>church—have been for forty-odd years.” </p><p>“It’s the devil how a man’s youthful </p><p>follies dog liis life, isn’t it?” answered </p><p>Williams gravely. “But I wouldn’t let </p><p>that stop me. You can easily square the </p><p>church with a fat check and a public con- </p><p>fession of sin. Weep a bit and beg ’em </p><p>to take you back into the fold. They'’11 </p><p>like you all the better for it. It’s a cinch.” </p><p>The old man brightened; then he became </p><p>unhappy. </p><p> “But think of the expense, W'illiams;</p><p>think of the expense,” he groaned. “With </p><p>shipping the way it is.” </p><p> “Why, as to that, I can help you,”</p><p>W’illiams exclaimed as if the idea had just </p><p>come to him. “I have come into a tidy </p><p>bit of money, you see. Not got it all </p><p>through the courts yet, but got a good bit </p><p>of it. I’ve always wanted to be a ship- </p><p>owner—all skippers do—and I wouldn’t </p><p>wonder if things looked up soon. As I said, </p><p>I	can not get hold of all my money just nowr,</p><p>but I'll pay you five shillings a ton for an </p><p>option to purchase your seven ships, at</p><p>84 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>their insured value. Option to run for six </p><p>months.” </p><p> “Sav that all over again,” the old man</p><p>nearly screamed. </p><p> WILLIAMS repealed his statement,</p><p>and the old man began to think, to </p><p>look for a trap. This looked too good </p><p>to be true, but, then, Williams always was </p><p>a fool, and, if he wanted to tie up his inheri- </p><p>tance in ships, that was his lookout. There </p><p>was no way Sikte could be cheated if he </p><p>watched out. </p><p> “Looks to me like a temporary drop,</p><p>that’s all,” he said oihly. “It wouldn't sur- </p><p>prize me a bit to see freights take a big jump </p><p>pretty soon. Who left you the money?” </p><p> “None of your bally business,” snarled</p><p>Williams. “And you can’t fool me about </p><p>freights going up. Me and my partner </p><p>want seven steamers. If you won’t sell </p><p>at the price I mentioned—the option is </p><p>because my money may be six months </p><p>before getting through the court—I can </p><p>easily get some one who will. Now, what </p><p>are you going to do?” </p><p> “Price is till right if the form is.” Silas</p><p>spoke hastily. </p><p> It would never do to let this golden oppor-</p><p>tunity get aw'ay from him. </p><p> Williams gave him one of Smith’s printed</p><p>forms, and the old man read and rereau it </p><p>carefully. </p><p> “Tliat’s all right and regular. You</p><p>must be buying from more than me to go </p><p>to the expense of getting these special forms </p><p>printed. But I ought to get more than the </p><p>insured value.” </p><p> Y’ou can either take what I offered or</p><p>keep your ships,” Williams retorted, deter- </p><p>mined to keep Silas down to the price, </p><p>although the agreement with Smith per- </p><p>mitted him a fairly wide margin above it. </p><p> And finally Silas agreed, very inquisitive</p><p>about the Smith party and the source of the </p><p>inheritance—a curiosity Williams did not </p><p>satisfy. </p><p> And finally the captain left the city</p><p>without troubling to see the woman he </p><p>had once adored and unaware that she </p><p>had waited for him every day after her </p><p>husband had told her about his wonderful </p><p>change in condition and circumstance. </p><p>He left without being troubled by the Board </p><p>of Trade, feeling sorry for Silas. Asa matter </p><p>of fact, he was doing too wrell to hate any- </p><p>body, for a telegram from Smith in Loudon</p><p>liad invited him to dinner and to bring </p><p>all the options with him he might have </p><p>succeeded in buying. </p><p> And Smith was radiant. Admitting that</p><p>everything was going splendidly, he paid </p><p>Williams for his options and promised to </p><p>pay for any more he could get. The con- </p><p>tract, which had been carried out, was </p><p>returned. Then they dined in a place </p><p>which Williams had only heard about. </p><p>But in his new dress-suit he acted as if </p><p>he had eaten in such places ever since he </p><p>began on solid food. And the wine flowed </p><p>very freely. </p><p> “I can get you more options yet,” prom-</p><p>ised Williams. </p><p> “Excellent, my dear friend, excellent.</p><p>Do you want die money now or when you </p><p>deliver?” </p><p> “Lord,” Williams grinned expansively,</p><p>some curious intuition making him pretend </p><p>that the wine had affected liim more than </p><p>it really had. “Lord. I can trust you. We </p><p>are all in die same boat, aren't we?” </p><p> Smith smiled as one knowing himself to</p><p>be sober smiles at one he imagines to be </p><p>drunk. </p><p> “Yes,” he murmured, “all in the same</p><p>boat, my dear Williams, but we didn't </p><p>all get into the boat the same way, did </p><p>we?” </p><p> W’illiams laughed fatuously. Then, his</p><p>voice rather hoarse: </p><p> “No, w*e did not. You know how I got</p><p>in. How did you—pier-head jump or first- </p><p>class passenger?” </p><p> It was hardly a polite question, not a</p><p>politely worded quesrion. but Smith merely </p><p>looked at the bottle and smiled again. </p><p>“As if you didn't know?'' he suggested. </p><p>“Oh,” Williams felt very much as when </p><p>he first talked to the scorpion—as if he </p><p>were trying to find his way in the dark. </p><p>“Oh, I suppose you were bom that way?” </p><p> 11	w'as a silly remark, but Smith glanced</p><p>at him keenly— </p><p> “Think so?’’ he asked shortly.</p><p> “Know it. just as I know that I wasn’t.”</p><p>“You’re a clever man." Smith com- </p><p>plimented. “Far more so than even I at </p><p>first believed.” He spoke thoughtfully. </p><p>“But we are the best of friends and can </p><p>trust one anodier. Tell me, how did you </p><p>find out that Sylvester was buying options— </p><p>Gib’s a queer place, in a way, for that. </p><p>And how did you discover who is to be die </p><p>final buyer—who are the firm, eh?" </p><p>Touching the Perils</p><p>85 </p><p> Williams fumbled with the tip of a cigar,</p><p>then clumsily bit it, again laughing foolishly. </p><p> “You know, Smith/' he went on with the</p><p>portentous gravity of the intoxicated, </p><p>“I'm a good Englishman, but I ain’t a fool </p><p>about it. There's lots of people don’t </p><p>like to see an English ship sold to foreigners. </p><p>But I don’t care if the red ensign is changed </p><p>to the Hottentot flag, if I can make money </p><p>out of it. Did you say the Czar of Russia </p><p>was president of the firm? Would you say </p><p>that?” </p><p> “No, I wouldn’t, but I will say you’re</p><p>drunk,” Smith spoke impatiently. “What’s </p><p>the use of all this fencing about the thing. </p><p>As you'll find when you try to buy, we have </p><p>picked up about all the options we want. </p><p>You know as well as I do that American </p><p>capital is behind this buying. Of course, </p><p>we had to keep it quiet and don’t intend </p><p>to talk now, but it was kind of annoying </p><p>for you and me to pretend there was a mys- </p><p>tery about it. You knew from the first </p><p>meeting that I was an American, just as </p><p>you know that America has been sorry </p><p>she hadn’t a merchant fleet. </p><p> “Where you got the hint I do not know,</p><p>but you knew America lacked building </p><p>facilities and that it would be cheaper to </p><p>buy from the British, especially with </p><p>shipping on the blink, as it has been. </p><p>Besides, it would have taken too long to </p><p>have built our own fleet. And watch </p><p>freights go up when we call our options. </p><p>But it’s a bit of a joke on your country, eh? </p><p>Won’t the lion roar? Better become an </p><p>American citizen, old man.” </p><p> Williams’ head sank forward as if he were</p><p>falling asleep, and Smith raised his hand to </p><p>shake him into wakefulness, muttering— </p><p>“Wonder if he only guessed—knowing </p><p>that America was the only place with </p><p>enough private capital to swing such a </p><p>deal?” </p><p>, V </p><p>SO THAT was it. What a blind </p><p>bat he had been not to see through </p><p>the scheme, Williams, still pretend- </p><p>ing drunkenness, thought as Smith saw him </p><p>to his room. But it was all right. If </p><p>Americans wanted to buy what the" British </p><p>wanted to sell, whose business was it? Of </p><p>course, there would be a howi from the </p><p>press. But why couldn’t the British ship- </p><p>owners have thought of a gigantic combine </p><p>which would have given them powrer to </p><p>make their own freight rates as the American</p><p>buyers intended to do? Well, let them </p><p>howl. They needed waking up in England. </p><p> Smith, leaving London the next day</p><p>for some place he did not mention, called </p><p>to say good-by and to remind Williams </p><p>of his promise to say nothing about the </p><p>big deal until it was consummated. And, </p><p>when Williams promised readily enough, </p><p>Smith rewarded him with the advice that </p><p>he would be wrasting his lime to look for </p><p>more options. There might be one or two </p><p>ships not tied up wrhich the owners were </p><p>willing to sell, but he doubted it. And </p><p>Williams found he was right. Liverpool, </p><p>London, Belfast—every shipping town in </p><p>the kingdom was visited by the captain. </p><p>But not a single option could he purchase. </p><p> “Whew, some deal,” he muttered as the</p><p>size of the thing dawned upon him. “Well, </p><p>I can’t kick. It helped me.” </p><p> And he decided to visit the town of his</p><p>birth and indulge in a gentle spree. </p><p> But the spree did not stop at the gentle</p><p>stage. It developed into the most involved </p><p>experience of its kind in the captain’s </p><p>eventful life. Famous among his brother </p><p>officers for his capacity, he was now finan- </p><p>cially able to do himself proud. So, when </p><p>he had hajd enough of it, what with the time </p><p>consumed running about England looking </p><p>for options and the time taken up by that </p><p>remarkable dissipation, some months had </p><p>passed since his farewell with Smith. And </p><p>events had occurred w’hich the captain, </p><p>never a reading man, had not heard about. </p><p>For whenev er a boon companion had at- </p><p>tempted to discuss the news of the day, </p><p>Williams had choked him off with more </p><p>palatable suggestion. </p><p> Thus it happened, when coming out of</p><p>the Turkish bath, he encountered one of the </p><p>Pilling brothers, who looked as if he. also, </p><p>had indulged freely. </p><p> “Been having a good time?” asked the</p><p>jovial captain. </p><p> “I have. Smith has called the option,</p><p>you knowr. In about a week our first ship </p><p>will be delivered at the port designated. </p><p>It’s a relief to be free.” </p><p> “What port?”</p><p> \\ illiams wras uninterested but asked for</p><p>the sake of something to say, and Pilling </p><p>told him, adding the information that the </p><p>options given by several other ship-owners, </p><p>friends of his, had likewise been called— </p><p>for delivery at the same or adjacent ports. </p><p>86 </p><p>Adventure</p><p> “Humph,” muttered Williams to himself</p><p>as he walked along the beach, “the firm </p><p>must have charters already from there— </p><p>aren't wasting any time.” </p><p> So he walked along the beach of the</p><p>large watering-place that he remembered </p><p>as a boy as a small fishing village and, </p><p>arriving at the end of the esplanade, sat </p><p>down on a bench to smoke. Presently an </p><p>old man sat down by his side and began to </p><p>read a newspaper. </p><p> “Terrible time coming,” remarked the</p><p>old man after a while. </p><p> “What do you mean?” drawled Williams</p><p>indifferently. </p><p> “What do I mean?” The old was</p><p>annoyed. “Well, I’ll explain, if you can </p><p>not see it for yourself. It means war. </p><p>That shooting of the archduke was the </p><p>starter.” </p><p> “Oh?” The captain dimly remembered</p><p>hearing of that affair. </p><p> “Yes,” went on the other, “I believe it</p><p>was arranged. Those Germans would do </p><p>anything. Cunning devils.” </p><p> “Well, wre should trouble,” remarked</p><p>Williams; “we won’t get into any scrap. </p><p>If we did, we have the navy.” </p><p> The old man snorted.</p><p> “Yes, we have. But we’ll be into it;</p><p>you’ll see that. And the Germans will find </p><p>some way of starving us out.” </p><p> “Eh?” Williams was interested at last.</p><p> “Yes, they will. Cunning devils. You</p><p>can not tell them from Englishmen or </p><p>Americans; they speak the language so </p><p>well. Starve us out, they will. And the </p><p>country’s full of them-4ill spies. Why, </p><p>there goes one of them now.” </p><p> Williams stared at the well-dressed man</p><p>with the single, eyeglass w'ho walked slowly </p><p>past them. </p><p> “How do you know he’s a German?” he</p><p>whispered. </p><p> “That scar—on his cheek—look, quick,”</p><p>hissed the old man. “They get them </p><p>dueling.” </p><p> For a moment Williams sat as if petrified.</p><p>Then with an oath he jumped to his feet </p><p>and began to run toward the railway </p><p>station, leaving the astounded old gentle- </p><p>man to speculate upon his sanity. </p><p> But Captain Williams was quite sane—</p><p>as sane, if not more so, than ever before </p><p>in his life—even if his mind was racing with </p><p>maddening thoughts. </p><p> For it w*as all clear now. He saw the</p><p>scheme from the very beginning. Yet its</p><p>cleverness might w'ell have been too much </p><p>for the brightest of men. Sylvester had </p><p>been scared because he had guessed—or </p><p>knew—that Smith was a German—or, </p><p>more likely, he w-as really a German spy </p><p>and afraid of being discovered by the </p><p>British. For Gib. is a had place for cap- </p><p>tured spies. Besides, Sylvester was a </p><p>British subject—consequently, if be were </p><p>a spy, he was also a traitor. Which ex- </p><p>plained his agitation and Smith’s curious </p><p>expression when Williams had referred to it. </p><p>And how careless Smith had been about </p><p>the price to be paid for the steamers on </p><p>delivery. </p><p> lie had hardly mentioned it, allowing</p><p>Williams to suggest the price. No wonder, </p><p>when he knew that there was no intention </p><p>of paying any delivery money. And how </p><p>easy Smith had been about parting with the </p><p>fifty thousand. Of course, such a tiling </p><p>might happen in business, and the contract </p><p>signed by Williams in the Gibraltar bank </p><p>had mentioned everything, gone into all </p><p>the usual clauses, such as bottomry’ bonds, </p><p>attachments and the like. How Smith </p><p>must have smiled at that. </p><p> What did he care about attachments,</p><p>once the ships were delivered into German </p><p>ports? And wiiat was fifty thousand in </p><p>such a deal—when the option money was </p><p>all that they were going to pay? Oh, he </p><p>sawr it. He saw it. And the options were </p><p>called. Options on at least eight-tenths of </p><p>the shipping of the British Empire. On the </p><p>eve of war they were being delivered to </p><p>German ports. The old man on the bench </p><p>had said that Germany was only waiting </p><p>till some prearranged moment before de- </p><p>claring war, and Williams believed him. </p><p>But would any one else believe? </p><p> By God, he would force them to! Eight-</p><p>tenths of British shipping lured into Ger- </p><p>man ports for ten shillings or less a ton. </p><p>Williams had given little heed that after- </p><p>noon w'hen Pilling had told him that all his </p><p>ships were to be delivered in Hamburg </p><p>and that the ships of other owners who </p><p>had sold options were going to Bremen, </p><p>Hamburg and other German ports. But </p><p>he heeded now. Why, in a week or so all </p><p>those ships would be in German ports, </p><p>and, while the owners waited for their </p><p>money, war would come! How cunning </p><p>that time arrangement, which could be </p><p>extended on excuse, with liberal demurrage. </p><p>Santanta </p><p>87</p><p> Cunning. And the cunning of Smith</p><p>up to the last. He had known Williams </p><p>was pretending to be drunk, and, when he </p><p>shook him in the restaurant, he had spoken </p><p>as if he believed he were speaking to a </p><p>drunken man—must have “guessed that </p><p>America was the only country with enough </p><p>private capital to swing such a deal.” </p><p>Cunning. Yes, he had been cunning. If </p><p>the old man had not called attention </p><p>to the scar on the face of that passing </p><p>German or if that German had not </p><p>passed at the time—but for that, Germany </p><p>would have starved England into sur- </p><p>render in a few weeks. On what tiny </p><p>incidents do the fates of empires hang. </p><p>But would others believe as Williams be- </p><p>lieved? </p><p> Running frantically along the platform,</p><p>his tall hat in his waving hand, the captain </p><p>just caught the train. But would lie be </p><p>in time? Would he be believed? Not </p><p>about the options—that could be proved— </p><p>but about the certainty of war? There </p><p>was no sense in senamg a telegram. He </p><p>would be considered crazy and arrested. </p><p>And there was only one man to see—the </p><p>Prime Minister. But whsft could the </p><p>minister do, even if Williams made him </p><p>believe that the option-buying was a war </p><p>move? </p><p> The captain had no idea, but he had</p><p>great faith in that important official. He </p><p>would see him—even if he had to fight his </p><p>way to him. The shipping of the empire </p><p>tricked irfto Germany’s ports—at ten shil- </p><p>lings or less a ton. Yes, they were clever. </p><p>But for the scar he would never have </p><p>guessed it. Slice-bar,-! He had thought </p><p>it a queer, unhandy sort of weapon when </p><p>Smith had told him the lie. </p><p> Williams did not sleep that night, and,</p><p>when in the very early morning he reached </p><p>London, he raced to the first taxi on the </p><p>stand, shouting to the surprized driver— </p><p> “Number 10 Downing Street, and drive</p><p>like-!” </p><p> And the minister’s servants were also</p><p>surprized. They were accustomed to </p><p>cranks of all sorts, but this big man seemed </p><p>different. He didn’t shout or rave, and </p><p>his low, tense voice was commanding. </p><p>Still, they couldn’t let him in. It was too </p><p>early, they explained. Would he come </p><p>again later? Later they would be pre- </p><p>pared for him. </p><p> But Williams refused to come later. He</p><p>wanted to see the Prime Minister right</p><p>away. If he were still in bed, he must be </p><p>wakened. The matter could not wait. </p><p>And he made as if to push by them. </p><p> The servants looked at one another—</p><p>two big footmen, but neither of them </p><p>anxious to tackle this big madman. One </p><p>made a sign—phone the police while he </p><p>held the fellow off with talk. But the </p><p>captain saw the sign and guessed its mean- </p><p>ing. With head down—top hat still in </p><p>place—he was preparing to charge as he </p><p>would have charged refractory sailors, </p><p>when another voice broke in— </p><p> “What is it, James?”</p><p> And Williams saw the Prime Minister</p><p>coming dqwn the hall. He never remem- </p><p>bered how he obtained that interview. </p><p>His torrent of words was beyond his con- </p><p>trol. But he found himself sitting in a </p><p>famous room alone with the great man— </p><p>where the fate of Britain had so often been </p><p>decided. </p><p>WHILE the world knows that, just </p><p>before the outbreak of war, Ger- </p><p>many nearly succeeded in trapping </p><p>a part of the British navy in Kiel, this is </p><p>the first published account of her almost </p><p>successful attempt to trap eight-tenths of </p><p>the British merchant fleet and so starve </p><p>England into an early and ignominious </p><p>surrender. </p><p>santanta </p><p>BY W. A. STERNBERG </p><p>TIAT portion of Kansas now </p><p>included within the boundaries </p><p>of Ellswwth County was diffi- </p><p>cult to reclaim from the red </p><p>men. The country was well grassed and </p><p>watered, with sheltering belts of timber </p><p>along the streams, making it a favorite </p><p>Indian hunting-ground, swarming as it was </p><p>with buffalo, elk, antelope and smaller </p><p>game. White buffalo-hunters soon learned </p><p>how desirable the country was and made </p><p>persistent and finally successful efforts to </p><p>88 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>establish homes there; all praise to those </p><p>courageous pioneers! </p><p> General Hancock, in the Summer of</p><p>1867, was at Fort Harker organising an </p><p>expedition against the Indians; that cam- </p><p>paign and its failure have passed into </p><p>history, but an amusing incident connected </p><p>with it will be recalled by surviving “old </p><p>settlers.” This incident might properly </p><p>be entitled, “How the famous war-chief, </p><p>Santanta, bull-conned the general.”</p><p> Hancock made great effort, to conciliate</p><p>the hostiles. He had several talks with </p><p>Santanta and his chiefs, carefully observing </p><p>traditional Indian council formalities. The </p><p>pipe of peace was smoked in solemn state </p><p>and much big talk followed. The love and </p><p>affection of the Great Father at Washing- </p><p>ton for liis red children was carefully </p><p>explained, as it had been time and again </p><p>for more than a hundred years. Many </p><p>valuable presents were made the Indians, </p><p>and among others General Hancock gave </p><p>Santanta a complete major-general’s uni- </p><p>form; sword, sash, epaulets, and gorgeous </p><p>cocked hat and plume. But the talks all </p><p>ended in smoke. </p><p> General Hancock wanted to get his</p><p>troops alongside the Indian camp, but </p><p>Santanta divined his purpose and pro- </p><p>longed the talk until all his women and </p><p>children got away; as soon as this was </p><p>safely accomplished, he and his warriors </p><p>made themselves scarce. This expedition </p><p>proving a failure, it was soon disbanded. </p><p> Not long before General Hancock’s first</p><p>talk with Santanta the Indians Lad cap- </p><p>tured a Government ambulance with its </p><p>team of four mules. Santanta represented </p><p>to the general the capture of this ambulance </p><p>was not approved by him, that it was the act </p><p>of some of his young men, who, he was </p><p>sorry to say, did not love their Father in </p><p>Washington as Santanta did. That it </p><p>would afford him great pleasure to return </p><p>the Great Father his mules and ambulance, </p><p>but unfortunately at that moment he was </p><p>off color with liis braves by reason of his </p><p>great love for the white man, ami Aval </p><p>chiefs pointed the finger of scorn at </p><p>him, saying he had a white man’s heart. </p><p>That if Santanta should take these mules </p><p>and ambulance from the young men, thev </p><p>would not listen when he should urge </p><p>them to be like Santanta, a friend of the </p><p>while man and obey the great white chief </p><p>And much more of the same chaff—all with </p><p>one object, which he accomplished. The </p><p>capture of the mules and ambulance—and </p><p>the killing of the driver—was passed over, </p><p>and they tacitly went with the oilier </p><p>presents. </p><p> I have a vivid recollection—the danger</p><p>from Indians having passed until grass </p><p>should be green again—being at Fort </p><p>Harker one day. of seeing a four-mule </p><p>ambulance rapidly approaching the post </p><p>along the Fort Zara trail, the mules lashed </p><p>to a gallop by a filthy breech-clouted</p><p>Indian. The curtains had been cut away, </p><p>and there in his major-general’s uniform, </p><p>epaulets, cocked hat, plume and all, with </p><p>boiled shirt worn outside his trousers, arms </p><p>folded, face covered^ith dirt and dignity, </p><p>sat the renowned terror of the plains, the </p><p>redoubtable Santanta. His driver put the </p><p>mules around the parade-ground once or </p><p>twice, encouraging them with such fiendish </p><p>yells as only an Indian can produce. </p><p>When the importance of his chief had been </p><p>sufficiently exhibited, he stopped, and </p><p>Santanta paid a visit of state to liis brother. </p><p>General Sully. </p><p> Santanta was low in stature, broad-</p><p>shouldered, deep-chested and crooked- </p><p>legged, and, seated there in a captured </p><p>Government ambulance, wearing the uni- </p><p>form of a major-general in the United </p><p>Slates Army, his broad face greasy and </p><p>horrid, he made a picture which was not a </p><p>caricature but a sad commentary on the </p><p>Government's then paternal method of </p><p>dealing with Indians. </p><p> With the next season's grass came those</p><p>dark and bloody days which are burned </p><p>deep into the memory of the surviving early </p><p>settlers of Lincoln and Ellsworth Counties </p><p>and which established Santanta's reputa- </p><p>tion as one of the most cruel ravages the </p><p>plains ever produced. </p><p> A Night in</p><p>the Wilderness </p><p>BY </p><p> 'WAL7' McDOVGALL</p><p>Author of “Pikers Afloat.” </p><p>I HAD been in the out-of-the-way Eng- </p><p>lish inn for three days before I noticed </p><p>that Jarvis wore service stripes. He </p><p>was flitting noiselessly, like a bam </p><p>swallow, about the low-ceiled tap-room </p><p>where I had sat alone for an idle hour, </p><p>when I remarked— </p><p> “I see you’ve served, Jarvis.”</p><p> “Harrdly, sor. I got strafed the very</p><p>first day I landed in Belgium, sor. In the </p><p>neck, sor. I wasn’t out of England a </p><p>week.” </p><p>“Are you an Irishman, Jarvis?” I queried. </p><p>“Well, not exactly, sor. Me mother </p><p>was a Jewess and me father a Yorkshire- </p><p>man, but I was born and raised in Dublin </p><p>until I was seventeen years old.” </p><p> “Ireland must be some melting-pot!”</p><p>I mused aloud. </p><p> “Well, sor, it is in a way, but not like</p><p>the States, sor. I’ve been to Hamerica, </p><p>sor.”</p><p> “Oho! I thought I detected an .American</p><p>accent!” </p><p> “Well, ye’d harrdly say that, sor. I</p><p>wasn’t there long enough for that!” </p><p> “Were you in New York?” I questioned,</p><p>for his respectful and serious air seemed to </p><p>mask a certain sly humor that promised </p><p>some amusement. </p><p> He seemed more like a schoolmaster</p><p>than a waiter. </p><p> “In New York, yes, sor, and to Green-</p><p>wood Lake, New Jersey. Do you know </p><p>that place, sor?” he asked. </p><p> “Every foot of it,” I replied. “I’ve</p><p>been going there since I was a boy.” </p><p> “Indade! I’ve only met three people in</p><p>me life that had visited it. Then, sor, </p><p>you may have known Degraw’s Hotel, </p><p>loikely?” </p><p>a. </p><p> “As well as my own club. But I don’t</p><p>recall you, Jarvis.” </p><p> “ ’Twas manny years ago, sor, and I</p><p>wasn’t there long,” he said with a sigh, </p><p>gazing reflectively down the hedge-bor- </p><p>dered lane. “It’s sorry I am, often enough, </p><p>that I didn’t stick it out.” </p><p> “What was the matter with Greenwood</p><p>Lake?” I demanded. </p><p> “Faith, nawthin’ at alt sor!” he an-</p><p>swered as if surprized. “The Lake was </p><p>perfectly satisfactory—a good bit of all </p><p>right, sor. But I had a peculiar experience </p><p>there, one that I don't talk about much.” </p><p>Without a hint of warning that I was </p><p>about to get a jolt from out of the halcyon, </p><p>carefree life of long ago, I spoke up: </p><p> “Wrell, this is a good talking day.

I’ve seen only farmin’ </p><p>machinery,” I says. </p><p> “Oh, you’ll not see a cowboy this side of</p><p>Chicago!” says Mr. Degraw. “You must </p><p>know,' says he, “that there’s little excite- </p><p>ment up here in the mountains. All the </p><p>bad-men, gun-fighters and train-robbers </p><p>hang out in the big cities, and, if you’re </p><p>keen for that sort of life, you should have </p><p>stayed in New York.” </p><p> The weather was bally hot, sor, the</p><p>thermometer hanging in the car registerin’ </p><p>all of eighty-tnree. Quite bloomin’ trop- </p><p>ical, indeed! But, about the time I was </p><p>minded to remove my coat as my employer </p><p>and everybody else had done, we arrived </p><p>in higher regions, and I preserved my self- </p><p>respect, sor. It was much cooler at the </p><p>Lake. </p><p> The bar, sor, was in the pool-room, near</p><p>the water some distance from the hotel; </p><p>the stock was very superior, and I thought </p><p>that whole situation wasn’t half bad. The </p><p>landlord instructed me in misan’ many </p><p>Hamerican drinks next mornin’. In the </p><p>daytime ’twas mostly lydies who frequented </p><p>the pool-room, playin’ lhe game very skill- </p><p>fully, 1 should say, but I gathered from </p><p>their conversation that Saturdays and </p><p>Sundays were much enlivened by the </p><p>presence of husbands. </p><p> It was an extraordinary quiet spot, sor,</p><p>my word! I anticipated much from the </p><p>expected arrival towards evening of a favor- </p><p>ite visitor, a newspaper-man from Newark, </p><p>in the Province of New Jersey, by name of </p><p>Mack, who was an inveterate joker. </p><p> I gathered the idea that he was some sort</p><p>of a big mogul from hearing Mrs. Degraw </p><p>tell another lydy that Mack was a prince; </p><p>that he was a genuine Indian. I was</p><p>charmed at the idea, don’t you know, of </p><p>encountering one of the aboriginal princes, </p><p>for Mr. Degraw had told me that they were </p><p>rapidly passing away because of their </p><p>adoption of the vice of dgaret smoking. </p><p> It was an orfal hot day, incredible hot,</p><p>sor, witherin’, as you might sav, but </p><p>nobody seemed to mind it. Actually, the </p><p>landlord’s wife had worn a beaver’ cape </p><p>over her shoulders that mornin’. ’Twas </p><p>eighty six at three o’clock when Mr. Mack </p><p>and his friends arrived, bringing with him, </p><p>for their entertainment, a brass hand of five </p><p>men. He was a man in his forties, fat, </p><p>dark-haired, with piercing brown eyes </p><p>and a grand out jutting nose. But his skin </p><p>was as fair as your own, sor. </p><p> Still, he had the gloomy stem look that</p><p>one naturally would expect in an Indian </p><p>chief, and the preposterous heat seemed </p><p>to have no effect upon him or his friends </p><p>except to give ’em a thirst. He was very </p><p>affable indeed—no royal airs at all—and he </p><p>asked me manny questions about the old </p><p>counthry after the landlord told him I was </p><p>from Ireland—especially about banshees, </p><p>pLxies and the likes o’ that. </p><p> There was two of them that hadn't come,</p><p>by name of O’Toole and O'Keefe, being </p><p>kept by other ingagements until night, </p><p>when they were cornin' by carriage, a fifty- </p><p>mile trip! Sorry the day they ever started! </p><p>The German band serenaded the ladies </p><p>at the hotel, and then they all took posses- </p><p>sion' of the pool-room—all but the Indian </p><p>prince and an artist chap. who went out </p><p>fishin’. I asked Mr. Degraw what his </p><p>Highness preferred in the way of liquor. </p><p> “What d’ve mean, Highness?” says he.</p><p> “The Indian prince, sor. Mr. Mack,</p><p>sor,” I says. </p><p> “Who told you he was an Injin?” he</p><p>asks. </p><p> “I heard your good lydy say so, sor,</p><p>yesterday. I presume tiiis is the same </p><p>gentleman, sor,” says I. </p><p> “Gosh! It’s a mighty good thing, young</p><p>feller, that you spoke to me about him. </p><p>If he suspected that you knew he was an </p><p>Injin, it’s ten to one that he’d scalp you </p><p>before you knew he had his knife out! </p><p>Don’t open your face and let out any </p><p>‘highness’ or 'prince’ stuff while he’s here— </p><p>not on your hatpin! Not on your hat- </p><p>pin!” says he! </p><p> If all Hamericans were like that parrty,</p><p>Prohibition would have come in the States </p><p>long years ago through a natural failure of</p><p>supplies, sor! Sure, they kept Degraw </p><p>and me busy ordering tilings by names that </p><p>A Night in the Wilderness </p><p>9i </p><p>I more than suspect they invented right </p><p>there, and more than one deadly quarrel </p><p>Degraw only previnted by smoothness </p><p>and blarney, the wise man! The German </p><p>band, doubtless, aided him in that, begad! </p><p>It was a fine one! </p><p>WHEN the prince returned, he </p><p>brought with him a snake he’d </p><p>just caught. He handled it in a </p><p>manner to chili your blood. They told </p><p>me he had a fondness for the creatures and </p><p>often carried them about in his pockets. </p><p>He said it was a brindled rattlesnake and </p><p>extremely poisonous but that he had it </p><p>charmed, as you might say, and offered to </p><p>let me hold it in my hands. </p><p> Wurroo! Sor, I can feel at this minute</p><p>the deadly chill that struck down my </p><p>legs as he reached the squirmin’ sarpent </p><p>toward me! He said he'd keep it to show </p><p>Petey O’Toole, who was addicted to snakes </p><p>even when he was sober, and he put it into </p><p>his trousers pocket! </p><p> For men of their age—for they were all</p><p>years older than me—that was the liveliest </p><p>crowd I ever saw. They frolicked like </p><p>schoolboys and drank like bloomin’ hatters. </p><p>With wrastlin’ and boxin’ and jumpin’ in </p><p>that torrid heat, sor, they sported till sun- </p><p>down, and in the cool o’ the evenin' they </p><p>sat around listening to the sweet strains </p><p>of the band. </p><p> By and by they began to boast of their</p><p>doin’s to annoy Mr. Degraw, for I had </p><p>soon discovered that he was the county </p><p>sheriff. And, sor, I heard some shockin’ </p><p>details of crime. But Degratv only laughed </p><p>and said it was lucky for them that these </p><p>deeds had been outlawed by the Immunity </p><p>Act, or they’d be dissolving in quick- </p><p>lime that very hour. And a milder-lookin’ </p><p>lot of blokes you couldn't have found on </p><p>anny Summer night the world over! </p><p> Every onct in a while somebody would</p><p>regret the absince of O’Toole and O’Keefe, </p><p>and that would start another story about </p><p>one or the other of these men, something </p><p>that would start off innocint, belike, and </p><p>wind up with the creeps in your liver, sor! </p><p> “D’ye mind,” says one, “the time they</p><p>stole the red-hot stove from the Mamin’ </p><p>Register Office and piled pavin’ stones agin </p><p>the door and sat there in the snow-storm </p><p>till daylight drinkin’ applejack while the</p><p>police was cartin’ away the stones, afraid to </p><p>meddle with 'em?” </p><p> “I do that!” says the prince. “ ’Twas</p><p>the very next day that O’Keefe attacked </p><p>me with a Cuban machete in Murray’s </p><p>saloon, and I had to lay him out with a </p><p>brass cuspidor. I carry the scar of the </p><p>cut he gave me to this day. But those </p><p>were rough old times! You remember the </p><p>night O’Toole got the cab-drivers into </p><p>Mink’s to buy them a drink and we stole </p><p>every cab in Newark and drove to Belleville </p><p>with them?” </p><p> “Yes. That was awful! O'Keefe had</p><p>no excuse for killin' the mayor of Belleville, </p><p>even if it was a Prohibition town!” says </p><p>another chap. “Just because the mayor </p><p>called him a white-livered Home Rule mick </p><p>from Galway! T wasn’t right!” </p><p> You may see, sor, that I did not regret</p><p>the absince of these two men from this </p><p>social gatherin’, for I could readily perceive </p><p>that they were desperate characters of the </p><p>type depicted by Bret Harrte in his “ Jumpin' </p><p>Frog” stories, although I gathered that they </p><p>were Irishmen of a sort. But a bit later </p><p>we heard shots in the distance, and almost </p><p>immediately afterward came the two des- </p><p>peraydoes in the vehicle they call by the </p><p>curious name of “buggy,” sor. One of </p><p>them—that was O’Toole—was a small, red- </p><p>headed, skinny chap with a mild eye, the </p><p>verry last you’d take for a bad one, and the </p><p>other was more like a parson than a hard- </p><p>ened murderer, a fine, tall, clean-lookin' </p><p>lad with curly hair but very profane with </p><p>his language. </p><p> “Hurroo! We did the fifty miles in two</p><p>and a half hours, swoppin’ horses every five </p><p>miles!” sings out O’Keefe. </p><p> “You’re a liar. It can’t be did!” says</p><p>the prince. </p><p> “You’re no gentleman, you decrepit old</p><p>horse-thief. It was did!” says O’Toole, </p><p>climbin’ down in a hurry. “We'll have </p><p>the constables of nine towns after us for </p><p>shooting up each burg we passed through!” </p><p>They all crowded indoors, and O’Keefe </p><p>yells out: </p><p> “Rum! Rum! And a bucket of blood!”</p><p> Mr. Degraw whispers to me:</p><p> “Be discreet, me boy, in talkin’ to these</p><p>birds. They’ve been drinkin’ some; I can </p><p>see that. We don’t want anv trouble here </p><p>tonight!” </p><p> “Give us a couple of nitroglvcerin cock-</p><p>tails!” yells O’Keefe. </p><p> “We are all out of nitroglycerin,” says</p><p>Mr. Degraw very smooth. </p><p>92 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Nix! Nix! None of that stuff!” O’Toole</p><p>bawls out, and the man reaches for his hip </p><p>pocket, his little eyes blazin’. </p><p> “Hold on! Don’t draw, for you might</p><p>have to shoot ! ’ says Degraw as cool as you </p><p>please. “I may have some up at the </p><p>house.” </p><p> He went after it, and he was gone-some</p><p>time. The prince motioned O’Toole to </p><p>come outside, and I could see him talkin’ </p><p>earnestly to him in the light from the </p><p>doorway. 1 conjectured that he was ad- </p><p>visin’ him to act with discretion. </p><p> Well, sor, if I could have been whisked</p><p>out o' that and over to old Ireland by </p><p>givin’ up ten years o’ my life, I’d gladly </p><p>have done it! Every time O’Toole's eye </p><p>rested on me, ray insides froze—and ’twas </p><p>a hot night, d’ye mind! When Mr. Degraw </p><p>came back, he had a tumbler half full of </p><p>some white stuff that he hands to O’Toole, </p><p>and says he: </p><p> “Here’s your soul-poisoner, and may you</p><p>choke! I had to steal it from under old </p><p>Duy Foster’s bed while he was asleep. If </p><p>he’d woke up, he would have bored me!” </p><p>O'Toole takes it, and says he: </p><p> “None of your tricks! Are you sure</p><p>you’re not trying to slip over some of that </p><p>turpentine flavorin’ or French perfume like </p><p>you did the last time!” </p><p> “Taste it, you rattlesnake!” says Degraw.</p><p>O'Toole tasted it, smiled and passed it to </p><p>O’Keefe. </p><p> “ ’Tis the real old safe-blowin’ juice—and</p><p>fresh!” says he. “Mix the cocktails—and </p><p>for all hands, d’ye mind.” </p><p> Then they all began to protest that they</p><p>didn't drink that deadly stuff, but O’Keefe </p><p>pulls out a pistol, sor. and, when the drinks </p><p>was mixed, they drank them without </p><p>objectin’. O’Toole shook his head with </p><p>his mouth wide open, and says he, “Boys, </p><p>if I gritted my teeth, I’d blast my jaw off! </p><p>Now it’s whisky and other soft stuff that </p><p>I’ll have to stick to tonight. O’Keefe, I’ll </p><p>play you a game of pool, though my hands </p><p>are raw from drivin’ them fiery, untamed </p><p>steeds.” </p><p> With that they went to playing pool,</p><p>me v'atchin' them, and divvle a one of ’em </p><p>was showin’ any effects from drinkin’ the </p><p>stuff, sor! The prince whispered to De- </p><p>graw, and he came to me and told me to </p><p>water some whisky in a bottle and serve</p><p>these two with it as they were like to make </p><p>trouble. I done that same, and the very </p><p>next time they took a drink they spat and </p><p>looked hard at me. My blood’ turned to </p><p>ice, sor! O’Toole put his hand across </p><p>O’Keefe’s chest, and says he: </p><p> “Hold on, John, no killin'! Mabbe the</p><p>boy has a mother as you had onct.” </p><p> “Since when has a mere mother—or even</p><p>a mother-in-law, for the matter o’ that- </p><p>stopped you or me, Petey O’Toole! He’s </p><p>watered our booze!” </p><p> The whole crowd threw themselves on</p><p>them, and Degraw told them I’d given </p><p>them whisky out of the bottle reserved for </p><p>the man with delirium trimmins that was </p><p>boarding there. Finally O’Keefe calmed </p><p>down and went back to the pool-table. </p><p>The prince called on the band for music. </p><p>I could see that there was bad blood between </p><p>the two, and I never took my eyes off them, </p><p>sor. In the midst of the music they began </p><p>to quarrel over the game, callin’ each other </p><p>mortal bad names. Just as the band </p><p>stopped playin’, O’Keefe shook his fist </p><p>in O’Toole’s face, and says he— </p><p> “You half-portion of a Hackensack</p><p>coprolite!” </p><p> I mind the word well. O’Toole stepped</p><p>back, pulled out a revolver and with a yell </p><p>fired straight at O’Keefe’s stomach, not a </p><p>yard away! He fell without a word—just </p><p>crumpled up, dropped on his face, turned </p><p>over and lay still there beside the pool- </p><p>table. </p><p>EVEN in that horrible moment, </p><p>sor, 1 noticed that all of them turned </p><p>and looked at me instead of at the </p><p>murderer. That is, all except the German </p><p>band, who were too frightened to move. </p><p>O’Toole dropped the pistol and darted out </p><p>into the darkness, but-the crowd fell over </p><p>each other to get out after him. I did </p><p>not feel that it was my duty to join them, </p><p>as I was a foreigner, don’t you know, but </p><p>I would have been of no service as I was </p><p>badly funked. </p><p> I suppose I was as pale as the band-</p><p>leader, who sat staring at the corpse in </p><p>horror. One man soon returned and asked </p><p>me where he could get a rope to hang the </p><p>murderer with when they caught him. </p><p>Before I could reply, he took down Mrs. </p><p>Degraw’s beaver cape that hung on a peg </p><p>on the wall and covered up the head and </p><p>shoulders of the dead man in a solemn </p><p>and reverent manner that quite touched me, </p><p>sor.</p><p>A Night in the Wilderness </p><p>93 </p><p> I could hear them yellin’ and makin</p><p>uncouth sounds in the distance for some </p><p>time as they searched, but soon they all </p><p>drifted in—all but the prince and Degraw. </p><p>They told me that these two, who were old </p><p>woodsmen, would soon round up the black- </p><p>hearted spalpeen and bring him back dead </p><p>or alive. The prince, they said, was quite </p><p>likely to kill him first and ask questions </p><p>afterward. They told me to remember </p><p>every detail, for I w'ould be the most im- </p><p>portant witness, and this made me very </p><p>nervous. Every few minutes one or two </p><p>of them were compelled by their emotions </p><p>to go outside. </p><p> Suddenly there came a wild, thrillin’</p><p>yell from out of the dark, starless night. </p><p>Out they rushed. Between the dead man </p><p>inside and a murderer loose outside I felt </p><p>like siftin' tight, sor. When they came in, </p><p>they had the artist chap, drippin’ wet, who </p><p>said that he had been pushed into the </p><p>lake by some unseen hand. lie thought </p><p>it was O'Toole’s. I was much upset by </p><p>their indecent levity, sor, for they split </p><p>their sides at his misfortune even in the </p><p>presence of the corpse. It was quite </p><p>shockin’! </p><p> None of them knew the bally counthry</p><p>about there, and they were afraid of bein’ </p><p>lost in the dark. Besides, O'Toole was </p><p>well armed, having another pistol besides </p><p>the one he had dropped, as I omitted to </p><p>mention, beside the corpse and which had </p><p>been laid behind the bar right near me, </p><p>which increased my nervous horrors. They </p><p>knew so many details about the lives of </p><p>O'Toole and O’Keefe and related so many </p><p>of them, sor, that I was really made </p><p>quite ill. </p><p> Finally along about midnight a loud</p><p>war-whoop that chilled my veins called </p><p>them out, and soon they returned with the </p><p>villain O’Toole. They had evidently </p><p>handled him roughly enough, and Sheriff </p><p>Degraw had handcuffed him so that he was </p><p>quite harmless, as you might say. But he </p><p>glared at me as if about to spring at me, </p><p>and the artist chap got between us. And </p><p>he says: </p><p> “Let us give this fiend in human shape</p><p>a dose of lynch-law right here and now and </p><p>string him up. He’s as guilty as-says </p><p>he, "and he’s cheated the gallow's many </p><p>times already. You remember how he got </p><p>off after killing Lhe old woman over at</p><p>Smoky Hollow?” </p><p> “We do that,” says the prince. “And do</p><p>you mind how he slipped out of the noose </p><p>the time he cut the throats of the two </p><p>school-teachers in Goshen?” </p><p> “Sure! He’s a bally bad one!” gaid the</p><p>sheriff. “It’s agin my oath of office to </p><p>countenance such work, but we’ll try him </p><p>tonight.” </p><p> “Can’t you wait until tomorrow so I can</p><p>send for a lawyer?” asks O’Toole with a </p><p>groan. </p><p> “We can not!” says the prince. “You’ll</p><p>have to play your hand alone this time, </p><p>Petey, me boy.” </p><p> So they started to try him. They made</p><p>me give my testimony first. It was a </p><p>sweatin’ job, sor, with O’Toole’s devilish </p><p>eyes burnin’ holes into me bewhilst. When </p><p>I was through, Degraw says: </p><p> “We saw it all. A hundred witnesses</p><p>wouldn’t add to the proof. We’ll hang </p><p>him on young Jarvis’ evidence alone.” </p><p>“He’s done for me!” says O’Toole. “It’s </p><p>lucky for him that this is a dirty lynch-law </p><p>trial, or I’d get him sure later: As it is, </p><p>my spook will hant you, young feller, till </p><p>your dyin’ day! May your food choke you! </p><p>May your booze taste like bilge-water! </p><p>May your feet be cold in Winter and roast </p><p>in Summer! And may your wife take your </p><p>earnings to Asbury Park!” </p><p> “Be reasonable, O’Toole!'’ says the</p><p>prince. “The boy’s only done his duty </p><p>to the counthry-” </p><p> “He’s no better than a lousy informer!,,</p><p>cries O’Toole. “Men, I ask you as a per- </p><p>sonal favor not to hang me like a horse- </p><p>thief! Shoot me and let me die like the </p><p>good old scout I am! O’Keefe only got </p><p>what was cornin’ to him, and well he de- </p><p>served it. He stole both my wives. I </p><p>forgave him and, in fact, paid the carfare </p><p>on- one occasion. I overlooks his weakness </p><p>when he double-crossed me the time we </p><p>robbed the Prudential Bank and killed the </p><p>old cashier, w'ho was my second-cousin. </p><p>But he wrent too far for human endurance </p><p>the night he set the opera house on fire </p><p>and burned up ninety-six women and </p><p>children!” </p><p> “Ah! Did he do that deed?” asks</p><p>Degraw. He was that overcome he leans </p><p>on the shoulder of the prince, and both of </p><p>them were sobbin’, sor. But the prince </p><p>with a deep frown says: </p><p> “Raw stuff, Pete3', and old! This isn’t</p><p>a Newark jury.”</p><p>94 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Take off these cuffs and shoot me</p><p>quick!” says the man. “I have thirty </p><p>dollars in me jeans. Send them to the </p><p>Elk’s Lodge for to bury me with.” </p><p> “Hand them here,” says the artist chap.</p><p>“I’ll attend to that.” </p><p> “The - you will!” says O’Toole.</p><p>“Only over my dead body, you four-eyed </p><p>ink-slinger! I’ll match you for the thirty!” </p><p>Degraw took off the handcuffs and says, </p><p>says he: </p><p> “Now, stand over here by the corpse.</p><p>Jarvis, you hand me that gun on the shelf </p><p>yonder. I'll shoot you myself.” </p><p> Faith, I was mighty slow in reachin’ for</p><p>the weapon, as you may well believe, sor, </p><p>and, before I laid my hand on it, O’Toole </p><p>leaped through the door like a bloomin’ </p><p>rabbit and was gone wid the whole pack </p><p>after him, yellin’ like fiends! All, that is, </p><p>but the artist chap, and he says in great </p><p>alarm: </p><p> “Hide behind the bar, lad! You’re as</p><p>good as dead if he doubles back in the dark </p><p>to get you! It was your evidence that </p><p>convicted him, and he’ll take a chance </p><p>to pay ypu back!” </p><p> I laid myself down behind the bar, and</p><p>there I stayed until they all returned. </p><p> “We’ll put the bloodhounds on his trail</p><p>in the morning—if I can finish with my </p><p>havin’,” says the sheriff. </p><p> “It’s on my mind that he’ll drown hisself</p><p>in the lake,” says the prince. “He'll never </p><p>be able to survive the loss of O'Keefe. </p><p>They were partners in crime for many years, </p><p>and O’Keefe’s ghost will hant him until </p><p>he makes away with hisself—you can </p><p>gamble on that.” </p><p> Just then the bandmaster stands up</p><p>rather unsteadily, and says he— </p><p> “Vot iss the matter mil playin' a dirge</p><p>for dot dead man, alretty?” </p><p> “That’s a splendid idea. O’Keefe w^as</p><p>fond of music!” </p><p>WELL, sor, the band, which was </p><p>pretty well soused, as you might </p><p>say, played somethin’ slow and sad- </p><p>like, and*it affected their hearers so that </p><p>some of them had to go outside to hide </p><p>their feelin’s. But the prince spoiled </p><p>it all by ordering drinks, and then they </p><p>missed me. Degraw came behind the bar, </p><p>and says he— </p><p> “And what do you there?” he asks.</p><p> “They say he’s apt to come back for me,”</p><p>says I. “Sor, could I go to my room?” </p><p>“Shucks! That cheap Irish loafer! That </p><p>imitation barroom scrapper! He won’t </p><p>have the sand to come within five miles </p><p>of me! I’d bore him as full of holes as a </p><p>Swiss cheese!” says Degraw. </p><p> With l hat I looks up, and there stands</p><p>O*Toole, glaring down through the window. </p><p>I he sheriff yelled, and everybody rushed </p><p>outside. I stood up and grabbed the </p><p>pistol just as he leaps into the room. Sor, </p><p>1 was that scared 1 points the gun straight </p><p>at his chest and fires, but he never turns </p><p>a hair! I never fired a pistol before in my </p><p>life, and 1 expected to see him drop at my </p><p>feet. But instead he steps up and says: </p><p>“You’d do better work with a brick! </p><p>Gimme a drink, you poor boob!” </p><p> I drops the gun and hands him the bottle,</p><p>and there he stood drinkin' out of it when </p><p>the gang rushes back. </p><p> “Boys, I give up!” he sings out. “I’m</p><p>through! I’m afraid of the dark out there, </p><p>and the Willies are chasin' me. O'Keefe's </p><p>spook, all pale and wavin’ blue flames, </p><p>follows me about and calls me a four- </p><p>flushin’ piker! String me up and end my </p><p>misery!” </p><p> My word, sor, I was flabbergasted!</p><p>“O'Keefe’s spook!” said the prince. </p><p>“That man hasn’t been croaked long </p><p>enough to have a spook! The human jack- </p><p>rabbit never had soul enough to get an </p><p>X-ray of a spook that would show three </p><p>feet away! For that matter, we’ve been </p><p>prancin’ around here for two hours without </p><p>overhauling the corpse. How do we know </p><p>that he is dead, at all, at all?” </p><p> “Oh, he’s croaked, all right!” says the</p><p>artist chap. “Rigor mortis and alco- </p><p>holic decomposition set in long ago. He </p><p>smells like sour mash! He’s laid there </p><p>under that fur cape without twit chin’ since </p><p>ten o’clock, but let the murderer lay his </p><p>hand on the dead body and make a test. </p><p>That will prove it!’’ </p><p> “Never! Never!” groaned the murderer,</p><p>shrink in’ back and takin' a pull on the </p><p>bottle. “Let this bartender do it!” </p><p>“Nonsense!” says the prince. “There’s </p><p>one sure test. Tickle the stiff just under </p><p>the first rib. If he moves, there’s life in him. ” </p><p>Well, sor, just as one of them stepped </p><p>toward the corpse, it drew up its legs over </p><p>its stomach! My flesh crept, and my </p><p>hair stood up. Then I saw that it was </p><p>protectin' itself against the expected </p><p>HI</p><p>The Wagon-Box Fight </p><p>95 </p><p>tickling. But, before I could realize what it </p><p>meant, O’Keefe throws off the fur cape and </p><p>gets up on his feet! Says he: </p><p> “You-fools must think this is a five-</p><p>reel film production! Gimme a drink, </p><p>quick! My -! My mouth tastes like </p><p>the subway, and my belly is so sore from </p><p>holdin in the laughs that I feel as if I had </p><p>appendicitis!’’ </p><p>IISI! JARVIS paused a moment before </p><p>||||||| he made the final confession of his </p><p>tale. </p><p> “Then, sor, it came to me in a flash that</p><p>they' had been spoofin’ me all along! They </p><p>were blank cartridges in the pistols!” </p><p> “And then, Jarvis, you went over the top</p><p>and tried to clean out the bunch.” </p><p> “I did that, sor! I handed that O’Toole</p><p>desperaydo one that jolted him a good bit, </p><p>but they overpowered me. They told me </p><p>that one poke proved my courage, and theyr </p><p>all shook hands with me, and the band </p><p>played ‘The Wearin’.of the Green,’ and, sor, </p><p>I think we got a bit drunk, sor. But how </p><p>did you happen to guess what I did, sor?” </p><p> “I didn’t guess, Jarvis. I was there</p><p>that night. I am the artist chap, and </p><p>Harry Mack, the prince, was ray brother. </p><p>I fell in the lake while trying to get a peep </p><p>at your face. Man! Man! If I should </p><p>laugh now as we laughed that night, I’d </p><p>crack something! Ah, that was long, long </p><p>ago, old-timer. O’Toole has been county </p><p>treasurer for years; O’Keefe owns a news- </p><p>paper. And Harry has gone over, and </p><p>there’s nobody can do such things now!” </p><p>“But, sor, for the life of me, I never could </p><p>understand why they did it, sor. They </p><p>couldn’t have expected to find me there, </p><p>the poor greenhorn, and yet they started </p><p>off their spoofin’ the minute they’ came! </p><p>And them two the worst of all, sor! Did </p><p>the landlord play the trick on me, sor?” </p><p>“Never, Jarvis! He was no jokesmith. </p><p>It was your innocent Irish face did it, </p><p>all on the spur of the moment, for those were </p><p>gifted improvisers, and a hint to O’Toole </p><p>and O’Keefe was enough.” </p><p> “Well, axmyway, I went back to old Ire-</p><p>land three days after, and that’s all I ever </p><p>see of the States, sor.” </p><p>THE WAGON-BOX FIGHT </p><p> by E. _A. BRININSTOOL</p><p>U[QUESTIONABLY the greatest </p><p>battle between white men and </p><p>Indians ever fought in the West—</p><p>taking into consideration the </p><p>small number of whites and the awful </p><p>death-toll they inflicted—was what is </p><p>known historically as the W’agon-box </p><p>Fight of August 2, 1867, which occurred </p><p>some twenty miles southeast of the present </p><p>city of Sheridan, Wyoming, and about six </p><p>miles from old Fort Phil Kearney, at that </p><p>time one of the important military posts </p><p>on the new wagon road which had been </p><p>opened by the Government to Bozeman, </p><p>Montana. In this fight, thirty-two sol- </p><p>diers and civilian wood-choppers, stationed </p><p>at the fort, were surrounded in a corral </p><p>made of the beds of the wagons used in </p><p>transporting logs to the fort, by three </p><p>thousand Sioux warriors under command </p><p>of Chief Red Cloud, and after a most </p><p>terrific engagement lasting from about </p><p>seven in the morning until two or three </p><p>in the afternoon were relieved by a de- </p><p>tachment from the fort. </p><p> The most amazing part of this fight is</p><p>the fact that the whites lost but three men </p><p>killed and four or five wounded, while the </p><p>Indian loss, as acknowledged some years </p><p>later by Red Cloud, and verified from </p><p>other Indian sources, was 1137. This </p><p>was the first real battle between whites and </p><p>Indians in which breech-loading rifles were </p><p>used by the former against the bows and </p><p>arrows and old-fashioned firearms of the </p><p>savages. </p><p> In anticipation of a battle during the</p><p>process of cutting and transporting logs </p><p>to the fort to finish needed buildings, the </p><p>boxes from fourteen wagons had been </p><p>removed and arranged in a semicircle on </p><p>the level plain a short distance from where </p><p>96 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the wood-choppers were at work, being </p><p>guarded at their task by soldiers from the </p><p>fort. Several extra rifles apiece and ten </p><p>thousand rounds of ammunition were two </p><p>of the reasons for the awful slaughter </p><p>inflicted by the soldiers and wood- </p><p>choppers. On the morning of August 2, </p><p>1807, the wood-choppers were barely at </p><p>their task when Indians by the hundreds </p><p>swarmed from the ravines and gullies </p><p>where the pine logs were being cut. </p><p> Of the number at work, thirty-two man-</p><p>aged to retreat in safety to the wagon-box </p><p>corral, where, under the command of Capt. </p><p>J. W. Powell and Lieut. John -Jenness, </p><p>preparations for a stubborn light were im- </p><p>mediately begun, although their enemies</p><p>outnumbered them nearly a hundred to one. </p><p> Confident of being able to overwhelm</p><p>the little party, Chief Red Cloud devoted </p><p>some little time to preparations for the </p><p>battle. Then a force of five hundred of </p><p>his leading warriors, mounted on their war- </p><p>ponies, detached themselves from the main </p><p>command and started for the little corral </p><p>out on the level plain. Whooping and yell- </p><p>ing, on they came with ponies on the run. </p><p>Not a shot was fired from the corral until </p><p>the horde of screeching savages were within </p><p>fifty yards, when a perfect sheet of flame </p><p>ringed the corral, and a rain of bullets was </p><p>poured into the advancing ranks. </p><p> The firing was not one solid volley and</p><p>then, silence, as the Indians had anticipated, </p><p>but it was a steady and persistent stream </p><p>of fire, which mowed them down in scores. </p><p>The astonished braves could not under- </p><p>stand the rapidity of the firing, knowing </p><p>nothing of the new breech-loading arms </p><p>which had been supplied to the soldiers </p><p>but a very few days before. In the front </p><p>of lhe corral where the brunt of the charge </p><p>had been met, horses and men were cut </p><p>down as by some giant mowing-machine. </p><p> Dazed and chagrined by the failure of</p><p>the first charge, the Sioux fled back out </p><p>of range of those deadly rifles, where Red </p><p>Cloud consulted with other chiefs upon </p><p>another plan. Seven hundred Indians were </p><p>ordered to prepare themselves as a skirmish- </p><p>ing party. They were led by the great </p><p>Red Cloud’s nephew in person. Support- </p><p>ing them and intended to constitute the </p><p>main attack were the w'hole remaining body, </p><p>numbering nearly two thousand warriors. </p><p> In the first attack but one of the whites</p><p>was killed and two severely wounded. </p><p>Again the Indians advanced and again the </p><p>fire belched forth from the corral, mowing </p><p>down the savages in scores. The Indians </p><p>could not account for the sustained and </p><p>frightful fire. </p><p> “The white man must have made bad</p><p>medicine,” they said afterward. </p><p> Charge after charge w-as made on the</p><p>heroic little band huddled within their </p><p>miniature fort, but each w-as successfully </p><p>repulsed. The firing was heard at the </p><p>fort and relief was sent, before wrhich the </p><p>Indians retreated. They had “got enough.” </p><p>Today but three men are known to be </p><p>alive who took part in that most remark- </p><p>able battle. They are Sergt. Sara S. </p><p>Gibson of Omaha, Nebraska, Frederick </p><p>Claus of Lincoln, Nebraska, and M. Litt-</p><p>man of St. Louis. </p><p> Some liistorians have contended that the</p><p>w’agon-boxes were lined with boiler iron, </p><p>which accounted for the small loss suffered </p><p>by the whites, but Sergt. Gibson has in- </p><p>formed the writer that such is not the case. </p><p> “They were the ordinary wagon-boxes</p><p>made out of inch pine boards,” said Gibson. </p><p>“Most of the bullets fired by the Sioux </p><p>splintered the tops of the boxes to slivers, </p><p>but our loss was slight compared to that </p><p>which we inflicted.” </p><p> In reminiscing regarding the Wagon-box</p><p>Fight, about 18S8 on the Pine Ridge reser- </p><p>vation, Chief Red Cloud, then an old man, </p><p>said he went into the fight with over three </p><p>thousand braves and lost over half. He </p><p>was asked if he meant that over fifteen </p><p>hundred were killed. The old chief sorrow- </p><p>fully shook his head and replied: </p><p> “I lost them. They never fought again.”</p><p>Author of “Tfic Vengeance of Rooney,” “An Hour,” etc. </p><p>IT WAS a barbarously decorated big </p><p>room in the casa of Datto Parang. </p><p>The casa stood on the west coast of </p><p>Tawi Tawi, away down under the </p><p>pale rays of the Southern Cross. </p><p> Hanging against the walls of the room on</p><p>all sides were coarse-woven, gorgeously </p><p>colored tapestries, and fastened to them </p><p>were spears, shields, bolos and krises of </p><p>various designs. Also there was a dried </p><p>and shriveled head or two—silent, grue- </p><p>some proof of Parang’s personal prowess as a </p><p>warrior. The furniture consisted of a </p><p>number of chairs made of some hard, red- </p><p>dish wood, crudely but fantastically car- </p><p>ved. In the center of the room was a </p><p>long table of pure ebony, its top polished </p><p>to a mirror finish. At one side of the </p><p>table sat the datto, and opposite him was </p><p>Crawson, white man, renegade, commander- </p><p>in-chief of the datto1 s motley but vicious </p><p>army. </p><p> On the table between them stood a teak-</p><p>wood box which was about ten inches long, </p><p>six by six, bound with heavy iron bands and </p><p>secured with six powerful locks—two on </p><p>either side and one at each end. There </p><p>were also iron rings for handles at each end. </p><p>The box had no hinges. To open it, the </p><p>smooth, snug-fitting lid was merely lifted off </p><p>after all six locks had been unfastened. </p><p> Parang .produced a ring containing six</p><p>keys, unlocked each of the locks, lifted off </p><p>the lid and burrowed his hand, wrist-deep, </p><p>into the contents five hundred thousand </p><p>dollars in jewels. There were diamonds,</p><p>rubies, pearls, emeralds and a plentiful </p><p>mixture of the other and less noted kinds. </p><p>7 </p><p>The datto lifted his hand, palm up, and </p><p>slowly spread his fingers. There followed a </p><p>shower Like the falling of varigated hail, and </p><p>the jewels dropped back into the box, </p><p>scintillating, flashing every color of the </p><p>rainbow. </p><p> Crawson gazed at the little pebbles</p><p>hungrily as they fell through the datto’s </p><p>fingers, sparkling and flashing signals of </p><p>ease, of creature comfort. Five hundred </p><p>thousand dollars in portable, disposable </p><p>form. In Sydney, in Paris, with that box </p><p>—what a life! Crawson had not been in </p><p>Sydney or in Paris, but he had imagination </p><p>and gave it free rein. </p><p> Parang’s small black eyes glowed fanat-</p><p>ically. Here, indeed, was wealth to buy </p><p>many guns and more bullets with which to </p><p>slay the hated Christians. The datto plan- </p><p>ned to unite the entire Moro forces and </p><p>sweep the archipelago from Sulu to Luzon, </p><p>to drive out the Americans and enslave all </p><p>Christian natives. Crawson had made him </p><p>believe it possible. </p><p> In fact, it was Crawson who had origi-</p><p>nated the idea of accumulating a fund to </p><p>buy arms and ammunition. Shortly after he </p><p>had established himself as commander of </p><p>the datto’s army, he laid before the latter his </p><p>plan for a systematic session of looting to </p><p>be perpetrated in Mindanao, the proceeds of </p><p>these incursions to be saved until the sum </p><p>reached a total of five hundred thousand </p><p>dollars. </p><p> “But, sciior” protested the datto, “all of</p><p>the rice and bullocks and potatoes in Tawi </p><p>Tawi and Mindanao put together are not </p><p>worth five hundred thousand dollars.” </p><p>98 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “That's just the trouble with you, Dal to.</p><p>You think only of such cheap trash as rice </p><p>and bullocks and potatoes. Forget that </p><p>stuff and go after the big game. Now, </p><p>these Catholic churches over iu Mindanao </p><p>have gold candlesticks and gold cups they </p><p>call chalices, and the padres have got all </p><p>kinds of gold money and precious stones. </p><p>What we want to do is to rig up some good, </p><p>strong double outriggers that will stand a </p><p>trip from here to the coast of Mindanao, go </p><p>over in small parties and relieve these </p><p>church gentlemen of their wealth. They </p><p>took it from the poor dev ils over there, and </p><p>it’s past time that somebody took it from</p><p>them. </p><p> “And another thing, Datto. Any of these</p><p>filibusters who'll be willing to run guns in </p><p>here to us won't be willing to accept Spanish </p><p>money or gold candlesticks. Either one </p><p>would create suspicion against them. But </p><p>convert everything into jewels—diamonds, </p><p>rubies, pearls and the like—and they’ll take </p><p>those fast enough.” </p><p> The datto had fallen in readily enough</p><p>with both ideas. The outriggers were </p><p>built, and the business of robbing churches </p><p>and almost everything else was promptly </p><p>begun. The results were highly pleasing </p><p>to Crawson and Datto Parang but deeply </p><p>distressing to numerous padres. The hard </p><p>part, however, for Crawson, had been to </p><p>keep Parang from buying guns in small </p><p>quantities and thus preventing the accumu- </p><p>lation from reaching the intended amount. </p><p> But finally he convinced the datto that</p><p>it was safer to take one big chance of landing </p><p>all the guns and ammunition at one time </p><p>than to risk a number of small shipments. </p><p>Thus the wealth now' in hand had reached </p><p>the five-hundred-thousand-dollar mark. </p><p>There was no excuse for further delay. In </p><p>fact, Crawson did not wish to delay any </p><p>longer. The time had come to gather the </p><p>fruit of his labor and his planning. </p><p> The little box had been brought out on</p><p>this particular occasion to put into it more </p><p>gems—the result of the last raid. Craw-son </p><p>drew from his pocket a small leather bag </p><p>•and poured its contents into the box. </p><p>Parang closed and locked it, rose and took </p><p>it into an adjoining room—his owti sleeping- </p><p>apartment. </p><p> Crawson wished that he knew the exact</p><p>hiding-place for the box, but several subtle </p><p>attempts to find out had failed. </p><p> When the datto returned, Crawson looked</p><p>at his watch, pleaded fatigue and said he </p><p>wished to retire for the night. </p><p> As a rule Crawson chose to sleep in his</p><p>tent even when at headquarters. However, </p><p>there w'as always a sleeping-apartment </p><p>ready for him in the datto's casa, and to- </p><p>night he said that he preferred a soft bed. </p><p>So the datto called a slave, who lighted a </p><p>large brass lamp and stood waiting to lead </p><p>the way to Crawson's apartment. </p><p> The white man rose and starLed to follow</p><p>the servant; then he stopped suddenly as if </p><p>he had just thought of something. </p><p> “Ah,” he said, “1 must not forget my</p><p>little courtesy.” </p><p> He opened his cigaret case and studied</p><p>its contents closely for a moment. Then </p><p>he carefully selected a cigaret, placed it be- </p><p>tween the datlo’s lips and held out a lighted </p><p>match. This was a custom which Crawson </p><p>had established early in his associations </p><p>with Datto Parang. </p><p> “It is a token of my loyalty,” he told the</p><p>datto on that first occasion. </p><p> The Mohammedan had been much flat-</p><p>tered, and since that lime they had never </p><p>parted until the little ceremony was per- </p><p>formed. </p><p> When he reached his room, Crawson</p><p>went to bed but not to sleep. He did not </p><p>want to sleep. Besides, his nerves were </p><p>taut, and he fought continually to suppress </p><p>excitement. FinaUy he lit a cigaret. It </p><p>was a native production, and he threw it </p><p>away in disgust, found a brown paper and </p><p>some American tobacco and rolled a </p><p>smoke. Then he settled back and in the </p><p>pages of a six-months-old magazine tried </p><p>to forget the passing of time. Nevertheless, </p><p>he looked at his watch often, and at last the </p><p>hands pointed to one o’clock. He judged </p><p>that the time for his work had arrived. </p><p> He arose, dressed in an outfit of native</p><p>clothes instead of his uniform and buckled </p><p>about his w^aist a belt to which hung two </p><p>large revolvers and one small kris. The </p><p>belt contained one hundred cartridges. </p><p>Crawson made his way without a sound </p><p>back to the big room and with his left </p><p>hand gently tried the door to Parang’s </p><p>bedroom while his right hand gripped the </p><p>hilt of the small kris. He was not sure that </p><p>Parang was asleep, and. in case he was dis- </p><p>covered, a pistol-shot was out of the </p><p>question. </p><p> Crawson found that the door w-as fastened</p><p>on the inside. He waited breathlessly, his </p><p>Rescued </p><p>99 </p><p> ears strained for a sound. He could</p><p> hear his watch tick off the seconds. A</p><p> minute passed; no sound came. Then he</p><p> carefully stuck the kris through the split-</p><p> wattled door just below the wooden latch</p><p> which fastened it on the inside. Next he</p><p> • pressed down on the handle of the kris, thus</p><p> lifting the latch with the blade. The</p><p> door opened readily, and Crawson stepped</p><p> in.</p><p> ’ A lamp was still burning. Parang was</p><p> stretched on his bed crosswise, dead for the</p><p> time being, his clothes still on. Crawson’s</p><p> cigaret had fulfilled its purpose. Another</p><p> detail of his plan had worked out as cal-</p><p> culated. This was encouragement.</p><p> The next step was to find the teak-wood</p><p> box. He looked about the room. The</p><p> box was not in sight. The walls of the</p><p> house were split-wattled bamboo and</p><p> thatched on the outside; there was no</p><p> chance of its being hidden there. A thor-</p><p> ough investigation of the furniture re-</p><p> vealed nothing, and Crawson grew anxious.</p><p> That the treasure was somewhere in the</p><p> room, he was positive, for more than once he</p><p> had seen Parang carry it there. And he</p><p> knew that the datto was too well acquainted</p><p> with Moro nature to have intrusted the box</p><p> to any one.</p><p> Still, apparently, his search had already</p><p> eliminated every possible hiding-place.</p><p> No; there was one other. Happy thought.</p><p> Why had it taken so long to come?</p><p> On his hands and knees Crawson began</p><p> going over the floor. At last he moved the</p><p> foot-mat beside Parang’s bed, and there his</p><p> search ended. A square panel had been</p><p> cut out of the floor and a sort of trap-door</p><p> made. Crawson raised the door, lifted</p><p> out the box and started to leave the room.</p><p> Then he thought of the six keys. He</p><p> found them in the pocket of Parang’s tunic.</p><p> OUTSIDE of the casa Crawson</p><p> walked to a small, shabby tent and</p><p> _ rapped on the closed flap. A few</p><p> seconds passed, and then two husky Moros</p><p> emerged from the tent and saluted in soldier</p><p> fashion, their bare, bronze shoulders glist-</p><p> ening under the full moon. These were the</p><p> white man’s personal servants.</p><p> “Chow,” ordered Crawson. "Enough</p><p> for two days.”</p><p> The two servants were accustomed to</p><p> sudden trips started in the middle of the</p><p> night. They were used to the demand for</p><p>chow and were always prepared to produce </p><p>it quickly. Silently the two disappeared </p><p>and in a few minutes returned with food for </p><p>a two days7 journey. </p><p> “To the boats pronto,” Crawson ordered</p><p>and fell in behind them. </p><p> At the beach Crawson pointed to a large</p><p>outrigger. The Moros clambered aboard </p><p>and took their places at the oars. The </p><p>white man followed, and, as he seated him- </p><p>self in the stern of the boat, he saw one of </p><p>the Moros make a slight gesture toward the </p><p>box. Also, he noted that tjie two were </p><p>whispering furtively to each other. He </p><p>wondered if some rumor of the box and its </p><p>treasure had reached them. It was pos- </p><p>sible. Yes, even probable. Secrets were</p><p>hard to keep. At any rate, it was plain that </p><p>his servants were suspicious, and Crawson </p><p>decided that the sooner he asserted himself </p><p>the better. He whipped out one of his </p><p>revolvers and said curtly: </p><p> “I’m leaving this-country of yours,</p><p>and you two may as well know it now as any </p><p>time. Shove off, and the first one that </p><p>makes a sound is meat for the sharks.” </p><p> For half an hour the men rowed vigor-</p><p>ously under the stimulus of the white man’s </p><p>gun. Then he ordered a halt and called </p><p>one of them over to him. </p><p> “Take off that bolo,” he said, “and throw</p><p>it into the sea. Now, have you got any </p><p>more knives stored away about you?” </p><p> “No, senor,” answered the Moro.</p><p> “Turn your back,” said Crawson, “and</p><p>I’ll soon find out.” </p><p> When the man’s back was turned, Craw-</p><p>son pressed the muzzle of his revolver </p><p>against the brown neck just below the ear </p><p>and with his left hand felt around the waist- </p><p>band of the fellow’s breech-clout and </p><p>brought out a wavey little double-edged </p><p>kris. </p><p> “I thought so,” said the white man and</p><p>threw the thing overboard after its larger </p><p>brother. </p><p> “Now, go back and take your place at the</p><p>oar,” he ordered. </p><p> When the first servant was seated, Craw-</p><p>son called the other one over and searched </p><p>him also. </p><p> “Now,” said Crawson, “if I turn my back</p><p>for the fifth part of a second, you hombres </p><p>won’t be able to whiz a knife into me. And </p><p>don’t forget to put some muscle behind </p><p>them oars. If you do, I might get careless </p><p>with these six-shooters.” </p><p>IOO </p><p>Adventure </p><p> After that he settled back to guard the</p><p>two men who were sending the boat north- </p><p>ward with long, sweeping strokes. </p><p> It was a trip of about one hundred and</p><p>ninety miJes that Crawson was intending </p><p>to make, and he figured that he could force </p><p>the two Moros to row that distance in </p><p>seventy-two hours. He had planned to </p><p>run north from Tawi Tawi until he passed </p><p>Zamboanga City, which is at the southern </p><p>end of the Zamboanga Peninsula. </p><p> Then he proposed to change his course</p><p>east and pick up the coast of Mindanao off </p><p>San Ramon, which is about twenty miles </p><p>north of Zamboanga City. Here he would </p><p>land among the peaceable Subanos, where</p><p>there were no Moros and where he was </p><p>reasonably sure there would be no troops. </p><p>He could not afford to meet any soldiers—or </p><p>any white people at all, for that matter. </p><p>He did not know just how much the author- </p><p>ities knew about his raids in Mindanao or </p><p>just how badly he might be wanted. </p><p> After landing he intended to go into the</p><p>jungle near San Ramon, tie the Moros hand </p><p>and foot and hold them prisoners. There </p><p>in the jungle he would remain until he </p><p>could learn of some steamer that was </p><p>sailing from Zamboanga to Australia. </p><p>Then he would turn his prisoners loose at </p><p>the last minute, slip down in the night and </p><p>get aboard the ship. And the new life </p><p>would begin. </p><p> It was a clear night. The moon silvered</p><p>the smooth, green water, and the arms of </p><p>the outrigger hissed as they skimmed </p><p>lightly along the surface. </p><p> With his gun in his right hand and the</p><p>tiller in his left, Crawson held his boat to the </p><p>north. Far astern of him, low in the sky, </p><p>hung the Southern Cross, symbolic of the </p><p>tropics, of adventure. At his feet lay five </p><p>hundred thousand dollars—not in humdrum, </p><p>commonplace money but in clean, pulse- </p><p>stirring jewels. The blood coursed hotly </p><p>through his veins. He felt the thrill of </p><p>lawlessness—of piracy. He had defied all </p><p>conventions, alJ law. He liad set aside all </p><p>scruples and taken for himself what he </p><p>wanted out of the wealth of the world. </p><p>And now he rode, a very monarch on the </p><p>broad sea, forcing by sheer power two hu- </p><p>man beings to do his absolute will. Thus in </p><p>exhilaration of possession, Crawson coaxed </p><p>and threatened and drove the Moros on to </p><p>greater effort. He knew that daylight </p><p>would bring discovery and that the land </p><p>and the sea would then be searched in all </p><p>directions. </p><p> The precious hours from 2:30—the time</p><p>when Crawson left the beach—till daylight </p><p>sped id1 too swiftly. When day dawned, </p><p>the two Moros were extremely tired, and </p><p>Crawson’s direst threats, accompanied by </p><p>an occasional blow, failed to speed up the </p><p>swing of their oars. To make the prospect </p><p>less rosy, black clouds were gathering in the </p><p>heavens and the wind was steadily increas-' </p><p>ing. About eleven o’clock in the morning </p><p>Crawson saw two outriggers rise on the </p><p>crest of a long sw-ell well astern of him. </p><p>There were at least a dozen men in each of </p><p>the boats. Crawson had expected to be </p><p>pursued, but he hardly thought they would</p><p>have overtaken him so soon. At first he </p><p>was inclined to doubt that they were pur- </p><p>suers. But any question as to who they </p><p>were was promptly settled by a puff of </p><p>w'hite smoke which rose from one of the </p><p>oncoming boats and a Mauser bullet which </p><p>came whining across the water. </p><p> Crawson knew that it was no miracle</p><p>that the Moros should have picked up his </p><p>course so easily. Had he gone in any other </p><p>direction, they would have sighted him just </p><p>as quickly. For these were only two of a </p><p>dozen boats sent out in fan-shape formation </p><p>so as to cover the entire surface for miles </p><p>around. The wrhite man now prayed for </p><p>the storm which he had so recently dreaded; </p><p>it would at least put an end to the firing and </p><p>perhaps give him a chance to elude the </p><p>A loros. </p><p> The pursuers wrere pulling nowr with all</p><p>their might, and with the strength of their </p><p>many oars they were gaining fast. It </p><p>seemed but a question of time until the </p><p>erstwhile general would be overhauled and </p><p>taken prisoner or else shot by his own sol- </p><p>diers. Crawson realized that he must do </p><p>some tiling—that in some wav he must </p><p>drive the two men in his owti boat on to </p><p>greater effort. He fired two shots in quick </p><p>succession into the gunwales of the boat, </p><p>one shot at the elbow of each of the Moros. </p><p> “Pull!” he shouted. “Pull! Or the next</p><p>will lodge in your hides." </p><p>THE terror of the shots and the </p><p>fierceness of Crawson’s voice sent </p><p>fear to their hearts; they forgot </p><p>their fatigue, leaned far forward and then </p><p>bent their oars with long backward sweeps. </p><p>The boat shot out with doubled speed, and </p><p>Rescued </p><p>IOI </p><p>the pursuers ceased to gain for a short time. </p><p>But the exertion that Crawson’s men had </p><p>been driven to was short-lived; it was be- </p><p>yond their powers to keep it up. </p><p> In the meantime the waves were rapidly</p><p>rising, for the wind, which had been blowing </p><p>briskly from the northwest, suddenly shifted </p><p>to the southwest with increased force. </p><p>And now, instead of being compelled to </p><p>pull partly against the wind, Crawson had </p><p>both wind and water at his back driving </p><p>him along his proper course faster than </p><p>twenty oars could have done. But the </p><p>same wind which drove his boat up the </p><p>watery mountains and down across the </p><p>seething valleys did the same for his pur- </p><p>suers. Nevertheless, Crawson welcomed</p><p>the storm, which by now had turned the </p><p>sky to a black shroud and the sea to a </p><p>roaring, tearing monster. </p><p> By this time the two oarsmen had let</p><p>their oars go and turned all their attention </p><p>to the business of staying in the boat. And </p><p>the little box was bouncing around in a way </p><p>that was alarming. Crawson sheathed </p><p>his revolver—there was no danger from his </p><p>servants just then—and knelt astride the til- </p><p>ler, thus holding the boat on its course. </p><p>Then he felt under the seat and found a </p><p>short coil of rope. This he ran through the </p><p>iron handles of the box and bound it to his </p><p>shoulders. </p><p> Often now, as the frail craft scurried up</p><p>the. green wall of some gigantic billow, </p><p>Crawson felt sure that it would pitch </p><p>backward, bottom up, and be crushed by </p><p>the great rolling mass of water immediately </p><p>behind. Still the boat continued to climb </p><p>up the sheer, green banks, its arms out- </p><p>spread like some monstrous spider, and </p><p>Crawson would lean to the bottom lest he </p><p>fall out backward. </p><p> Then, when the little shell would shoot</p><p>over a curving ridge and cling there for a </p><p>breathless second, Crawson was transported </p><p>to raptures. In those few brief moments </p><p>he would live ages at the pinnacle of life. </p><p>And yet again, as the stinging salt spray </p><p>whipped his face and the boat raced down </p><p>at a speed which no engine could propel and </p><p>the combing crests of the waves lapped out </p><p>at him like hungry tongues, Crawson </p><p>shouted in joy and defiance at the wild, </p><p>whirling elements about him. But through </p><p>it all he never forgot to use his tiller. With </p><p>that he kept the stern of his boat to the </p><p>wind—kept it from turning broadside and </p><p>being swamped. It was a glorious battle, </p><p>the pigmy man outwitting and overriding </p><p>limitless power. </p><p> So filled was Crawson’s mind with sen-</p><p>sations that he had forgotten he was not </p><p>alone until reminded by the sight of his two </p><p>servants diving overboard. He realized </p><p>that only some imminent danger could have </p><p>driven them to leave the boat and brave </p><p>such a boiling tumult. So he began </p><p>scanning the horizon as closely as possi- </p><p>ble for an explanation of this sudden rash- </p><p>ness. </p><p> First he eyed the boat up and down for a</p><p>leak, but there was none. There was no </p><p>water in the bottom to speak of—merely </p><p>what had splashed aboard in the form of </p><p>spray \ the little craft was riding the waves</p><p>buoy antly. At that instant the boat was </p><p>on the crest of a towering billow, and Craw- </p><p>son was in a position to see much of the </p><p>watery^ space about him, but the two ser- </p><p>vants were not in sight. Doubtless they </p><p>had been carried down. </p><p> From the elevation of its position the</p><p>little craft dived to the seemingly bottom- </p><p>less depth of a watery chasm. Then on </p><p>the crest of the next wave Crawson learned </p><p>why his oarsmen had chosen to go over- </p><p>board. Scarcely had he seen it when his </p><p>boat, rushing down the opposite side of the </p><p>great wave with a scud-driving speed, </p><p>crashed upon the reef and shattered to </p><p>splinters. The Moros had feared this </p><p>more than the raging water. </p><p> There was a swirl of water about Craw-</p><p>son’s ears, an impression of tangled rafts </p><p>of kindling wood, and then he found himself </p><p>clinging to the reef, although the sharp </p><p>coral cut his hands terribly. Instinctively', </p><p>half-consciously, he freed one hand and </p><p>reached up to his shoulder. The box was </p><p>still there, intact. </p><p> Taking conditions as they were, the thing</p><p>of most and immediate importance was to </p><p>find some sort of shelter from the tremen- </p><p>dous weight of onrushing water. Unless he </p><p>did this, Crawson knew that he would soon </p><p>be beaten insensible. He dragged himself </p><p>up and crawled slowly over the reef, </p><p>holding grimly with hands and feet to the </p><p>irregular surface to brace his body against </p><p>the ever-surging water. Thus he worked </p><p>his way slowly and painfully to the western </p><p>edge of the reef. Once there, he crawled </p><p>down the rough side and found a ledge that </p><p>afforded him a foothold. The ledge was </p><p> 1</p><p>102	Adventure</p><p>several feet below the surface. And, stand- </p><p>ing on this with more than half of his body </p><p>under water and clinging to the edge of the </p><p>reef with both hands, he was partially pro- </p><p>tected from the storm-driven water which </p><p>broke and spent most of its force on the </p><p>opposite side. </p><p> Crawson remained clinging here for what</p><p>seemed to him an unendurable length of </p><p>time. His shoulders ached from the weight </p><p>of the box, which had become to him not a </p><p>thing of pounds but of tons. His fingers </p><p>were cramped and bleeding from holding to </p><p>the ledge, and he felt that he had been hold- </p><p>ing on there since the first ray of the first </p><p>dawn. But in reality it was less than an</p><p>hour, for the storm broke quickly, as they </p><p>so often do in tropical waters. The clouds </p><p>melted, and the siui shone forth, dazzling, </p><p>searing. </p><p> As soon as the commotion of the water</p><p>began to subside, Crawson left his perch </p><p>on the ledge and drew himself up to the </p><p>surface of the reef. The seas were still </p><p>running high, but the force was no longer </p><p>behind them. Crawson was able to stand </p><p>up and survey his surroundings. </p><p>H ALMOST the first thing he saw was </p><p>a 1owt, flat speck of land. It was a </p><p>mere dot on the face of Lhe ocean. </p><p>He could see across it. There were no </p><p>inhabitants, no growth—just a bare, bald </p><p>sand-dune with a rocky formation at one </p><p>end, completely surrounded by a coral </p><p>reef. Yet to Crawson it was a paradise, </p><p>an oasis in the desert. He judged the </p><p>island to be about a mile from the reef, and </p><p>even in his present condition he felt equal </p><p>to a swim of that distance. </p><p> The seas were fast getting down to nor-</p><p>mal. Crawson scanned the horizon in </p><p>search of the Moros. They were not to be </p><p>seen. The white man was glad for this. </p><p>He might be able to swim a mile, but he </p><p>was in no shape for an encounter with a </p><p>gang of Moros. Moreover, he had no </p><p>weapon except his two hands with which to </p><p>defend himself. When his boat had been </p><p>wrecked, his belt was torn off in some way, </p><p>and with it went his dagger, his revolvers </p><p>and ammunition. </p><p> Crawson sat down and took off his shoes</p><p>and trousers, Lied the shoes together and </p><p>swung them over his neck, stuffed the trousers </p><p>in between his back and the jewel box, </p><p>slipped into the water and struck out for </p><p>the island with a long, steady stroke that he </p><p>knew- he would be able to maintain. </p><p> As soon as he reached the island, which</p><p>he judged to be about five miles in circum- </p><p>ference, Crawson began going over it in the </p><p>hope of finding fresh water. But, much to </p><p>his dismay, there was not a drop to be </p><p>found. But he did come upon numerous </p><p>birds. Some of the more timid ones flew a </p><p>little away at his approach, but most of </p><p>them merely waddled to one side as he </p><p>came near. He recognized them for gun- </p><p>nies and terns, and by the great quantities </p><p>of eggs strewn on the sand he knew they </p><p>were there for the purpose of breeding. </p><p>This, then, solved the problem of food. </p><p>However, Crawson’s thirst was greater </p><p>than his hunger just then; so he determined</p><p>to look again for water before trying Lhe </p><p>eggs. </p><p> While pursuing his search for water,</p><p>Crawson discovered the hull of an old </p><p>wreck, a small sailing craft. It was piled </p><p>on the beach and half buried in the sand, </p><p>indicating that it had been wrecked years </p><p>before. He ripped an oaken plank from the </p><p>side of the old hull, broke it at a convenient </p><p>length, w’ent back about two hundred yards </p><p>from the beach and began to dig. He had </p><p>expected that he would have to try in many </p><p>places, but to his surprize water began to </p><p>bubble up through the sand when he had </p><p>dug down less than five feet. </p><p> Crawson cupped his hands and tasted it.</p><p>It was cool and fresh—not the slightest </p><p>tinge of salt. He thought it a miracle that </p><p>he had struck water al the first place he </p><p>tried. Later he w'as to learn that he could </p><p>strike water anywhere on the island as soon </p><p>as he dug down to the level of the ocean’s </p><p>surface. It was merely the ocean water </p><p>that seeped through the sand and was fil- </p><p>tered in the process. </p><p> When Crawson had slaked his thirst at</p><p>the little well of his own making, his incen- </p><p>tive for further exertion was removed. </p><p>For the present, at least, his hunger was </p><p>forgotten in the crying need of his body— </p><p>his entire body from molecule to muscle— </p><p>for relaxation, rest. </p><p> The ancient schooner had come on to the</p><p>beach at the north side of the island with its </p><p>nose pointing southward. Therefore, as </p><p>the time was afternoon, the western side of </p><p>it offered a small space of shade. Crawson </p><p>strelched out in the coolness of this spot </p><p>and gave himself up to slumber—that </p><p>Rescued </p><p>103 </p><p>slumber which is absolute oblivion the </p><p>oblivion that comes to the utterly ex- </p><p>hausted. </p><p> Crawson was aroused some hours later</p><p>by the lapping of cool water about his body. </p><p>The waves had actually reached the height </p><p>of his neck. It was high tide. He crawled </p><p>out of the thin sheet of rising and receding </p><p>water and stood up, once more fresh, in- </p><p>vigorated, hungry, ready for the eggs. </p><p> He scooped out a slight depression in the</p><p>sand, placed in it half a dozen eggs and </p><p>covered them with more sand. Then he </p><p>ripped a plank from the old wreck and with </p><p>a heavy chunk of coral broke it into fine </p><p>splinters and piled them over the eggs </p><p>ready to fire. But, when he drew' from his</p><p>pocket a supposedly w’aterproof match-box, </p><p>he found that his matches were totally </p><p>dissolved by water. However, this did not </p><p>daunt Crawson, nor did he mean that he </p><p>would eat his eggs raw. He looked around </p><p>for a w'hile and found some dry grass, a few </p><p>scrawny turfs of which grew on the island. </p><p>He took some of the grass between his </p><p>hands and ground it into fine chaff. Then </p><p>over the chaff he held two stones and struck </p><p>them together. A spark fell; the chaff </p><p>ignited. This he set to the splinters, and </p><p>soon the eggs were roasted. </p><p> When Crawson finished eating, it was</p><p>about an hour before sunset, and the day </p><p>was exceptionally clear. Looking off to the </p><p>east, in the hazy distance he could distin- </p><p>guish the dim shape of a great mountain. </p><p>This, he knew, was on the Island of Jolo; </p><p>no other island so near lifted its peak to </p><p>that height. And by his proximity to Jolo </p><p>Crawson knew that he was marooned on </p><p>one of the many nameless, uncharted islands </p><p>that are a part of the Sulu Archipelago. </p><p> To the west of him he could see another</p><p>island, which was, apparently, about five </p><p>miles away. This island was larger and had </p><p>a much greater elevation than the one on </p><p>which he was located. Also, it appeared to </p><p>have a considerable growth of coco-palms. </p><p>These trees interested Crawson a great deal. </p><p>If he could only get to the other island, he </p><p>would find some way of making these tall, </p><p>straight spires into a raft. He knew that </p><p>ships never came into that labyrinth of </p><p>coral reefs; so his one hope of getting to the </p><p>mainland was a raft of some sort. </p><p> At first Crawson had thought to con-</p><p>struct a raft out of timber from the old </p><p>wreck, but half an hour's consideration of </p><p>this project proved it impractical. Any </p><p>raft that he could rig out with boards and </p><p>cross-beams would be too light and too frail </p><p>for a hundred-mile sea voyage. On the </p><p>other hand, a raft of heavy logs would not </p><p>be so easily capsized. </p><p> As Crawson sat thinking these things</p><p>over, twilight effaced the gold of the sunset; </p><p>a myriad stars dotted the sky; cold, pale </p><p>moonbeams fell like shattered lances on the </p><p>dark bosom of the ocean; a mating bird </p><p>called sleepily to its loved one, and the </p><p>sound blended and harmonized with the </p><p>dull boom of the waves on the distant reef. </p><p>Then at last the castaway, lulled by the </p><p>balmy, salt air, threw aside his problems </p><p>and fell asleep. </p><p> Crawson spent the next morning working</p><p>the roof off the galley of the old hull. He </p><p>had nothing but a chunk of coral and a </p><p>length of cross-beam to work with, and it </p><p>was a tedious job. But he finally pried the </p><p>thing off in good condition. It made a </p><p>flimsy raft, one that he would never dare the </p><p>sea with, but he thought he could get to </p><p>the other island on it. However, he de- </p><p>cided not to make the trip for several days </p><p>to come. If there were any Moros—his </p><p>late pursuers—marooned over there, they </p><p>would probably rig up a raft and either </p><p>start for Tawi Tawi or come looking for </p><p>him in the next day or two. </p><p>IT WAS noon when Crawson com- </p><p>pleted his task with the galley roof, </p><p>and he was again hungry. He </p><p>roasted more eggs and w^as much annoyed to </p><p>find, upon peeling the shells off, that two of </p><p>them were exceedingly strong and that one </p><p>had in it a half-hatched bird. He was al- </p><p>ready beginning to feel the w-ant of variety </p><p>in food, and the sight of a half-hatched bird </p><p>in his dinner did not increase his relish for </p><p>a straight egg diet. Crawson determined </p><p>that it should not happen again. He found </p><p>a piece of board, the one he had used to dig </p><p>the well, and with it drew’ a large circle in </p><p>the sand and moved every egg out of the </p><p>circle. He knew then that the eggs he </p><p>would find in this circle for the next few </p><p>days would be fresh. </p><p> Three days passed. No Moros showed,</p><p>and Crawson decided that he wTould risk a </p><p>trip to the other island. He buried his box </p><p>of jewels deep under the lee of the old hulL </p><p>If the Moros were on the other island, he </p><p>had no intention of carrying the treasure </p><p>104 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>over to them. Then, when the tide came in </p><p>and washed away all traces of his digging, he </p><p>rolled his clothes into a small bundle, made </p><p>them secure on the raft, took a board of con- </p><p>venient length and rowed out to a gap in </p><p>the reef, worked his raft through and started </p><p>on liis perilous voyage. </p><p> He had not gone far before he noticed a</p><p>single sharp fin about two inches above the </p><p>water. Crawson did not need to look to </p><p>know what was beneath the fin; it was a </p><p>long, gray cigar-shaped thing—a man- </p><p>eater—slinking along with ghoulish stealth </p><p>just across from the little raft. Crawson </p><p>slapped the water loudly with the llat of his </p><p>paddle, and for a few minutes the fin disap- </p><p>peared. But soon it was back again, </p><p>slinking along even closer than before.</p><p>And so the man rowed on, and so the silent, </p><p>gray ghoul dogged his course. That the </p><p>shark might attack Crawson on his flimsy </p><p>raft was not altogether improbable, and, if </p><p>it did, the result was certain—the raft </p><p>upset, a flash of red jaws, of gleaming teeth </p><p>and—the end. But this ever present pos- </p><p>sibility did not greatly worry Crawson; </p><p>rather, it made the situation interesting— </p><p>added zest to existence. </p><p> After about three hours the raft crossed a</p><p>slightly submerged reef, and the shark disap- </p><p>peared. A little more and Crawson landed. </p><p>A few minutes proved that there were no </p><p>Moros on the island. It was not a sand </p><p>formation like the island he had just left, </p><p>but one of those humps of earth that have </p><p>been pushed up above water surface by </p><p>some subterianean upheaval. Having been </p><p>raised from the bed of the ocean, the island </p><p>was fertile and its foliage rank. There </p><p>were coconuts and bananas and nipa in </p><p>abundance. Also, Crawson found a spring </p><p>of clear, fresh water bubbling through a </p><p>crevice in the side of a rock-walled cliff. </p><p>After allowing himself the luxury of half a </p><p>dozen bananas and the milk from two half- </p><p>grown coconuts, he set about the work of </p><p>constructing a raft. </p><p> First he gathered nipa and plaited it into</p><p>ihree-ply strands of about forty feet each. </p><p>These he tied from tree to tree, stretching </p><p>them tight and leaving them to dry. </p><p>Bundle alter bundle he plaited, and strand </p><p>after strand he stretched among the trees, </p><p>till he had more than twelve hundred feet of </p><p>nipa rope. This work occupied the best </p><p>part of ten days, and, when it was finished, </p><p>his next item was logs. </p><p> Crawson had no tool to cut down and</p><p>trim trees; so he searched out fallen logs— </p><p>not rotten ones, but sound ones blown down </p><p>by typhoons Naturally, these logs were of </p><p>various lengths, and, tt/get them all of one </p><p>length, he rolled and dragged them to- </p><p>gether, side by side, the butt ends even. </p><p>Then he brought dry grass and branches </p><p>and built a fire across the logs where it </p><p>would bum them off evenly and at a proper </p><p>length. Then, laying them in two tiers, </p><p>crosswise, and using the grass rope for </p><p>laslung, he soon completed a much-roped </p><p>and fairly durable raft. </p><p> Out of some small boughs and vines Craw-</p><p>son constructed a sort of bin at the front </p><p>end of tlie raft, and this he filled with coco- </p><p>nuts, the milk of which would take the </p><p>place of water on the voyage. Building</p><p>the raft had taken altogether fifteen day's, </p><p>and during that time Crawson had eaten </p><p>nothing but coconuts and bananas. So </p><p>he was glad to set out for the sand island </p><p>again, where he could eat eggs. </p><p> Crawson started about ten o’clock in the</p><p>morning, but his raft was heavy, broad- </p><p>ended and consequently hard to row. He </p><p>was all day covering the five or six miles </p><p>between the Islands. </p><p> Shortly before sundown he made his raft</p><p>fast to the old wreck and immediately began </p><p>digging to see whether his treasure was still </p><p>safe. He had spent some anxious nights </p><p>about that, but now he found it just as he </p><p>had left it. So he roasted himself a meal of </p><p>eggs and then placed several dozen more </p><p>under a large fire and left them to roast </p><p>during the night. These were for th* </p><p>voyage. </p><p>THE next morning Crawson started </p><p>on his voyage to the small coast </p><p>town of San Ramon. For eight </p><p>days Crawson rowed diligently, stopping to </p><p>snatch a few hours of sleep only when </p><p>nature became too insistent to be denied. </p><p>The end of the eighth day found him in a </p><p>bad way, indeed. For three days he had </p><p>not seen sun, moon or stars. He had com- </p><p>pletely lost all idea of direction. Day and </p><p>night, hour and minute, he dwelt on the </p><p>probability of his location. Where was he? </p><p>Was he going toward San Ramon or out to </p><p>sea? These questions reiterated them- </p><p>selves again and again. They preyed on </p><p>his nerves. Panic seized him. His muscles </p><p>were stiff and sore from rowing and his </p><p>Day-Dreams </p><p>105 </p><p>hands blistered. His mind was on the verge of </p><p>dissolution. Then, at last, nature came to </p><p>his relief, and Crawson slept. </p><p> There was a whistle, shrill, metallic. It</p><p>seemed faintly to pierce dim, invisible walls </p><p>wherein Crawson was confined. The whistle </p><p>died out, but the walls had been pierced. </p><p>There came the clang of bells. Crawson had </p><p>heard bells like that before. Where? Oh, yes, </p><p>to be sure—in the engine-room on a ship. </p><p>That’s where he had heard those bells. </p><p>They were signals to the engineer. </p><p> The invisible walls around Crawson were</p><p>shattered. He now heard clearly. A voice </p><p>of authority was giving commands. But </p><p>where was he, Crawson? Where had he </p><p>come from? How had he come to be here </p><p>so close to a ship and yet not on the ship? </p><p>He opened his eyes. A long blade of light</p><p>slanted down on him and revealed his raft </p><p>of logs, coconuts piled at one end and water </p><p>all about. Ah, yes, he knew then. He had </p><p>been lost at sea on a raft. He had fallen </p><p>asleep, and this was a ship come to rescue </p><p>him. At last he would get off of the raft </p><p>and feel the comfort and certainty of know- </p><p>ing where he was. </p><p> The life-boat was alongside of his raft.</p><p>Crawson’s jewel box, as usual, was roped to </p><p>his shoulders. He scrambled to his hands </p><p>and knees and crawled stiffly to the edge of </p><p>the raft. He was weak, exhausted. The </p><p>sailors helped him gently into their boat and </p><p>then aboard the ship. </p><p> Hours later Crawson awoke in a bunk in</p><p>the forecastle. He moved, and there was a </p><p>clank of chains. His wrists and his ankles </p><p>were in irons. Crawson held up his man- </p><p>acled hands and demanded of the sailor </p><p>across from him: </p><p> “WTiat the-does this mean?”</p><p> “It means that the skipper’s had a look</p><p>into that little teak-wood box,” responded </p><p>the sailor, '‘and he’s decided that you’re </p><p>Crawson, the fellow who’s been leadin’ </p><p>Moros and lootin’ down around Zambo- </p><p>anga.” </p><p> “What right has this skipper got to be</p><p>nosing into my belongings?” snarled Craw- </p><p>son. </p><p> “Say, son,” grinned the other. “You’re</p><p>aboard of a United States revenue cutter.” </p><p>Crawson turned his back to the sailor. </p><p>There was nothing more to be said. </p><p> DAY-DREAM S</p><p> BY £.

The white blanket </p><p>that covered Little Brother Moun- </p><p>tain and Big Brother Mountain — </p><p>and the broad and thickly wooded valley </p><p>that lay between them—was five inches </p><p>deep. In the center of the valley Big </p><p>Brother Creek flowed merrily, passing the </p><p>Morgan-Haley Lumber Company’s logging </p><p>outfit and pouring its crystal waters into </p><p>Laurel River some four miles below. </p><p> Night had come. Supper was over at the</p><p>Morgan-Haley camp, and the majority </p><p>of the timberjacks had deserted the big </p><p>and rough boarding-house for the commis- </p><p>sary’s glowing cast-iron stove. These were </p><p>stalwart and sunburned fellows, all moun- </p><p>taineers and all dressed alike in laced boots </p><p>and broad hats, blue flannel shirts and clay- </p><p>colored corduroys. </p><p> Gideon Ashford, a big logger whose beard</p><p>was so black that his freshly-shaven face </p><p>had a bluish look, had just begun a harangue, </p><p>setting forth in his uncouth way the extraor- </p><p>dinary beauty of one Miss Nancy Kirk- </p><p>land, when an interrupting voice came from </p><p>the other side of the red-hot stove. </p><p> “Shet up!” with an icy snap. “When ye</p><p>ain’t got nothin‘■to say, say it!” </p><p> “Humph!” grunted the impudent Ash-</p><p>ford. He was the bully and smart Aleck </p><p>of the camp. “Is that you, 'Lonesome? </p><p>Why, I thought ye was asleep. It’s got to </p><p>be that ye’re real sassy when ‘Howlin’ </p><p>Jim’ ain’t around to keep ye quiet. Fust </p><p>thing ye know, ye’ll have some trouble, </p><p>Lonesome, a-tellin’ grown folks to shet up </p><p>thatawayl” </p><p> His words carried a bite. The man called</p><p>“Lonesome” sat on a soap box with his lees </p><p>crossed and with his forearms resting on his </p><p>upper knee. He was a tall and rangey </p><p>young man, as hard as hickory and as lithe </p><p>as a panther and remarkably taciturn at </p><p>times—which, of course, had bred for him </p><p>his nickname. For six months he had been </p><p>with the Morgan-Haley crew, and still no- </p><p>body seemed to know any tiling about him </p><p>save Howling Jim Baskin—unless it was old </p><p>Nathan Kirkland’s daughter, Nancy. </p><p> Howling Jim—he had a voice that would</p><p>have made a fog-horn blush, and he used it </p><p>at every decent opportunity—had come to </p><p>the camp on Big Brother Creek with Lone- </p><p>some Bentley. He was at least thirty-five, </p><p>and ten years older than Bentley. But </p><p>theirs had been a wonderfully tight friend-</p><p>ship for all of that. </p><p> Lonesome did not favor Ashford with a</p><p>reply. A few of the onlooking timberjacks </p><p>snickered, because they didn’t know what </p><p>else to do. Ashford laughed outright at </p><p>that which he was pleased to think of as </p><p>the other’s discomfiture. Just then there </p><p>came to the ears of those in the commissary </p><p>a snatch of a foolish old song in the ringing </p><p>voice of Howling Jim, who was leaving the </p><p>boarding-house for the big stove. </p><p>“I’m a-goin’ to live, anyhow, till I die— </p><p>Anyhow, anyhow, till I die!” </p><p> “Howlin’s a-comin!,” grinned Ashford.</p><p>“I reckon ye’ll behave yerself now, Lone- </p><p>some.” </p><p>Bentley stuck fast to his motto, “When </p><p>ye ain’t got nothin’ to say, say it,” and was </p><p>Howling Jim’s Pal </p><p>107 </p><p>silent. As Baskin stepped into the com- </p><p>missary' doorway, he shook the snow from </p><p>his hat, his broad shoulders and his boots. </p><p> “Hi, men! Good evenin’ to ye! Any-</p><p>body seed anything o’ Lonesome?'’ he shot </p><p>all in one breath at the crowd by the stove. </p><p> “Here,” the bully answered in tones</p><p>colored with ridicule, pointing. </p><p> Baskin closed the door behind him,</p><p>walked smilingly over and halted beside </p><p>his pal. Something was wrong, he saw at </p><p>once. Then he caught sight of the still </p><p>leering face of the bully, and he understood. </p><p>He stepped toward Ashford, folded his </p><p>arms across his chest and looked Ashford </p><p>straight in the eye. </p><p> “All right, Gid,” he said narrowly;</p><p>“keep it up. You’ll git yores, all right, ef </p><p>ye’ll jest keep it up. It won’t be me that </p><p>hands it to ye, neither; it’ll be Lonesome </p><p>hisself. ■ He shore carries a su’prize package </p><p>in each paw, and he'll lay a wallopin’ on ye </p><p>that four hosses cain’t pull off!” </p><p> Gideon Ashford laughed to save his face,</p><p>so to speak. As yet he had not fought </p><p>either Howling Jim or Bentley; they were to </p><p>him unknown quantities. He found an </p><p>empty box close to Lonesome and sat down. </p><p>Another minute and the commissary door </p><p>opened again. This time a slender and </p><p>nicely-figured girl of not much more than </p><p>twenty’ came in. Snow particles glistened </p><p>like diamond chips on her pale-blue home- </p><p>knit and tasseled headgear and on her cheap </p><p>but warm imitation Paisley shawl. Her </p><p>cheeks were as rosy as red apples from the </p><p>cold air and good health, and her long brown </p><p>eyes were full of laughter twinkles.</p><p> Smiling for no reason whatever, she</p><p>walked across to the counter. She paid </p><p>not the slightest notice to the score of log- </p><p>gers, who had fallen as still as death at the </p><p>sight of her and who now watched her as if </p><p>she were the very last woman in the world. </p><p>Those big, rugged men adored Nancy </p><p>Kirkland. </p><p> “My dad ain’t got any tob'accy,” she</p><p>drawled softly to Billy Allison, the clerk, a </p><p>pale youth who hailed from the lowland. </p><p> Allison gave her a tin of smoking tobacco.</p><p>She put a little silver coin on the counter </p><p>and turned for the door. </p><p> Lonesome Bentley^’s gaze had been fast-</p><p>ened sternly and defiantly upon Gideon </p><p>Ashford’s dark countenance from the mo- </p><p>ment of the girl’s coming. Asliford now </p><p>put his hands on his knees and was about </p><p>to go to his feet. Bentley tapped him </p><p>sharply on the arm. </p><p> “Set still,” said Lonesome.</p><p> “But-”</p><p> “Set still!” Lonesome snapped.</p><p> Ashford stared in amazement at having</p><p>his hand thus called. Then his face </p><p>clouded. </p><p> “I got as good a right to go home with</p><p>her as you have.” </p><p> “No, you ain’t!” Bentley’s low, steely</p><p>voice cut him off. “You ain’t fit!” </p><p> The girl was gone. Ashford rose, and</p><p>his huge and hairy hands curled up into </p><p>fists. Bentley slipped to his feet without </p><p>any apparent effort. </p><p> “You ain't fit,” he reiterated. “Any</p><p>man what lies and steals and drinks and </p><p>gambles ain’t fit to go with any decent </p><p>woman anywhere. I’ve shore said it. Ef </p><p>you want to fight me about it, go to it. </p><p>I’ve took all o’ yore fim-makin’ and mouth- </p><p>in’ I’ll ever take. Ef you want to start </p><p>somethin’ wi’ me, start it right now; I'm </p><p>ready and a-waitin’.” </p><p> Lonesome’s face was pale save for a tiny</p><p>pink spot under the sunburn of either </p><p>cheek. His eyes fairly sparkled. He held </p><p>himself as tense as a coiled steel spring. </p><p>The bully turned red and glanced with a </p><p>sickly grin toward the men who watched </p><p>and waited at Bentley^s elbows. Ashford </p><p>knew that he had to fight or else let the </p><p>outfit take it for granted that he was afraid. </p><p>And that steel spring of a man who stood </p><p>before him dared him to so much as lift a </p><p>finger! </p><p> For a moment there was charged silence.</p><p>It was broken by a silly little guffaw from</p><p>the lowland youth who held forth as com- </p><p>missary clerk, and with that all the loggers </p><p>except the two belligerents themselves </p><p>joined in a roar of derisive laughter. Gid </p><p>Ashford, the fallen false god, became still </p><p>redder. He slumped back to his box, took </p><p>paper and tobacco from his pocket and </p><p>nervously began to roll for himself a cigaret. </p><p> Now that the thing was over, Howling</p><p>Jim Baskin turned and placed a hand </p><p>proudly on his pal’s shoulder. To the sur- </p><p>prize of everybody, Lonesome Bentley </p><p>threw Howling Jim’s hand off angrily. </p><p> “Never mind,” said Lonesome.</p><p> Baskin stared, looked hurt, stepped</p><p>slowly to the counter and leaned against </p><p>it rather heavily. Bentley gave the crest- </p><p>fallen erstwhile bully a look of contempt </p><p>io8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and went alone toward the boarding- </p><p>house. </p><p> Not long afterward the commissary crowd</p><p>began to thin out. At closing time only </p><p>Ashford and Billy Allison, the clerk, were </p><p>there. And Ashford watched young Allison </p><p>keenly as he took the day’s gleanings from </p><p>the money-drawer and placed them in the </p><p>small iron safe. </p><p> The Morgan-Ilaley Company’s commis-</p><p>sary banked but once each month, and these </p><p>deposits ran anywhere from four to eight </p><p>hundred dollars. </p><p>HWHEN Lonesome Bentley went </p><p>toward the boarding-house, Howling </p><p>Jim followed him. Bentley did </p><p>not even look around until he had reached </p><p>the up-stairs sleeping-quarters of the crew, </p><p>in which a big hanging oil lamp burned </p><p>dimly. He gave Baskin a glance that was </p><p>part scowl, undressed without a word to his </p><p>former great crony and crept silently under </p><p>his blankets. Baskin followed suit, and </p><p>for five minutes the two big man lay so still </p><p>there in their narrow beds, within six feet </p><p>of each other, that they seemed to be hardly </p><p>breathing. </p><p> Then Howling Jim put the soft pedal on</p><p>his fog-horn voice and spoke. </p><p> “ Lonesome!”</p><p> No answer.</p><p> “Lonesome,” Baskin pursued, “what is it</p><p>that’s come between you and me?” </p><p> “Never mind,” Bentley said sharply.</p><p> And not another word could Howling</p><p>Jim get out of him that night. </p><p> Howling Jim found slumber forsaking</p><p>him. As for Lonesome, neither did he go</p><p>to sleep readily. His thoughts wouldn’t </p><p>let him sleep. Those thoughts would have </p><p>been highly enlightening to Baskin if only </p><p>he could have read them! </p><p> A week before Lonesome Bentley and</p><p>old Nathan Kirkland’s daughter, who lived </p><p>with her parents in a big hewn-log cabin a </p><p>mile down Big Brother Creek, had quar- </p><p>reled bitterly—so bitterly, in fact, that </p><p>Nancy had snapped off her engagement </p><p>to Bentley as if it had been of no more </p><p>importance than a pie-crust! Lonesome </p><p>didn’t know what they had quarreled about </p><p>and Nancy didn’t remember. That is how it </p><p>goes when young human beings set other </p><p>young human beings up on pedestals as </p><p>models of perfection to worship them. </p><p>The fault was humanity’s, rather than either </p><p>Nancy Kirkland’s or Lonesome Bentley’s </p><p>individually, no doubt. And then- </p><p> Four days after the misunderstanding,</p><p>on a bright Sunday afternoon, Bentley had </p><p>decided that he would try to bridge the </p><p>abyss that yawned between him and his </p><p>sweetheart by going to her and confessing </p><p>that he had been a fool. He had started for </p><p>her home, and by the merest chance he had </p><p>come upon a scene that distressed him </p><p>sorely. Nancy and Howling Jim were </p><p>sitting together under a big poplar; Baskin </p><p>was holding her hand in his, and she was </p><p>smiling at him in her very best way! </p><p>Then Lonesome Bentley had stolen back to </p><p>the camp with red-hot iron in his soul. </p><p> It seemed doubly hard to bear, following,</p><p>as it did, on the heels of news to the effect </p><p>that the Morgan-Haley Company looked </p><p>upon him—Lonesome Bentley, as the very </p><p>best logger in the outfit. Bentley, for all of </p><p>his taciturni ty, was an ambitious young man. </p><p>THOUGH they had lost some sleep, </p><p>Bentley and Baskin sprang from </p><p>their beds at the first ringing blow </p><p>on the railroad iron triangle-gong which </p><p>hung just outside the kitchen door. Neither </p><p>had anything to say. Lonesome was the </p><p>first to get his clothing on. He snatched </p><p>up his hat and hastened down to the dimly- </p><p>lighted back porch to bathe his face and his </p><p>hands. </p><p> He had no more than finished his washing</p><p>when Howling Jim addressed him from the </p><p>open doorway behind him: </p><p> “The super wants to see ye. Lonesome.</p><p>In his office. Said for me to tell ye. By </p><p>grab! That’s good luck, Lonesome!” </p><p> It was a fine bid for talk; however,</p><p>Lonesome failed to nibble. Without a</p><p>single word Bentley threw the icy-cold </p><p>towel to its peg on the wall and went toward </p><p>Superintendent Bradshaw’s little office on </p><p>the first floor. He wondered just what </p><p>the good luck was. A raise in wages, </p><p>maybe. </p><p> The high light of the Morgan-Haley</p><p>camp was a big and bronzed elderly man, </p><p>and he now sat before a small sheet-iron </p><p>stove, which w'as glowing hot. </p><p> "Sit down, Bentley,” he said, pointing</p><p>toward a cheap straight-back. Lonesome </p><p>dropped into the chair, and Bradshaw went </p><p>on: “Nobody knows loggin’ better than </p><p>you know it, Bentley, and I’ve recom- </p><p>mended you for the super’s job here. I’m </p><p>Howling Jim's Pal </p><p>109 </p><p>leavin’ in just fifteen more days. What </p><p>do you think of it? Can you hold it?” </p><p> “1 can read and write and figger enough</p><p>to keep the time-sheets,” Lonesome said </p><p>softly, more to him self than to Bradshaw, </p><p>perhaps. “Shore, I can hold it. I'm </p><p>much obliged to ye, Brad!’’ </p><p> Honest appreciation beamed from his</p><p>eyes. To be the superintendent of a log- </p><p>ging outfit, that was his fondest dream but </p><p>one—and that one concerned Nancy Kirk- </p><p>land, himself and a preacher! He had </p><p>worked hard and for years in the attempt </p><p>to fit himself for a superintendent’s place. </p><p> Bradshaw was about to speak again when</p><p>the door banged open to admit a miniature </p><p>hurricane of cold air and the youthful </p><p>figure of Billy Allison, the commissary </p><p>clerk. Allison snapped the door shut be- </p><p>hind him and turned nervously to the two </p><p>men. </p><p> “The commissary’s front door was broken</p><p>open last night, Brad,” he announced in a </p><p>low and somewhat shaky voice. “Whoever </p><p>it was used a peavy spike which was left </p><p>lying in the snow by the step. But the </p><p>safe is all right, and I didn’t notice that </p><p>anything was gone.” </p><p> Bradshaw rose, and so did Bentley.</p><p>Then the superintendent beckoned to the </p><p>logger, and the three of them went toward </p><p>the company’s general store. Dawn was </p><p>just spreading its great, rose-colored fan </p><p>upward from the crest of Little Brother </p><p>Mountain; the new day promised to be </p><p>clear and bright. </p><p> AJlison had already lighted the great oil</p><p>lamp that hung in the cenLer of the big, </p><p>long room, and he and the other two quickly </p><p>looked over the stock. So far as they were</p><p>able to see, nothing had been stolen. Brad- </p><p>shaw walked back to the safe, which stood </p><p>under the rear end of the counter; it was </p><p>tightly locked. </p><p> “Sure this is all right, Billy?” he asked.</p><p> “I haven't looked inside,” frowned young</p><p>Allison. </p><p> He hastened to the safe, knelt before it</p><p>and within another minute swung open the </p><p>iron door. Then he shot to his feet. </p><p> “It’s all gone—six hundred dollars!” he</p><p>exclaimed. </p><p> He had spoken correctly. The six hun-</p><p>dred dollars in cash was not there. Bentley </p><p>pressed forward and leaned over the counter. </p><p> “Funny how that happened,” was his</p><p>drawling, puzzled comment. “It must ha’ </p><p>been somebody that knowed the combina- </p><p>tion!” </p><p> Billy Allison flashed a quick look toward</p><p>the hillman, as at an accuser. Another </p><p>second and he was staring anxiously into </p><p>the superintendent’s bronzed face. </p><p> “Brad, do you think—” he began.</p><p> Bradshaw interrupted.</p><p> “The lad didn’t do it, Lonesome,” he</p><p>said a trifle sharply. “And I didn’t do it, </p><p>and only us two and Stapleton Haley knows </p><p>the combination. There’s been a smooth </p><p>job pulled off here, Lonesome. We’d better </p><p>send to Jones ville for the sheriff as soon as </p><p>possible. But first maybe we’d better see </p><p>whether there’s any footprints leadin’ off </p><p>from the commissary. Eh?” </p><p> Bentley nodded, and Allison said eagerly:</p><p> “Yes; the snow had stopped falling when</p><p>I closed last night, and the robber couldn’t </p><p>have gone anywhere except to the boarding- </p><p>house without his footprints giving him </p><p>away.” </p><p> It was now light enough for them to see</p><p>even the track of a rabbit in the snow out- </p><p>side. They walked a wide circle in the </p><p>clearing, encompassing both the commissary </p><p>and the boarding-house without coming </p><p>upon a single footprint that couldn’t be </p><p>easily accounted for. Which was con- </p><p>clusive proof that both the thief and the </p><p>money were still in camp. </p><p> When they had come to the commissary’s</p><p>front doorway again, Bradshaw turned to </p><p>Bentley with this: </p><p> “One of the loggin’-engines ought to</p><p>have some fire in it from yesterday, Lone- </p><p>some. Sneak over to the tracks and take </p><p>one dawn to Jones ville and bring the </p><p>sheriff. It’s down-grade nearly all the </p><p>way, and you can raise steam as you go.</p><p>Hurry!” </p><p> Bentley ran to the tracks, leaped aboard</p><p>one of the geared locomotives and loosed </p><p>the brakes. The wheels began to turn. </p><p> The passing of an hour found him in the</p><p>foot-hills with a fair head of steam coming </p><p>on. Two hours after sunrise he was speak- </p><p>ing hastily with Garrett Henry, the lanky </p><p>and serious, blue-clad and broad-hatted </p><p>Jonesville sheriff. </p><p>IT WAS not far from noontime </p><p>when the thundering staccato of </p><p>the small, geared engine’s laboring </p><p>exhaust reached the ears of those who waited </p><p>at the Morgan-Hale}' camp on Big Brother </p><p>no </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Creek. The crew had not gone to work in </p><p>the woods that day. When at last the </p><p>little locomotive came to a halt in the camp </p><p>clearing, Garrett Henry and Bentley leaped </p><p>to the snowy ground and went to meet </p><p>Superintendent Bradshaw. </p><p> “Find out anything more?” growled the</p><p>officer. </p><p> Bradshaw shook his head.</p><p> “But the thief is still here, and the money,</p><p>too. You’ve got a chance to show us how </p><p>smart you are, all right I” </p><p> Henry merely grunted. The trio walked</p><p>on and entered the commissary, which was </p><p>half filled with expectant timberjacks. An </p><p>accommodating logger passed to the sheriff </p><p>the peavy that had been used in breaking </p><p>open the door. Henry looked it over, </p><p>saw that it was only an ordinary implement </p><p>of its kind and put it down. Then he and </p><p>the superintendent and Bentley went back </p><p>to the safe, where the officer asked questions </p><p>soberly, nodded a great deal and made a </p><p>superficial examination. Howling Jim Bas- </p><p>kin had followed them; he idly dropped a </p><p>friendly hand to Lonesome Bentley’s arm, </p><p>and Bentley threw it off as if it were a tiling </p><p>of unspeakable contamination! </p><p> “Somebody who knowed the combina-</p><p>tion,” decided Henry. </p><p> “It was not,” firmly replied Bradshaw.</p><p> He himself had vouched for the honesty</p><p>of Billy Allison. </p><p> The sheriff began to strike matches that</p><p>he might better see into dark corners about </p><p>the safe. Suddenly he bent lower and </p><p>picked up a small, square object that was </p><p>mostly white. As he straightened to bring </p><p>it into better light—Henry’s eyes had never </p><p>been so good as his courage—a muscular </p><p>arm in corduroy shot over his shoulder and</p><p>seized it, and, before the passing of another </p><p>second, the man to whom that arm belonged </p><p>was running like a race-horse for the door- </p><p>way! </p><p> it was Howling Jim, who had, by chance,</p><p>been standing directly behind the officer. </p><p>Henry snatched his revolver from its </p><p>holster and called upon Baskin to halt. </p><p>Half a dozen loggers stepped out of the </p><p>path of a possible bullet. But Howling </p><p>Jim didn’t stop; he drove through the door- </p><p>way, turned sharply to his left and out of </p><p>the sheriff’s range of vision and made for </p><p>the near-by woods. </p><p> Henry followed rapidly to the door-sill,</p><p>and Lonesome Bentley was within a yard of </p><p>him when he reached it. Then Garrett </p><p>Henry leveled his revolver at the fleeing </p><p>figure. Baskin was running unwisely in a </p><p>straight line, his brown-clad body making a </p><p>plain and almost stationary target against </p><p>the dead white of the snow. But before </p><p>Henry could fire, Bentley caught his right </p><p>shoulder and pulled him backward. </p><p> “Not that!” growled Lonesome, ashen-</p><p>faced and defiant. “You don’t kill Jim </p><p>Baskin as easy as that!” </p><p> When Henry recovered himself, Baskin</p><p>was in the laurels and his escape assured. </p><p>The officer now turned his attention to </p><p>Bentley, and there was a queer smile about </p><p>liis lips. * </p><p> “Pals, eh?”</p><p> “Mighty good pals—” began Lonesome,</p><p>remembering Nancy' Kirkland and breaking </p><p>off short. </p><p> For the fractional part of a minute he</p><p>looked away at nothing, and, when he </p><p>again turned his eyes toward the JonesviJle </p><p>sheriff, he found himself staring straight </p><p>into the muzzle of a Colt .45. </p><p> “It’s my duty to arrest you,” quietly said</p><p>Garrett Henry, “as a pardner in this </p><p>robbery'.” </p><p> Lonesome Bentley' lived a long time in the</p><p>moment that followed tin’s announcement. </p><p>In his mind?s eye he saw himself and Nancy </p><p>—when he had asked her—when she had </p><p>agreed to marry’ him. He saw himself and </p><p>Nancy when they had quarreled over—he </p><p>didn’t remember what. And he saw Howl- </p><p>ing Jim, his pal, holding the girl’s hand </p><p>while she smiled her best smile into his </p><p>rugged face. All of it—his bright hopes of </p><p>a superin tendency, the robbery, the accusa- </p><p>tion and all the rest of it—somehow tangled </p><p>him, muddled him. dazed him. It seemed </p><p>unreal, like a bad dream. . . .</p><p> The sheriff was speaking again—</p><p> “I’ll have to search you, Bentley.”</p><p>Lonesome gave no sign that he had heard. </p><p>As Henry began to go through the pockets </p><p>of his prisoner, Nancy Kirkland walked </p><p>smilingly into the commissary and turned </p><p>toward Billy Allison, who now stood in his </p><p>place behind the counter. </p><p> “I want some sug-”</p><p> That was as far as she ever got with it,</p><p>for at that instant she caught sight of the </p><p>sheriff and Lonesome Bentley. She .went </p><p>immediately toward them. </p><p> “What—what’s that for?” she demanded</p><p>in a small, thin voice. </p><p>Howling Jim’s Pal </p><p>111 </p><p> Nobody answered. The officer went on</p><p>with his slow and exceedingly careful search </p><p>of Bentley’s clothing. Lonesome looked </p><p>toward her, smiled a tiny smile that seemed </p><p>desperate rather than merry and turned his </p><p>gaze aside. Gideon Ashford, wrho had been </p><p>watching the entire proceedings with tri- </p><p>umph written largely over his dark coun- </p><p>tenance, touched Nancy Kirkland’s arm </p><p>and whispered— </p><p> “I’ll tell ye ef nobody else won’t.”</p><p> With several backward glances toward</p><p>BentJey the girl went with Ashford to the </p><p>snow-covered ground outside. There Ash- </p><p>ford blew sparks from his home-made </p><p>cigaret and bent forward with this: </p><p> “Lonesome was cuniinger’n I thought he</p><p>was,” in low tones. “He was cunning </p><p>enough to open the commissary safe and </p><p>take out the six hundred dollars the’ was in </p><p>it and leave it locked up jest like it was </p><p>afore! It’s shore a joke on him—he went </p><p>and brung the sheriff out and ’en got ar- </p><p>rested hisself!” </p><p> “He never done the robbin’!” flared</p><p>Nancy, her brown eyes wide and sparkling </p><p>with resentment. “He wouldn’t never do </p><p>it!” </p><p> Ashford shrugged his ox-like shoulders.</p><p>“Forchunitly or onforchunitly, ye don’t </p><p>haf to take my word for it. Look here!” </p><p>Through the open door he had seen </p><p>Garrett Henry unhook a safety-pin from </p><p>the upper edge of one of Bentley’s inside </p><p>coat pockets and take out a sizeable roll of </p><p>bank-notes! Ashford stepped hastily back </p><p>across the door-sill, and Nancy Kirkland </p><p>followed with a lump in her throat. With </p><p>one eye still on his prisoner Henry counted </p><p>the money through, after which he said to </p><p>Bentley:</p><p>“Six hundred, I believe you told me. </p><p>Here’s two hundred and ten. You didn’t </p><p>quite get your share, did you, Lonesome?” </p><p>Bentley was still ashen-faced, still defiant. </p><p>He straightened even a little more. </p><p> “You mean that me and Howlin’</p><p>Jim-” </p><p> “I mean that you and Howlin’ Jim wrent</p><p>pardners in the deal,” hazarded the sheriff. </p><p>“Better confess, Lonesome. It’ll go easier </p><p>with you, you know. Now just how did </p><p>you and Howlin’ manage to get the money </p><p>without workin’ the combination?” </p><p> “Charmed it-out,” drawled Bentley in the</p><p>keenest sarcasm. He brought his’ hands </p><p>up to the lapels of his corduroy coat and </p><p>with a forefinger rubbed his chin as if re- </p><p>flectively. “One of us stood on each side o’ </p><p>the safe. How'lin’ would say, ‘Keeno, </p><p>Presto,’ and I’d say, ‘Pr«sto, Keeno.’ And </p><p>purty soon the money jest tumbled right </p><p>out.” </p><p> Lonesome interrupted himself with a</p><p>master play. He brought his two hands </p><p>downward and in one lightning-like move- </p><p>ment drove Garrett Henry’s revolver fifteen </p><p>feet out of his grip and seized the roll of two </p><p>hundred and ten dollars in bank-notes. </p><p>That money represented Bentley’s savings </p><p>for a year. Henry sprang to recover his </p><p>weapon, and Lonesome sprang for the out- </p><p>side. As the sheriff ran toward the door </p><p>with his revolver in his hand, a peavy came </p><p>hurtling before his legs, tripping him, </p><p>causing him to fall heavily. When he rose, </p><p>Bentley was in the laurels. </p><p> Seeing that Lonesome, too, had escaped</p><p>him, the fuming sheriff turned back and </p><p>stopped squarely before Nancy Kirkland. </p><p> “You, too!” he exclaimed. “You throwed</p><p>the peavy, eh?” </p><p> “I shore did,” Nancy admitted. “It</p><p>ain’t any secret. What're ye a-goin’ to do </p><p>about it?” </p><p> Henry’s countenance was threatening—</p><p>and, considering that morning’s run of </p><p>luck for him, one may hardly blame him. </p><p> “I’ll arrest you as a—a accomplice; that’s</p><p>what I’m a-goin’ to do about it!” he said. </p><p> It was then that the camp rose and spoke</p><p>as a single man. </p><p> “I’ll be danged ef ye do!”</p><p> Hemy faced the loggers—loggers who</p><p>adored Nathan Kirkland’s daughter. </p><p> “What’s that?” he demanded.</p><p> “I’ll be danged ef ye do!” the camp spoke</p><p>yet again, and it came a little more deter- </p><p>minedly than before.</p><p>FOR the first hundred yards after he </p><p>had gained the snowy underbrush, </p><p>_Bentley’s thoughts wrere occupied </p><p>wholly with making good his escape. No </p><p>man of his people had ever been to jail, and </p><p>he wasn't going so long as he could avoid it. </p><p>Then, seeing that he was in no immediate </p><p>danger of capture—the average down-South </p><p>sheriff knows the hopelessness of chasing a </p><p>mountaineer in the laurels—Bentley began </p><p>to wonder what the small white object was </p><p>that Garrett Henry had found Hong under </p><p>the safe. Soon he decided that he would </p><p>strike Baskin’s trail in the snow, overtake </p><p>112 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>him and find out. Also, he would bring the- </p><p>lit tie matter of Howling Jim’s love-making </p><p>to Nancy to a show-down. </p><p> fifteen minutes more and he had come</p><p>upon the footprints for which he had been </p><p>searching. They led him up a bank of the </p><p>creek for a mile and then turned to the left </p><p>and were lost tin bare ground under a great </p><p>patch of hemlocks that stood so thickly </p><p>that their interlaced branches had caught </p><p>nearly all the snow that had fallen on them. </p><p>Howling Jim had brought into effect a </p><p>woodsman’s trick here in order to halt pos- </p><p>sible pursuit, and Lonesome suspected it at </p><p>once. Lonesome began to look for the </p><p>answer, and soon his gaze rested upon a </p><p>spot at which the bare ground ran within </p><p>half a dozen yards of Big Brother Creek. </p><p> Bentley nodded understanding. Just as</p><p>Baskin had done, he backed off, ran hard </p><p>and leaped over the few yards of snowy </p><p>ground, landing somewhere near the middle </p><p>of die shallow stream. </p><p> He walked a mile up the stony little creek</p><p>before he found Howling Jim’s footprints </p><p>leading out of it. The trail now took him </p><p>high on the side of Little Brother Mountain </p><p>and then across an outstanding spur and </p><p>into a deep cove, and he was not more than </p><p>half-way down the side of this cove when </p><p>darkness closed in upon liiin. It was im- </p><p>possible, of course, for him to follow the </p><p>string of footprints farther before daylight </p><p>came again. Lonesome Bentley halted. </p><p>He was chagrined but by no means beaten. </p><p>He was cold now. His wet feet seemed </p><p>frozen, and he stamped them on the ground </p><p>to help the circulation in them. </p><p> It was still, very still, and Lonesome</p><p>stood and listened. A few minutes later </p><p>he heard faintly, coming from somewhere </p><p>in the bottom of the dark cove below him,</p><p>a snatch of the foolish old song that Howling </p><p>Jim was so fond of singing in a sort of </p><p>abandon— </p><p>"I'm a-goin’ to live, anyhow, till I die!” </p><p> Bentley stole softly onward, downward,</p><p>heading for a tiny point of llame that had </p><p>suddenly come to life in the woods </p><p>below. </p><p> Howling Jim Baskin sat before a brush-</p><p>wood fire that he had just made at the </p><p>base of an overhanging cliff. The fire made </p><p>dancing and grotesque shadows there in the </p><p>wild forest. Baskin held his wet feet in his </p><p>wet boots near the flames. The muffled </p><p>sound of a twig being broken in the snow </p><p>caused him to look around quickly. </p><p> Lonesome Bentley, seeming doubly stal-</p><p>wart and doubly serious in the flickering </p><p>firelight, walked slowly up and stood </p><p>looking straight into the upturned and </p><p>smiling lace of his pal. He had suffered </p><p>an almost overpowering wave of sudden, </p><p>insensate anger. It was his intention to de- </p><p>nounce Howling Jim as a black traitor to all </p><p>iriendship. But in a second’s time there </p><p>flashed on the palimpsest of his brain scenes </p><p>from the good old days that he and Baskin </p><p>had spent together, scenes that pictured </p><p>little kindnesses, confidences, almost tender- </p><p>nesses. </p><p> So, when Lonesome finally spoke, he said</p><p>only this— </p><p> “My feet's about froze, Howlin'.”</p><p>“Shore,” grinned Baskin. “Mine was </p><p>too, by grab! Set down and w'arm 'em. </p><p>Have any trouble a-trackin’ me, Lone- </p><p>some ?” His voice was full of gladness. </p><p> “Not much,” Bentley answered. He</p><p>went on, “Do ye reckon Garrett Henry </p><p>can foller us. Howlin’?” </p><p> “Him? Humph! No, by grab! He</p><p>ain’t smart enough for that, nor enough </p><p>used to the woods. But—but they didn’t </p><p>have nothin’ agin you, Lonesome!” </p><p> Bentley shrugged his shoulders.</p><p> “No, nothin’—only-they arrested me as a</p><p>pardner in the rob'ry; that’s all. And they </p><p>s’arched me and took my money; that’s all. </p><p>But I got it back. Jail? Not for me, </p><p>Howlin', ef anybody happens to name it </p><p>to ye!” </p><p> He dragged up a flat stone, turned the dry</p><p>side up, sat down on it and put his feet over </p><p>the fire. He was at the point of asking </p><p>Howling Jim w’hat it was that he had </p><p>snatched from Sheriff Henry's hand, when </p><p>Baskin said slowly: </p><p> “Leather burns quick when it’s wTet,</p><p>Lonesome; don’t stick ’em too dost. By </p><p>the way, Lonesome, I got somethin’ here </p><p>what belongs to you.” </p><p> From an inside coat pocket he drew an</p><p>opened and unstamped and somewhat </p><p>crumpled letter that had Bentley’s name in </p><p>a thin, feminine scrawl on the envelope, </p><p>and this he passed into the hands of his </p><p>pal. </p><p> “I never read it, o’ course,” he said.</p><p>Bentley took the missive and pocketed it </p><p>almost without looking at it. He had been </p><p>careful of the few letters Nancy had wTitten </p><p>Howling Jim’s Pal </p><p>113 </p><p>him, and it amazed him to think that he </p><p>had lost one. </p><p> “Much obliged, Howlin’,” he muttered.</p><p>“Where’d ye find it?” </p><p> “It was that,” said Baskin, “that the</p><p>sheriff picked up from under the commissary </p><p>safe, which I took from him and run with. </p><p>I seed the ad-dress afore he did, and I—I </p><p>knowed you never had no business back </p><p>there—and I thought—I thought you-” </p><p> “I see,” cut in Lonesome. “You thought</p><p>it’d put me in bad about the safe-robbin’, </p><p>and you done it to clear me. Well, it was a </p><p>fool thing to do, for I never lost the letter </p><p>there, I’m shore! But—btit you-” </p><p> He broke off, flushed slightly and began</p><p>to stir the fire with a boot-heel. Baskin </p><p>took up the thread that he had dropped: </p><p>“Brad had told me jest afore he sent me </p><p>to ye this mornin’, Lonesome, that you was </p><p>might’ nigh shore to be the camp’s high- </p><p>boy purty soon, and I was a-thinkin’ about </p><p>that when I took the letter and cut the </p><p>mustard for the timber. It’d ha’ sp’iled </p><p>the job for ye. Lonesome, at least. I </p><p>knowed, y’see, how much ye wanted to be </p><p>a super. And, as for me,” smiling, his eyes </p><p>twinkling, “I—well, it don’t matter about </p><p>me. ’Cause I’m a-goin’ to live, anyhow, </p><p>till I die! Now ain’t 1?” </p><p> He looked back to the fire. Lonesome</p><p>turned his gaze hard upon the rugged profile </p><p>of his pal. So this was the fellow whom he </p><p>had been about to denounce as a black </p><p>traitor to their friendship. Lonesome Bent- </p><p>ley wished vaguely that he were another </p><p>man in order that he might kick himself </p><p>clean across Little Brother Mountain. </p><p> “You been mad at me, Lonesome,”</p><p>suddenly said Howling Jim, without taking </p><p>his eyes from the glowing coals. “It was </p><p>partly that, too, what made me take the </p><p>letter and run with it. I wisht I knowed</p><p>what you been mad at me about, Lone- </p><p>some.” </p><p> Bentley told him straightforwardly:</p><p> “I seed you a-holdin’ Nancy’s hand.</p><p>There on the creek, at the big poplar. It </p><p>flew all over me like powder a-burnin’; </p><p>I’ve died a thousand times sence that one </p><p>minute, Howlin’. I reckon I ain’t got any </p><p>sense. I reckon ye must ha’ had some good </p><p>reason for a-doin’ that, but I shore couldn’t </p><p>see it thataway till now.” </p><p> Howling Jim sat up straight, smiling.</p><p> “I did have a good reason, Lonesome,”</p><p>he said. “That is, I think I did, by grab! </p><p>8 </p><p>I’ll leave it to you. Y^’see, I could easy tell </p><p>that somethin’ had come between you and </p><p>her, and I was a-beggin” her to take ye back </p><p>—and a-tellin her what a fine, good young </p><p>man ye was and how much ye liked her </p><p>and how happy she’d alius be with you!” </p><p>“Was—that—it?” gasped Bentley. </p><p> “God knows it was,” said Baskin.</p><p> He went into his corduroy coat and came</p><p>back with something wrapped neatly in a </p><p>blue bandanna. Ever so carefully he took </p><p>the bandamia from it with his big and bun- </p><p>gling but wonderfully gentle hands and </p><p>passed it over to his pal. Lonesome took it </p><p>and held it up to the dancing firelight. It </p><p>was an old-fashioned tintype picture of a </p><p>bareheaded and barefooted mountain lass, </p><p>a smiling and pretty little mountain lass in </p><p>calico. </p><p> “My sweetheart,” Howling Jim said.</p><p>“This is the only real secret I’ve ever kept </p><p>from you, Lonesome. I never talk about it.” </p><p>“Where is she now?” </p><p> “Under the snow.”</p><p> After a minute of silence Baskin went on:</p><p>“I ain’t never seed nobody else what </p><p>could tak,e her place, and I know I never </p><p>will. That’s why I go along a-singin’ and </p><p>a-whoopin’ through life, jest to forgit, </p><p>a-doin’ the best I can with the little that the </p><p>Almighty put into my wo’thless cyarcass, </p><p>for I’m mostly jest plain meat, I reckon. </p><p>It wasn’t much o’ my business, I know, </p><p>Lonesome, for me to go to Nancy and ax her </p><p>to take ye back. But—well, I thought </p><p>mebbe-” </p><p> “It’s all right,” said Lonesome. “I</p><p>thank ye for that, Howlin’. A man never </p><p>had a better pal ’an you, Howlin’. I shore </p><p>beg yer pardon for a bein’ so low-down mean </p><p>to ye! Here’s the little picture.” </p><p> He gave Baskin the tintype and rose.</p><p>He would go straight back to Garrett</p><p>Henry and tell him everything, though it </p><p>surely meant jail for him. Baskin put the </p><p>picture into his pocket, and he, too, went to </p><p>liis feet. Just then there came a most sur- </p><p>prizing addition to the little drama there </p><p>in the snowy wilderness. </p><p>THOSE two were not the only men </p><p>in that wild country who knew </p><p>woodcraft. An eavesdropper who </p><p>had stationed himself on the cliff just </p><p>above had lost his perilous footing, and he </p><p>now came hurtling down with a resounding </p><p>thump between Lonesome Bentley and </p><p>ii4 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Howling Jim Baskin. The newcomer car- </p><p>ried a revolver in a holster, and he wore a </p><p>deputy's shield on his coat. It was Gideon </p><p>Ashford. </p><p> Lonesome drew back a little as the Big</p><p>Brother ('reek camp's erstwhile bully </p><p>turned a drawn and ashen face upward. </p><p> “You was shore in a devil of a hurry to</p><p>get here, Gid!" he exclaimed mockingly. </p><p>“Why couldn't ye jest ha' walked in like a </p><p>decent white man?” </p><p> Baskin forgot himseLf and raised his fog-</p><p>horn voice: </p><p> “Drapped right down out o’ the blue sky,</p><p>by grab! Do ye bring us any glad message </p><p>from the moon, Gid?” </p><p> Ashford struggled there on the ground</p><p>between them, trying in vain to rise. </p><p> “My laig—” he mumbled. “Oh—my</p><p>laig-” </p><p> “By grab!” suddenly cried Howling Jim.</p><p>“Ef his laig ain’t broke plumb in two, might’ </p><p>nigh! Look there, Lonesome—it’s all </p><p>doubled up, and a bone is a-stickin’ through </p><p>below his knee!” </p><p> Bentley stooped over and saw, and he</p><p>shuddered in spite of himself. </p><p> “It’s a-bleedin\” Ashford said nerve-</p><p>lessly ; “it’s a-bleedin’—Lonesome. You and </p><p>Howlin’ git me to a doctor ef ye can.” </p><p> “WTe can, all right,” Bentley replied</p><p>narrowly. “We could simply take ye to </p><p>the camp, and Super Brad'd shoot ye'down </p><p>to Jonesville on a loggin’-inglne. But you </p><p>know what’s a-waitin’ for us at the camp!” </p><p>“What—Garrett Henry?” </p><p> “Yeuh, Garrett Henry,” Baskin nodded.</p><p>“And maybe a jail sentence or two. Ye </p><p>cain’t ax us to face it, Gid, a-hatin’ jail like </p><p>we does. But we’re sorry for ye, ’count o’ </p><p>seein’ ve so bad hurt. Though it might ha’ </p><p>sarved ye jest about right for a-snoopin’ up </p><p>there on the clitt, a-listenin’ to us open our</p><p>hearts to the bottom. Still, we’re sorry for </p><p>ye, Gid.” </p><p> “I’m much obliged, shore,” tremulously</p><p>growled Ashford. “But you a-bein’ sorry </p><p>for me don’t do me a dang bit o’ good!" </p><p> “Ef I might ax,” drawled Lonesome,</p><p>pointing to the deputy’s shield that Ashford </p><p>wore, “how comes it that ye’re a sportin’ </p><p>that little bright thing on ye coat ? ’Cause </p><p>it's purty?” </p><p> At this thrust Gideon Ashford stared</p><p>silently. His broken limb was beginning </p><p>to give him exerutiating pain now. Baskin </p><p>winked slyly at his sober-faced pal. </p><p> “And he’s a-carryin’ that .45, I reckon,</p><p>Lonesome, to keep anybody from a-takin’ </p><p>the badge offen him! Say, Gid, that shore </p><p>looks to me like Sheriff Henry’s gun. How </p><p>much did he offer ye to bring us in? Tell </p><p>the truth, or I wisht I may drap dead in my </p><p>tracks ef I turn a hand to he'p ye. And </p><p>goodness knows ye’re in a bad fix' out here </p><p>miles from nowhere and not able to walk </p><p>a step and ready to bleed to death.” </p><p>Ashford didn’t answer. He glanced to- </p><p>ward the widening red circle in the snow </p><p>under his leg, and fear gripped his heart- </p><p>strings. Lonesome Bentley looked mean- </p><p>ingly at Howling Jim. </p><p> "We’d better light a rag awfay from here,</p><p>Howlin’,” said he. “The sheriff might </p><p>come enny minute. Come on; le's go. </p><p>Good night to ye, Gid!” </p><p> The two turned from the fire, leaving</p><p>.Ashford staring after them with eyes that </p><p>w'ere afraid and full of pain, and started up </p><p>the cove in the silent darkness. When they </p><p>had gone well out of the circle of firelight, </p><p>Baskin nudged his companion and whis- </p><p>pered : </p><p> “Do ye really mean to leave him that-</p><p>away, Lonesome? Wasn’t we a little </p><p>rough to him?” </p><p> “We won’t go far,” Bentley whispered</p><p>back. “Maybe we was a little rough to </p><p>him, but it was in self-defense. Don’t </p><p>y’see, Howlin’? Ef Gid knows anything </p><p>aboul the rob’rv, mebbe he’ll tell it as the </p><p>price of us a-carrvin’ him to the camp. </p><p>He knows he’ll die here, and jail is alius </p><p>betler’n death to a skunk. I got a notion </p><p>Gid is the robber hisself. Howlin’, ’cause </p><p>he’s die only man in the outfit what's </p><p>low-down enough to pull off a job like </p><p>that.” </p><p> “I’ve wondered ef it could possibly ha’</p><p>been Billy Allison. He’s sort o’ light- </p><p>headed. Lonesome, a-bein ■’ not much more’n</p><p>a boy. IIow could Gid ha’ got the safe </p><p>open?” </p><p> “Ax somebody else. I don’t know.</p><p>But-” </p><p> A jerking, agonized yell from Gideon</p><p>Ashford cut Bentley’s speech short: </p><p> “Lonesome, come back! I’ll make it safe</p><p>for ye at the camp!” </p><p> The two pals turned and walked slowly</p><p>to the now low-burned fire. Ashford </p><p>slopped his groaning long enough to suggest </p><p>that they carry him to the edge of the </p><p>camp clearing and leave him there. They </p><p>Howling Jim’s Pal </p><p>115 </p><p>wouldn’t listen, and Ashford began to </p><p>groan again. Finally he broke down com- </p><p>pletely. </p><p> “Take me to Garrett Henry,” he begged,</p><p>“and I’ll dear ye both. It was me that </p><p>robbed the safe. It was me that drapped </p><p>the letter there at the safe, but I didn’t do </p><p>it a-purpose. I never knowed I’d lost it </p><p>till Henry found it. I hid the six hundred </p><p>dollars in the up-stairs o’ the boardin’- </p><p>house. Nancy, she handed me that letter </p><p>to give to you, Lonesome, and I—I-” </p><p> “Opened it and read it,” clipped Bentley,</p><p>“like .skunks alius does. Go on wi’ the </p><p>cat-killin’. How did ye git in the safe, </p><p>Gid?” </p><p> “I watched Billy Allison when he put</p><p>the money in it the night afore,” confessed </p><p>the pain-wracked Ashford, “and he—I seed </p><p>that the fool boy’d forgot to lock it! Hurry, </p><p>Lonesome, for I’m a-hurtin’ awful, and I'd </p><p>ruther go to jail ’an to die out here in the </p><p>cold.” </p><p> “Well, by grab!” almost shouted Howling</p><p>Jim Baskin as he knelt to fashion a blue </p><p>bandanna tourniquet for Ashford’s tom and </p><p>bleeding limb. </p><p> While Baskin worked with the injured</p><p>man, Lonesome took Nancy’s letter from </p><p>his pocket, the letter that he had thought an </p><p>old one, and read it by the firelight. In it </p><p>Nancy declared that she had hardly slept </p><p>since she had broken her engagement with </p><p>him and asked him to forgive her, if he </p><p>could, for having been such a fool. Bent- </p><p>ley’s heart leaped almost to liis throat, and </p><p>his smile was broad as he remembered that </p><p>he had once started to her to beg her for- </p><p>giveness for that same white little sin. </p><p>FIFTEEN days later, more or less, </p><p>there came a bright and sunny </p><p>Sunday afternoon when the snow </p><p>was all gone. Bentley and Nancy walked</p><p>up the woods path that led from old Nathan </p><p>Kirkland’s hewn-log cabin, entered the </p><p>grassy clearing that held the logging-camp </p><p>on Big Brother Creek and went to the </p><p>boarding-house porch. There they turned </p><p>to face smilingly some thirty stalwart </p><p>timberjacks who had just broken off their </p><p>usual Sunday afternoon horse-play to watch </p><p>them. </p><p> “Boys,” began the strong young man on</p><p>the porch, removing his broad-brimmed hat </p><p>with a rather grandiose sweep of his right </p><p>hand, “I beg permission to interduce Missis </p><p>Superintendent Lonesome Bentley. Wish </p><p>us well, boys!” </p><p> At first there was a mere murmur of</p><p>sound among the loggers; then a ripple— </p><p>then a wild and hearty yell rose from their </p><p>throats and shattered itself against the two </p><p>mountainsides. Bentley began to look the </p><p>loggers over a trifle anxiously. WTiere was </p><p>Howling Jim? He had invited Baskin to </p><p>be present at his wedding, but Baskin </p><p>hadn’t promised. A hundred times before </p><p>he had located his pal by merely listening </p><p>for him; so now he raised a hand for silence, </p><p>and silence came. </p><p> From somewhere high on the laurel-</p><p>covered breast of the everlasting Big </p><p>Brother there came to the ears of those in </p><p>the valley a half-sad voice lifted up in a sort </p><p>of abandon: </p><p>“Ye may break-a my bones with-a sticks ana </p><p> stones—</p><p> I’m a-goin’ to live, anyhow, till I die!”</p><p> Author oj “Heathens," “The Devil's Own," etc.</p><p>The first part of the story briefly retold in story form. </p><p>" U URRICANE” WILLIAMS, clad in a pair </p><p>of trousers cut off at the knee, his skin burned </p><p>black as that of a savage by the sun of the Southern </p><p>Pacific, looked out from under heavy brows at the </p><p>slender young man before him. </p><p> “Gilbert Lang,” he said, “I am an outlaw—a#</p><p>nigger-lover. The most hated and despised white </p><p>man in the South Sea Islands. Why do you want </p><p>to come with me?” </p><p> Silently Lang held out a hand which bore a heavy</p><p>ring on which were carved Greek Letters. Williams </p><p>seized the hand and gazed at the ring keenly. Then </p><p>he asked a question. </p><p> “Man or woman?”</p><p> “Both—probably. I know they came to some</p><p>one of these islands, and I was told that you went </p><p>about on these islands more than any man. So I </p><p>came to you.” </p><p> Williams motioned to two handsome young</p><p>savages, who came running. </p><p> “They will get your traps ashore and bring</p><p>them here,” he said to Lang. </p><p> So Gilbert Lang came to be the only while</p><p>follower of Hurricane Williams. Of black followers </p><p>Williams had many. A swarm of Tongans and </p><p>Samoans, men and women, boys and girls, followed </p><p>Williams as he went about the Soulh Seas, trading, </p><p>fishing, wandering, lie was known as a terror. </p><p>He was far more intelligent than I he traders who </p><p>hated him. And he had nothing to do with white </p><p>men until Gilbert Lang came to him. </p><p> “Vengeance is mine," was written in Greek on</p><p>the ring that l&gt;ang wore, and the three words told </p><p>what had brought him to the South Sea*. It was to </p><p>revenge himself on the man and woman—brother </p><p>and sister, supposedly—who had killed his brother. </p><p>George and Alice Brown were their names, and </p><p>Alice Brown had been his brother’s wife. Lang </p><p>had never seen either. He had sought them across </p><p>the earth to the South Seas and joined fortunes </p><p>with Williams that he might seek them the </p><p>belter. </p><p> Slowly he became accustomed to the strange Lite.</p><p>The savages he found childlike in their happiness </p><p>and love of play. The old men and women petted </p><p>him; the young men became his comrades; the </p><p>young girls coquetted with him; the children played </p><p>with him. </p><p> Then Williams took the whole party on board</p><p>his ship, the Mary, and sailed to an island where </p><p>he knew of oyster-beds. Williams half expected </p><p>a light at the oyster beds. Not with the natives, </p><p>for lie quickly made friends with Ghorki, chief of </p><p>the Gopassa people, and with Baraka, the devil- </p><p>devil man. But with Willerby, king of the South </p><p>Seas, who also knew of the wealth of the place. </p><p> As Lang sat alone one day. Uala. most beautiful</p><p>of the native girls, crept up to him. </p><p> "f love you," she said softly.</p><p> Lang was lonesome and homesick. Uala was</p><p>beautiful. He kissed her. </p><p> “Langl” He heard an angry voice behind him,</p><p>and he turned to see Williams glare at him a moment </p><p>and then stride away. </p><p>GILBERT Lang was suffused with </p><p>a feeling of guilt and shame. He, </p><p>on a quest of vengeance, had </p><p>stooped to dalliance, and with a </p><p>savage! Memory of it would have been </p><p>distressing enough without having to re- </p><p>member that Williams had come upon them. </p><p>Williams was an enigma. Much about </p><p>him was distasteful, yet his tense, dominant, </p><p>personality in a certain way compelled </p><p>admiration, and though Gilbert Lang tried </p><p>to tell himself that he cared not one way or </p><p>the other for Williams’ approval, yet he </p><p>knew that it was not so. He did care. </p><p>He wished that he might not have to face</p><p>Williams again. </p><p>116 </p><p>SAVAGES </p><p>A Tour-Vart Story </p><p>Part f] </p><p>BY GORDON TOl/NG </p><p>Savages </p><p>117 </p><p> What tidal folly could have so swept him</p><p>from his senses? True, Uala was beautiful </p><p>and sweet. But at best she was a native. </p><p>Perhaps those pretty teeth of hers had </p><p>picked dead men’s bones! He shivered. </p><p>He had kissed her again and again. </p><p> Tears of rage and shame came to his eyes</p><p>and stood there glistening. The very </p><p>thought of her evoked something of the </p><p>fascination of her presence, and he tried </p><p>to loath himself for his weakness in not </p><p>being thoroughly disgusted. </p><p> Gilbert Lang was one of those complex</p><p>organisms that can only be bred far from </p><p>fields and forests. The noblesse oblige of </p><p>culture was ingrained in him—or, rather, had </p><p>veneered him. All men are emotionally </p><p>alike deep down in their hearts; only in some </p><p>the emotions are rarely, if ever, stirred. </p><p>He was a clean-hearted, pure-eyed boy; but </p><p>he was very young, and he had come from a </p><p>hot-house world into jungles. He was be- </p><p>wildered that there was within him unsus- </p><p>pected emotions—weaknesses, to his way </p><p>of thinking—that leaped up like monsters </p><p>conjured by a wizard. </p><p> He had killed men; he had pressed his</p><p>lips to the mouth of a savage woman! No. </p><p>Gilbert Lang did not know, could not </p><p>know, that the roots of him were down the </p><p>mold; that he was a human being and </p><p>nothing more; that the only difference be- </p><p>tween him and a bushman was the </p><p>superficial difference of color and culture. </p><p>He was no more aware of that than he was </p><p>aware that he, aVid all men, carry within </p><p>them traces of the gills that served then- </p><p>amphibian ancestors.	*</p><p> So he lay homesick, heart-sick and</p><p>shamed; lay on his face, and his face was </p><p>buried in the crook of his arm. </p><p> It was late in the afternoon when he</p><p>looked up, and he rubbed his eyes from </p><p>surprize. </p><p> Three ships had entered the bay. He</p><p>knew nothing of ships, but one was larger </p><p>than Lhe other two. </p><p> The first flash into his brain was that he</p><p>could get passage out on one of them. </p><p> He got up and hurried down to the beach,</p><p>and even he thought it strange that there </p><p>were so few natives in sight. When the </p><p>Mary had come in, the water was alive with </p><p>outriggers, and the beach crowded. Now </p><p>not only the beach but the village seemed </p><p>deserted. Here and there a little group of </p><p>natives stood watching, but that was all. </p><p> A boat was being rowed in from one of</p><p>the ships. </p><p> Gilbert Lang went out on the jetty’ built</p><p>of coral rocks that ran some distance out </p><p>to deep water, and there he waited. </p><p> As the boat made for the jetty, he could</p><p>see that it contained three white men be- </p><p>sides the black boys at the oars. </p><p> “What the-’s the matter?” a roaring</p><p>voice called at him some fifty yards from </p><p>the landing as the boat came on. </p><p> “Nothing,” he shouted back.</p><p> Gilbert Lang soon thought—and never</p><p>afterward changed his opinion—that the </p><p>burly, short-legged man with the great </p><p>roaring voice was the most profane individ- </p><p>ual on earth. </p><p> Jeb Jackson never spoke without swear-</p><p>ing. If one undertook to set down his </p><p>remarks literally, the account would re- </p><p>semble nothing that ever got into print; </p><p>and to indicate the censored oaths would be </p><p>to scar the pages with unending dots and </p><p>dashes. </p><p> His next remark, set down as near as one</p><p>dares, was: </p><p> “Then why the - - ain’t these</p><p>---niggers down at the - </p><p>beach? And who the--are you?” </p><p> The boat, skilfully guided by the white</p><p>man, who steered with an oar, slipped </p><p>alongside, missing the rocks by the width </p><p>of a lady’s hand, and Jeb Jackson leaped </p><p>to the jetty before the other men in </p><p>the boat had even steadied themselves </p><p>upright. </p><p> “My name is Gilbert La—”</p><p> “Gilbert, eh?” said Jackson, looking</p><p>him over critically. “Well, Gilbert, I’m </p><p>giad to meet you.” </p><p> And he thrust out a hand like a lumpy,</p><p>knotted ham. </p><p> “What you doin’ here? Trader? Look</p><p>more like a stray globe-trotter. WTiat’re </p><p>the niggers doin’, fattenin’ you up? And </p><p>what’s the matter with these spit images </p><p>of Satan? Want trouble, do they? They’ll </p><p>get it. Yes, son, they’ll get it. Why </p><p>ain’t they down here beggin’ tobacco </p><p>and try in’ to trade smoked copra for new </p><p>rifles? WTiat’s wrong?</p><p> “Hey, you fellow, come quick. Me</p><p>fellow gammon you. Hurry up for the </p><p>love of Judas Priest. Why you fellows no </p><p>here? Want temback? Come here—’’and </p><p>Jeb Jackson let go of a spurt of profanity </p><p>that almost gave the air a sulfur odor as he </p><p>Ii8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>shouted at the lone figure of a withered old </p><p>native who came slowly, hesitatingly along </p><p>the jetty. </p><p> Jackson liked to talk, or at least he</p><p>seemed to like it. He always did most of </p><p>it, aud there was scant chance of any one </p><p>interrupting him, for his was the booming </p><p>voice of an old-time mate, who, in addition </p><p>to a leather throat, had a barrel-like chest. </p><p>WHILE he was talking, the two </p><p>other white men, both heavily </p><p>armed, climbed on the jetty and </p><p>stood curiously looking at Gilbert Lang. </p><p>One of these men was obviously a sailor, a </p><p>boatswain perhaps. The other was a man </p><p>who seemed almost as much out of place at </p><p>Gopassa as Gilbert. </p><p> He was rather thin and dark-hued, but</p><p>with die darkness and body of the Latin. </p><p>His eyes were black and cunning, and the </p><p>mouth wore an unconscious, wicked sneer. </p><p>He was neatly dressed in white duck and </p><p>wore a yachting cap. He carried a rifle </p><p>and wore two revolvers. The other man </p><p>was as heavily equipped. Jeb Jackson did </p><p>not have anything in the way of a weapon. </p><p> “Come here' you seventh son of the</p><p>mother of Satan,’’Jackson shoutedat the lone </p><p>native; then, changing to the pidgin English </p><p>used and understood throughout almost the </p><p>whole of the South Seas, he demanded again </p><p>that “you fellow'’ come closer. </p><p> Baraka cautiously edged nearer.</p><p> “DuBeque, this is Gilbert. Ain’t a</p><p>missionary', are you?” Jackson said, un- </p><p>dertaking to introduce the man in white </p><p>duck and at the same time make sure that </p><p>the boy was not one of those most dreaded </p><p>and hated persons in the islands. That is, </p><p>dreaded and hated by the men who sailed </p><p>with and for Willerby. The large ship </p><p>moored out in the bay was the Bcbe. </p><p> “Pleased to meet you,*’ said DuBeque</p><p>quickly, politely, perhaps influenced by </p><p>Gilbert Lang’s embarrassed but emphatic </p><p>denial that he was a missionary. </p><p> And in his momentary' confusion he</p><p>neglected to explain that his name was not </p><p>Gilbert but Gilbert Lang. </p><p> DuBeque talked with a soft and fluid</p><p>ease; words came from his tongue smooth as </p><p>dripping oil, and his voice was low-pitched, </p><p>almost melodious, but just a little too </p><p>unctuous. </p><p> While Jackson was trying to hold conver-</p><p>sation with the wily Baraka, DuBeque </p><p>pitched his voice low and in about thirty </p><p>confidential seconds explained that he and </p><p>his cousin were the guests of Winston </p><p>Willerby, who had quite a party on board - </p><p>a charmmg and lively party—and they had </p><p>not expected to find any white men at </p><p>Gopassa. They were very much puzzled </p><p>at the attitude of the* natives, for it was </p><p>unnatural and usually indicated hostile </p><p>intention for the natives to stay off the </p><p>water and beach when a ship came in. </p><p> DuBeque obviously said what he did in</p><p>the expectation that Gilbert would in turn </p><p>sjjeak of himself. </p><p> And Gilbert did. He had at first no</p><p>liking for DuBeque’s face, but DuBeque </p><p>seemed a gentleman. It was a pleasure to </p><p>hear English spoken fluently and quietly </p><p>again. And Gilbert was interested and </p><p>hopeful to learn that there was a party of </p><p>white people on the Bebe. He said that he </p><p>had'been traveling about with Hurricane </p><p>Williams, who came to Gopassa some weeks </p><p>before after pearls, and he could not imagine </p><p>what was the matter with the natives, for </p><p>they were certainly not hostile but friendly, </p><p>very friendly. </p><p> DuBeque scarcely heard the last of</p><p>Gilbert Lang’s septence. He hastily glided </p><p>forward and prodded Jacksdn into an al- </p><p>titude of attention, saying excitedly: </p><p>“Hurricane Williams is here. Pearling, </p><p>and Gilbert came with him. Williams </p><p>has stirred up the niggers, as usual.” </p><p>Jackson gave a questioning grunt and </p><p>stared at Gilbert Lang doubtfully. </p><p> “You come with Williams?”</p><p> Jackson seemed skeptical. Gilbert did</p><p>not look at all like the sort of a man Wil- </p><p>liams w'ould take up with. </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “So that tiger-shark is here? Pearling?</p><p>Funny fellow, that Williams, ain’t he?” </p><p>Jackson asked in a tone that passed for </p><p>low with him, but his voice rumbled like </p><p>distant thunder. </p><p> Gilbert readily admitted that Williams</p><p>was strange at times. </p><p> “So you say he’s got these niggers primed</p><p>for trouble with us, eh?” </p><p> “No, he didn’t say that,” DuBeque</p><p>hastily put in. “I did You know wher-</p><p>ever this beach-comber goes he makes </p><p>trouble for white men.” </p><p> “Does he now?” Jackson asked. There</p><p>was something peculiar in his manner of </p><p>asking it. </p><p>Savages </p><p>119 </p><p> “He’s notorious,” DuBeque insisted.</p><p> “Yes. Seems to me I’ve heard o’ him,”</p><p>said Jackson with a shade of irony in his </p><p>voice, and the irony, though lost to Du- </p><p>Beque’s cars, caught Gilbert Lang’s atten- </p><p>tion. </p><p> Jeb Jackson had formerly been mate on a</p><p>Yankee whaler. That was years ago. He </p><p>had beaten up a bullying, half-crazed skip- </p><p>per, then had taken to the beach and had </p><p>stayed in the South Seas ever since, eventu- </p><p>ally going into the employ of Winston </p><p>Willerby. </p><p> DuBeque swore viciously in his low, oily,</p><p>smooth way, and said there was not a decent </p><p>man in the South Seas who had not heard of </p><p>Williams. And said that he was a trouble- </p><p>maker. </p><p> “You’re right. You’re right, son,” Jack-</p><p>son answered casually. “He’s the greatest </p><p>little trouble-maker—an’ finisher—in these </p><p>parts. Old W. W. ought to be quite inter- </p><p>ested. He’s wished ’nough times he could </p><p>run across him.” </p><p> “By the way, Gilbert,” DuBeque asked</p><p>quickly, “come back with us to the ship? </p><p>I want to introduce you to Willerby. </p><p>Fine fellow to know. Will you?” </p><p> “I shall be pleased,” said Gilbert Lang.</p><p> Jackson grunted. He knew Paul Du-</p><p>Beque and why DuBeque wanted to carry </p><p>Gilbert back to the ship, where he and </p><p>Willerby could question him about Wil- </p><p>liams. </p><p> “Hey, you, below there!” Jackson shouted</p><p>down at the boat. “Throw up that </p><p>raffle.” </p><p> The “raffle” was odds and ends of trade</p><p>goods, which the black boys threw up to </p><p>Jackson. He had brought presents for the </p><p>village, but, as none other than Baraka ap- </p><p>proached, Jackson generously presented the </p><p>whole lot to him. Jackson was not a </p><p>trader. He was a seaman. Willerby was </p><p>a goods eaman himself when sober, but he </p><p>kept Jackson near him and gave him the </p><p>hard and dangerous work to do—as going </p><p>ashore to a village that appeared hostile. </p><p> Paul DuBeque was a man after Willerby’s</p><p>heart. He had known Paul for years. </p><p>Also he had known Paul’s cousin—Lania—</p><p>pronounced La-nigh-a—DuBeque. Some </p><p>months before there had been trouble be- </p><p>tween Willerby and the DuBeques, and the </p><p>latter fled into hiding, but recently every- </p><p>thing had been patched over and the old </p><p>relations resumed. </p><p> Gilbert Lang got into the boat, and, when</p><p>it shoved away from the jetty, he wished </p><p>that he might never again set foot on that </p><p>island. He expected to, however. He was </p><p>going on board the Bebe with no intention </p><p>of not returning. He was beginning rather </p><p>to like DuBeque, who was more friendly and </p><p>courteous than any other man met since </p><p>leaving Honolulu. And Jackson, too, in </p><p>spite of profanity, seemed to be only a big, </p><p>"hale, hearty fellow. But Gilbert Lang </p><p>sensed that Jackson had a kind of veiled </p><p>contempt for DuBeque. </p><p>V </p><p>HTHE Bebe was moored a hundred </p><p>and fifty yards from the jetty and </p><p>within shouting distance of one of </p><p>the luggers. </p><p> An awning that served to keep away rain</p><p>or sun was stretched over the poop. A </p><p>six-pound brass cannon with a carriage that </p><p>could be run to port or starboard was in </p><p>the waist. This was ostensibly for pro- </p><p>tection, but Winston WTillerby occasionally </p><p>took upon himself the prerogatives of Euro- </p><p>pean men-of-war and shelled a village. In </p><p>those days and until recently, very re- </p><p>cently, if a white man got killed or hurt in </p><p>a coast village—no matter why or how— </p><p>and a war-ship happened to come along, </p><p>even months afterward, the village was </p><p>shelled to show the savages that they could </p><p>not trifle with the lives of civilized men. </p><p> Willerby was a big man in many a way.</p><p>He really was. He had a genius for trade, </p><p>for commerce, and what he may have lacked </p><p>in attention to details and good manage- </p><p>ment he made up in jealously keeping </p><p>rivals from the field. He was a large- </p><p>bodied man with a shaven red face, a heavy- </p><p>jowled face, and gray eyes. His magnifi- </p><p>cence was unapproached in the South </p><p>Seas, in Australia even. The Bebe was a </p><p>beautiful ship and a floating palace. Wil- </p><p>lerby made money and spent it, and not </p><p>the least of his expenditures were for food </p><p>and drink. The chef on the Bebe had been </p><p>drawn by Willerby’s princely wage from a </p><p>passenger-steamer. Her immense refriger- </p><p>ator was stored with ice. Rumor had it </p><p>that Willerby every six months had a ship- </p><p>load of ice brought to his plantation in the</p><p>Fijis. </p><p> Willerby spent most of his time at sea</p><p>and in good company. He kept a small </p><p>120 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>orchestra that furnished music for the </p><p>nightly dance, for, now that he was in </p><p>wealth and influence—if not officially—a </p><p>king, he never hailed without companions, </p><p>a half dozen or more guests. Trading- </p><p>s tat ions were to be visited, the Australian </p><p>markets investigated and the footholds of </p><p>independent traders to be jarred loose. </p><p> He combined business with pleasure and</p><p>carried new stocks for his traders, took on </p><p>board the contents of their warehouses, </p><p>was ever ready to carry out any new scheme </p><p>that had money in it. And pearling had a </p><p>peculiar fascination for him, not only be- </p><p>cause the shell was valuable but because he </p><p>seemed to have a genuine passion for pearls. </p><p>He had luggers at Thursday Island and a </p><p>schooner that every year visited Paumotu </p><p>reefs. Any one who reported a new oyster- </p><p>bed coidd always gain his ear. </p><p> The sun disappeared with almost the</p><p>suddenness of being swallowed by some </p><p>black cosmic monster .that lurked near the </p><p>western horizon just as the boat bearing </p><p>Gilbert Lang approached the Bcbe, but her </p><p>poop was ablaze with lanterns, and the </p><p>shadowy shapes of men and women could </p><p>be seen through the rays of the lanterns; </p><p>voices raised in laughter and bantering </p><p>could be heard far out on the water. </p><p> Gilbert Lang followed DuBeque up the</p><p>sea-ladder and to the poop. After them </p><p>came the burly, barrel body of Jackson. </p><p> Gilbert Lang’s first impression was of</p><p>some attractive though unreal world into </p><p>which he had been thrown. Two white- </p><p>coated Chinese boys moved about on noise- </p><p>less feet with trays and glasses in which </p><p>the tinkling of ice wras heard. Women, </p><p>beautiful w'omen, white w'omen, in brilliant </p><p>gowns and jewels—scarcely less resplendent </p><p>in the lantern-light than if they all had been </p><p>genuine—were grouped about men in pressed </p><p>duck suits. </p><p> The soft lights took much of the hardness</p><p>from the faces that he saw'. The honest </p><p>sun would have shown him that there was </p><p>not a face there unmarked with a kind of </p><p>cunning or without the scars of sin: no face </p><p>but one, and hers was beautiful in the way </p><p>that the evilest of women’s often are for </p><p>some few years. </p><p> Lania DuBeque had the flashing bizarre</p><p>face that lures even the wise, the unillu- </p><p>sioned, to folly. Some men, many in fact, </p><p>might be sufficiently inexpert in character </p><p>perception to believe her words and pose </p><p>when she assumed a certain innocence </p><p>Others, most others, might know all there </p><p>was to knowr about her and yet not care. </p><p>Hei voice, too, was soft and smooth; sw'eet </p><p>and plausible her words—unless she spoke </p><p>in anger, when a fishwife might well have </p><p>shrunk. </p><p> She sat in a chair, a long wicker chair, and</p><p> by her sat Winston Willerby.</p><p> I hough it could at once be perceived that</p><p> she l-Hjre a family resemblance to DuBeque,</p><p> still she did not have either his eyes or his</p><p> mouth Her face was not regular in the</p><p> 1 lassical fashion. The faces of fascinating wo-</p><p> men never are. In such faces there is a unique</p><p> irregularity that first arrests the surprized</p><p> attention; then the beholder more or less</p><p> swiftly is likely to come under the spell of</p><p> her serpentine personality. There seems</p><p> to be something serpentine, wicked, about</p><p> all really fascinating women.</p><p> “Hurricane Williams is over there!”</p><p> DuBeque shouted breathlessly to Willerby.</p><p> The people about the deck drew near to</p><p> listen. Most of them stared at Gilbert</p><p> Lang, stared in that curious noncommital</p><p> way that leaves people free to accept the</p><p> stranger as a comrade or a spoil-sport.</p><p> But their stares were not long nor steady.</p><p> Most of them looked at DuBeque, who was</p><p> very much excited, and some of them who</p><p> knew of Hurricane Williams glanced re-</p><p> peatedly at Willerby to see how he was</p><p> taking DuBeque’s information.</p><p>9^9 BUT Lania did not take her eyes </p><p>off Gilbert Lang’s face. From un- </p><p>der her long lashes she watched him </p><p>steadily. Two long pendant black pearls </p><p>were at her ears—not pear-shaped pearls, </p><p>but baroques that had been matched with </p><p>some care and a great deal of luck. Any </p><p>one finding a large, shield-like baroque </p><p>would never expect to find its mate, and the </p><p>chances would be infinitely reduced if the </p><p>baroque were black. 'Tis an old saying, </p><p>and true; j&gt;erhaps old as the pearl-fishers of </p><p>Arabian w’aters from whence were drawn </p><p>pearls of great price for Solomon, “Match </p><p>a pearl, and you double the value of both." </p><p> Those pendant earrings were without</p><p> price. They could not be purchased.</p><p> Many women had worn them. They were,</p><p> in a wav, the tiara of Willerby’s court. If</p><p> a herald had cried it forth in a stentorian</p><p> voice, it would not have been better known</p><p> that the woman who wore them was not to</p><p>Savages </p><p>121 </p><p> receive attention from other men: it would</p><p> be perilous for her and for the men. Lania</p><p> had first worn those earrings a year and</p><p> more before and the eldest son of a lord</p><p> had fallen in love with her. Lania and</p><p> Paul DuBeque fled. The lord was notified</p><p> by letter that reached to his English</p><p> manor house that his son and heir had been</p><p> hauled under by sharks.</p><p> Gilbert Lang did not notice how she was</p><p>watching him. He, too, was listening to </p><p>DuBeque and looking again and again </p><p>at Willerby. </p><p> “He’s trying to make trouble. Look at</p><p>the way the natives act! And pearling on </p><p>your grounds! Here is the chance to catch </p><p>that pirate. He—” indicating Gilbert— </p><p>“can give you the details,” DuBeque con- </p><p>cluded. </p><p> Willerby’s fingers opened and shut writh-</p><p>ingly on the arms of the chair, and liis face </p><p>grew red and more red with apoplectic rage. </p><p>He looked Gilbert up and down and through </p><p>him, too. Willerby was something of a </p><p>judge of men. He sometimes said that </p><p>none were to be trusted, which is a common </p><p>opinion among men of large financial </p><p>affairs, but still he had had to pick his </p><p>traders, his agents and managers. He </p><p>knew some tiling of men, and he was trying </p><p>to comprehend what that frail boy with the </p><p>refined, not quite matured, face was doing </p><p>with W’illiams. </p><p> “So you’re in with him. are you?”</p><p>Willerby said hoarsely, menacingly. </p><p> “No,” said Gilbert Lang; “I took pas-</p><p>sage with him out of the Carolines. I </p><p>know nothing about his business. He said </p><p>he was an outlaw, and he has influence with </p><p>the natives, and he is pearl-fishing. That </p><p>is about all I know of him.” </p><p> Now Gilbert Lang spoke the truth, and</p><p>he was glad that he could say that and know </p><p>it was true. He had no love for Williams, </p><p>though a certain exasperating admiration— </p><p>much like the charm of Uala—rose from </p><p>time to time. But just at that moment, </p><p>or rather afternoon and evening, he was </p><p>glad to be able to say that they were not </p><p>closely associated, scarcely acquaintances, </p><p>certainly not friends. </p><p> A heavy guttural grunt rolled up from</p><p>the chest of Jackson, who had been standing </p><p>impassively near-by.</p><p> Gilbert Lang glanced at him. Jackson said</p><p>nothing; he merely looked back at Gilbert </p><p>Lang. But the look made the boy angry </p><p>with Jackson, angry with himself, angry </p><p>with Williams. The huge sailor seemed </p><p>silently expressing contempt for one who </p><p>denied his friend. </p><p> Now Gilbert Lang did not consider</p><p>Williams his friend. He said so. He said </p><p>so to Willerby, but it was for Jackson that </p><p>he spoke. And every second Lania’s steady- </p><p>dark eyes, peering alertly from under </p><p>slumbrous lids, were on him. </p><p> “I’m glad to know' that. Glad to know</p><p>that, boy,” said W'illerby, who believed </p><p>him. </p><p> Willerby spoke not in a hospitable man-</p><p>ner but ratlier as a judge who has dis- </p><p>covered that the suspected person is inno- </p><p>cent of everything but bad company. </p><p> “But what are you doin’ down here?</p><p>Tell me that.” </p><p> Gilbert Lang was impaled by that ques-</p><p>tion. Willerby required an answer. He </p><p>assumed the right to know the wrherefore </p><p>and wrhy of every man's presence if there </p><p>was the remote chance of it interfering with </p><p>the Willerby interests. Gilbert Lang </p><p>could no more tell his story than he could </p><p>have been gratuitously insulting. The </p><p>rebuke that Williams had given him when </p><p>he had ventured to mention the tragedy back </p><p>of his request had left a scar deep within </p><p>him, and, besides, here were many ears, </p><p>none of them sympathetic. But Gilbert </p><p>Lang could not pose as a trader or a scien- </p><p>tist or any of those tilings. </p><p> “Mr. Willerby,” he said, “I came dowm</p><p>to the South Seas to rather look around, </p><p>and I didn’t have the faintest idea that it </p><p>w’as nearly as large as it is. I wouldn't </p><p>wrant to call myself an ‘adventurer’, but </p><p>that is about the nearest to it.” </p><p> “Has Williams been gettin’ pearls?”</p><p> “Not that I know of.”</p><p> “He’s got that gang of niggers with him,</p><p>hasn’t he?” </p><p> “Samoans and Tongans.”</p><p> “By - I’ll get him and get him to-</p><p>night!” Willerby cried, springing up and </p><p>not wholly unconscious of the dramatic </p><p>value of his words and manner. </p><p> He was angry, but he was not too beside</p><p>himself to note the admiring murmurs and </p><p>eyes of his guests—if such a parasitical lot </p><p>could be called by that ancient and honor- </p><p>able name. </p><p> “We’ll steal a march on him,” Willerby</p><p>went on, interrupting the statement of his </p><p>intentions at this point to curse the soul </p><p>122 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and body of Williams. Then: “Jackson, </p><p>you take what men you need. No lights, </p><p>understand. Land on the beach. This </p><p>boy’ll go along and show you the way. </p><p>Grab him and get back before his niggers </p><p>know you have him. I want to tell that </p><p>fellow to his face what I think of him; </p><p>then-” </p><p> Willerby ended abruptly with a signifi-</p><p>cant sweep of his arm that suggested push- </p><p>ing somebody overboard into the black </p><p>water. </p><p> “I’ll make your fortune for you,” he</p><p>said to the horrified boy. “From this day </p><p>on Winston Willerby is behind you. And </p><p>that means something down in this country. </p><p>Don’t it?” </p><p> His question was an appeal to those who</p><p>stood about him, and emphatic words </p><p>flashing hastily from male and female </p><p>throats, many of them loud words so that </p><p>he might be sure which throat had spoken, </p><p>agreed that it meant much: it was the great- </p><p>est thing that could happen to a man in the </p><p>South Seas. Some of the women cast </p><p>speculating glances at Gilbert Lang. He </p><p>had suddenly become worth while. </p><p> Only Lania DuBeque remained silent.</p><p>She was above such flattery. Hers was </p><p>more subtle. Besides, she was sure of her </p><p>position on board the Bebe or at the home </p><p>plantation in the Fijis. But not for one </p><p>second did she take her eyes off Gilbert </p><p>Lang. There was something about the </p><p>boy that more than interested her—almost </p><p>disturbed her. She could not tell what it </p><p>was. </p><p> “Well,” Willerby continued, in the large</p><p>way that a man may assume when by a </p><p>smile or a frown he has the power to affect </p><p>the fortunes of others, ^‘you’re in with </p><p>Winston Willerby from now on. Just go </p><p>along with Jackson here and point out </p><p>that--’s hut, and Jackson and his </p><p>men’ll do the rest.” </p><p> Now Gilbert Lang had found Williams a</p><p>peculiarly unfriendly man and disagreeable </p><p>as well as at times terrifying. The boy had </p><p>been born into a home and raised in sur- </p><p>roundings where a very deep and sincere </p><p>religious feeling existed. Williams had </p><p>been constantly blasphemous. More even </p><p>than that, Williams had on one horrible </p><p>occasion said that he would not crook a</p><p>finger to stop a cannibal feast. He had </p><p>many reasons for disliking as well as fearing </p><p>Williams, and few were known for liking him. </p><p> True, he had awakened out of his feverish</p><p>delirium to find himself in Williams* hut </p><p>and hammock, but Gilbert Lang knew </p><p>nothing of Williams’ vigils, his unremitting </p><p>attention. He knew 110 more of those </p><p>things than of Lula’s gift of her precious </p><p>knife to Baraka as the price for exorcising </p><p>the devil out of him. It was natural that </p><p>Gilbert Lang would, almost invariably, </p><p>mistake discourtesy—such as was con- </p><p>tinuous in Williams—for a kind of re- </p><p>pulsiveness of character. </p><p> He did not feel the jiersonal loyalty of</p><p>the comrade for Williams, and, being very </p><p>young, as well as more or less unconsciously </p><p>eager to tell something—to give information </p><p>—which is an impulse by no means re- </p><p>stricted to the youthful—he had been un- </p><p>aware of the ugly sound his words had had </p><p>when he disclaimed all knowledge of Wil- </p><p>liams’ business and all friendship for him. </p><p> But Willerby’s suggestion smote Gilbert</p><p>Lang as an insult would have done. In a </p><p>way it was an insult To deny friendship </p><p>for Williams was one thing: to deliver him </p><p>into the hands of the unfriendly was another. </p><p> “Mr. Willerby,” he said, his voice trem-</p><p>bling from the effort to remain calm, “I </p><p>could not think of doing such a thing as </p><p>you propose!” </p><p>THERE was silence about the deck </p><p>as those unexpected words fell from </p><p>his lips. Willerby looked at him; </p><p>just looked, as a monarch might stare at </p><p>some poor fool who had done an incom- </p><p>prehensible thing. DuBeque’s evil lips </p><p>I&gt;arted in a kind of amazed gasp. Jeb </p><p>Jackson slipped his thumbs into his belt, </p><p>leaned against the railing and sort of re- </p><p>laxed into the attitude of a spectator. </p><p>Jackson’s face was heavily bearded; so no </p><p>one could detect the sort of a smile that ran </p><p>along his mouth. Lania DuBeque nar- </p><p>rowed her eyes and leaned slightly forward. </p><p> Then Willerby cut loose. He cursed the</p><p>boy with a boatswain’s tongue, accused him </p><p>of being a Williams spy, of the same breed </p><p>and ilk as that thrice-damnable thief and </p><p>white cannibal, as well as an ingrate! For </p><p>wasn’t he, Willerby, about to make his, </p><p>Gilbert Lang’s, fortune? And that was the </p><p>manner of his repay! </p><p> “Jackson,” he concluded, “throw him</p><p>into irons! He’ll never get off this ship </p><p>again—alive!”</p><p> Then it was that Lania DuBeque gasped.</p><p>Savages </p><p>123 </p><p>Her black eyes, suddenly fierce, shifted to </p><p>Willerby’s face, and she put out a hand as </p><p>if tc protest. But the hand fell again </p><p>to the arm of her chair. She lay back and </p><p>kept silent, watching Gilbert Lang in- </p><p>tently. </p><p> The boy, slender, pale with anger, con-</p><p>fused by the injustice, stared at Willerby. </p><p>Willerby was furious, but Gilbert Lang </p><p>thought such an order must at most be </p><p>only a threat. Men did not do such things! </p><p> But Jackson, taking a half dozen steps</p><p>forward, called from the poop for Grogan, </p><p>the.third mate, and Grogan came. </p><p> “Irons. An’ drop him down the for-</p><p>ward hatch,” said Jackson carelessly with </p><p>a gesture toward Gilbert Lang. </p><p> “Git!” cried DuBeque, ever anxious in</p><p>some distinguishing way to aid the wishes </p><p>of Willerby, as he gave the boy a shove and </p><p>kicked him. </p><p> Gilbert Lang wheeled and leaped. He</p><p>smote the fastidious DuBeque on Lhe mouth </p><p>anci whirled another fist to the jaw. The </p><p>dormant blood of his fighting forefathers </p><p>who had raised to prestige the name of </p><p>Lang was foaming in his veins. Again, as </p><p>among the raiding bushmen, he knew no </p><p>fear and had no thought of it. Injustice set </p><p>him wild. Wrillerby’s order to throw him </p><p>into irons had made him like a barrel of </p><p>dry powder, but it was DuBeque who ap- </p><p>plied the match. </p><p> Lauia DuBeque sprang to her feet and</p><p>drew back. She did not cry out. Others </p><p>were doing that. </p><p> The fight was short. Its length was</p><p>scarcely countable in seconds. It was not </p><p>really a fight, for Paul DuBeque did noth- </p><p>ing but scream and try to protect himself </p><p>by bending down and covering his face. </p><p> When Jackson, profanity flowing from</p><p>his bearded mouth, reached out a powerful, </p><p>deliberate arm and gripped Gilbert Lang, </p><p>then DuBeque remembered the revolvers </p><p>at his side and snatched at them. </p><p> WiLh feline swiftness Lania pushed him</p><p>to one side, crying— </p><p> “You fool!”</p><p> Willerby was storming and ordering all</p><p>manner of terrible things at once to be done </p><p>Jo Gilbert Lang—whose name he even did </p><p>not know, had not heard. </p><p> But Jackson, half pushing and half</p><p>carrying the boy down the poop ladder</p><p>t urned him over to Grogan. </p><p> “Put him somewhere so W. W. don’t</p><p>stumble across him. Stick him some place </p><p>—to keep him from ’scaping—an’ DuBeque </p><p>from knifin’ him,” said Jackson to Grogan </p><p>in a whisper. </p><p> Then aloud with lurid oaths he roared for</p><p>Grogan to make Gilbert Lang lament the </p><p>day of his birth and that he had never </p><p>learned manners enough not to strike </p><p>gentlemen in the face. </p><p> “A-r-r-right!” said Grogan hoarsely and</p><p>fiercely, jerking the struggling, dazed boy </p><p>along as easily as a man might pull a frail </p><p>child. </p><p> Willerby was beside himself. He was</p><p>often beside himself. But familiarity with </p><p>his rage did not breed contempt in those </p><p>who lived on the ship with him. True, </p><p>Lania DuBeque had a way of seeming un- </p><p>impressed. But, if there was something </p><p>of the roaring bull in him. there was a good </p><p>deal of the tiger in her. Probably no other </p><p>woman would ever have returned as she </p><p>did to face Willerby’s jealous rage when she </p><p>had fled it; possibly she was ashamed of </p><p>herself for having fled, and that was why </p><p>she returned. </p><p> Too, she may have been aware of her</p><p>charms and confident. It is the conscious- </p><p>ness of beauty, not of brains, that makes </p><p>women daring in that picaresque, sensa- </p><p>tional way that frequently startles not only </p><p>communities but nations. </p><p> As Willerby stamped the deck and</p><p>stormed, all but Lania and Paul DuBeque </p><p>drew respectfully away from him. Du- </p><p>Beque, presuming somewhat on his bat- </p><p>tered face, solicitiously felt of his swollen </p><p>lips, and a finger with a delicate touch ran </p><p>along his jawr to see if it wTere really broken. </p><p> “Take the crews off the luggers and every</p><p>man off the Bcbc and go get that fellow </p><p>W'illiams!” Willerby shouted at Jackson. </p><p>“Bring him here! I’ll tend to him! I'll </p><p>show him that Winston Willerby can’t </p><p>be made a fool of. Send that girlish kid </p><p>here as a spy, will he? By - 1*11 cut </p><p>his eyes out and use ’em for fish-bait! Do </p><p>you hear me?” </p><p> “Yes,” Jackson rumbled. “I hear you.</p><p>But-” </p><p> “But what?” Willerby demanded im-</p><p>patiently. </p><p> “We can muster about ten white men.”</p><p>He paused to let his eyes sweep the guests </p><p>in the background, who. though white men </p><p>—and women—were not included in the</p><p>muster. “And Williams—he ain’t called </p><p>I24 </p><p>Advent ure </p><p>a ‘Hurricane’ 'cause he has a windy mouth, </p><p>either—is the best rifle-shot ’tween here an’ </p><p>hell an’ has a hundred niggers, too.” </p><p>“You’re afraid!” Willerby sneered. </p><p>“LET me go, W. W.? I’ll bring </p><p>him!” said DuBeque speaking with </p><p>effort at articulation because of his </p><p>swollen lips. </p><p> But, at the same time as he spoke, Paul</p><p>DuBeque assumed what he thought was an </p><p>attitude of utter exhaustion and physical </p><p>debility which a courageous fighting-spirit </p><p>was trying to overcome. He was pretty </p><p>confident that Willerby would tell him to </p><p>go to bed instead. DuBeque’s histrionics </p><p>were not lost on anybody but Willerby. </p><p>They all played the same game of flattery, </p><p>sympathy and pose and were jealous when </p><p>one was more successful than the others. </p><p>All. that is, of Willerby’s guests and social </p><p>associates. </p><p> “Hear that,” said Willerby in rising anger</p><p>to Jackson. “This boy’s willing to do it. An’ </p><p>you're afraid. You give me excuses-” </p><p> “Let him,” said Jackson, whose temper</p><p>was like touchwood anyway and whose </p><p>respect for DuBeque was only to be re- </p><p>presented by a minus quantity. </p><p> For Willerby he did have respect and a</p><p>certain, though not exaggerated, liking. </p><p>Willerby had faults, and of late years was </p><p>given to wanton overbearing, but he was a </p><p>bold, ruthless fellow and, if cruel, not with- </p><p>out courage. </p><p> “Let him,” Jackson repeated. “An’, if</p><p>Williams ever starts for him, he’ll think he’s </p><p>tangled up with a couple o’ bolts o’ light- </p><p>ning. Now listen, W. W. I know this fel- </p><p>low Williams. I don’t simply know of </p><p>him, like the rest o’ you. I know him. </p><p>When I was a young fellow in the States, I </p><p>went out West to what they called cow- </p><p>towns and mining-camps. An’ this fellow </p><p>Williams is what them people ’d call a </p><p>killer'. You send a gang over there alter </p><p>him, an’ some o’ us may come back, an’ </p><p>some won’t, an’ you won’t be no nearer to </p><p>Williams than you are now. </p><p> “He’s not over there asleep. I’ll bet he’s</p><p>got black boys' with rifles squatting all </p><p>along back of the beach, an’ at the first </p><p>whoop out o’ him all - ’11 break loose. </p><p>I’m not afraid o’ him or no man, but I </p><p>don’t wrant to commit suicide.” </p><p> Jackson could have told, had he chosen—</p><p>but he never told any one—that his intro- </p><p>duction to Williams had been swift and </p><p>painful. Jackson, for scarcely more of a </p><p>reason than that he was half-drunk and </p><p>hard-fisted, had once upon a time knocked </p><p>down a black boy on a beach, when there </p><p>suddenly appeared a man, half-mated, </p><p>seemingly scarcely more than half of Jack- </p><p>son's size. Jackson's shipmates were </p><p>ashore and around him; they had laughed </p><p>when he liit the nigger. </p><p> “Apologize to that boy,” said the strange</p><p>white man, in a strange quiet, tense way </p><p>as the moaning native rose fearfully and </p><p>unsteadily. </p><p> Jackson’s reply was what any one might</p><p>expect it to have been. </p><p> The answer of the strange white man was</p><p>most unexpected. </p><p> When Jackson somewhat recovered con-</p><p>sciousness, after passing through a sort of </p><p>blurred haze of bumps and blows, he had </p><p>raised himself from the sand and saw the </p><p>man and native walking off together while </p><p>his own shipmates stood in a kind of silent </p><p>wonder, watching. </p><p> Jackson cursed them for their inaction</p><p>that they should so go back on a shipmate </p><p>as to let the fellow get away. </p><p> “That’s Hurricane Williams,” said a</p><p>grizzly old harpooner who had been much </p><p>in those waters. </p><p> “An’, if you don’t want 'im t’ git awye,”</p><p>said an English sailor, “just shout fer im </p><p>to come byke. ’E’ll come ha-runninV </p><p> In the three or four years since that</p><p>Jackson had not met him again or mentioned </p><p>their first introduction. He had heard </p><p>much of Williams, of his amazing suddenness </p><p>and strength, his readiness to fight or to </p><p>kill, of his cunning and boldness. </p><p> “Don’t want to commit suicide?” Wil-</p><p>lerby repeated contemptuously. “DuBeque, </p><p>take what men you want and bring that </p><p>fellow here—alive!” </p><p>Willerby said it with a majestic flourish. </p><p>He laid his hand on DuBeque’s shoulder as </p><p>a king might lay an accolade on some </p><p>obscure soldiet who was being raised to the </p><p>post of honor and danger abandoned by a </p><p>craven captain. But the dramatic climax </p><p>was close to being ruined by something </p><p>resembling a snicker that ran thfough the </p><p>group, and DuBeque’s knees threatened to </p><p>give way beneath his amazement. Even </p><p>Lania smiled understanding^ and not </p><p>without enjoyment. </p><p> Jackson was a good sailor and in those</p><p>Savages </p><p>125 </p><p>largely ill-charted or uncharted waters as </p><p>good a navigator as Willerby could expect </p><p>to find in combination with a certain un- </p><p>scrupulousness and close-mouthed loyalty. </p><p>He valued the last as much as seamanship, </p><p>and so Jackson often presumed upon that </p><p>value, as in the instance of his refusal to </p><p>try kidnaping Hurricane Williams. </p><p> DuBeque, having bluffed, realised well</p><p>enough that it was ruinous not to pretend </p><p>at least to be proud and make the effort. </p><p> Some of the things which DuBeque may</p><p>have lacked in courage he replaced with </p><p>cunning. </p><p> ‘TU go alone,” he said. “Just let me</p><p>have enough men to row the boat.” </p><p> There probably was not a person who</p><p>heard him, excepting Willerby, who did </p><p>not believe that DuBeque rejected com- </p><p>panions so there would be no witnesses to </p><p>deny the story he could tell by way of ex- </p><p>plaining his failure. And that is probably </p><p>exactly what DuBeque at first had in mind. </p><p> “Hear that., Jackson? This lad is going</p><p>alone. Or willing to. I won’t allow it, </p><p>Paul. No. Take fifty or a hundred men. </p><p>By-we’ll all go!” </p><p> It made no difference that Willerby could</p><p>not possibly have mustered a hundred men; </p><p>he was given to speaking in large numbers. </p><p> But DuBeque protested, and his pro-</p><p>tests were sincere. He said that many </p><p>would attract attention and they would </p><p>have the whole villages and Williams’ </p><p>natives on them in the darkness. He be- </p><p>lieved he could manage alone better. Just </p><p>get the boat ready and give him time to </p><p>wash up a little. A vague idea of what he </p><p>might be able to do had come to him. </p><p> And he walked to the companion way</p><p>with the conscious importance of a hero. </p><p> Willerby was pleased with him, said</p><p>things of praise, and others had to agree </p><p>readily with the compliments. </p><p> Lania slipped away unnoticed and follow-</p><p>ed DuBeque, coming into his cabin as he </p><p>stood with a wash-rag in hand before a </p><p>mirror. </p><p> “I'm proud of you, Paul. Proud of you,”</p><p>she said sweetly and suiting her expression </p><p>to the words. </p><p> He took the words as a hungry shark takes</p><p>pork. </p><p> “I’ll show that bunch of cheaps! I</p><p>know what they’ve all been saying. They’re </p><p>crazy with jealousy since we got in so good</p><p>with W. W. again.” </p><p> “Oh, those cats and snakes! Does it</p><p>hurt much?” she asked with am appearance </p><p>of tenderness, coming closer and letting a </p><p>sinuous arm slip around his waist. </p><p> “How’d you like to have your face</p><p>battered up! Say, and why’d you stop me </p><p>when I was going to kill that fellow?” </p><p> There was a touch of menace in the</p><p>question. </p><p> “Paul!” she exclaimed injuredly. “And</p><p>when you know how all those people hate </p><p>us—and if something should happen to </p><p>Willerby? You wouldn’t have had a </p><p>chance before the British Commissioner. </p><p>They’d have sworn it was cold-blooded </p><p>murder. There would have been seven or </p><p>eight against just us two. You must </p><p>think of such things.” </p><p> He was thoughtful for a moment. Lania’s</p><p>reasoning was a little far-fetched but </p><p>plausible enough if one admitted that some- </p><p>thing might happen to W illerby. </p><p> “Nothing will happen to him!”</p><p> “Let us hope not! But you can’t tell.</p><p>He’s drinking hard. And this Williams-” </p><p> “Leave that fellow to me,” he said</p><p>mysteriously. </p><p> “But W. W. said he wanted him alive!”</p><p>“Don’t worry. He’ll be alive. But that </p><p>Gilbert—he won’t long!” </p><p> “What did you say his name was?” she</p><p>asked quickly. </p><p> “Gilbert. I’m going to stick a knife in</p><p>him.” </p><p> “Gilbert? Gilbert. Mr. Gilbert,” she</p><p>repeated thoughtfully. </p><p> There was something about the boy but</p><p>nothing about the name that stirred vague </p><p>things somewhere in Lania’s brain. He </p><p>was a beautiful, poised, refined boy such as </p><p>few women of the far places have ever met. </p><p>“Who is he?” she asked. </p><p> “1 don’t know. And I don’t care. lean</p><p>tell you what he’ll be in less ’an a week, if </p><p>that’ll interest you. A corpse!” </p><p> Lania, motionless, looked at him from the</p><p>comers of her eyes. </p><p> “Say,” he flashed at her, turning from</p><p>the mirror, “and you’ve got to hit it up </p><p>harder. You’ve been cold as an icicle round </p><p>W. W. lately. Beginning to be again like you </p><p>were just before you met Ballantyne.” </p><p>Ballantyne was the eldest son of the </p><p>English lord who, so liis father had been </p><p>told, was pulled down by a shark. </p><p> “If I drank like the rest of those cats, I’d</p><p>soon look like them,” she said, at once</p><p>126 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>explaining and evading his remark. “I have </p><p>to keep my head and face. I don’t wear </p><p>these—” touching the black pearl pendants </p><p>—“because I go to bed drunk every morn- </p><p>ing.” </p><p> “You take care not to pull any more fool</p><p>plays. I’m in good with Willerby now, and </p><p>I'm not going to lose out for you or any- </p><p>body.” </p><p> “ You wouldn’t throw me to the sharks,</p><p>would you, Paul?” she asked with just a </p><p>perceptible trace of lightness. </p><p> The question was at once figurative and</p><p>literal. </p><p> “No,” he replied with frank irony, dab-</p><p>bing his swollen face with ointment, “I </p><p>wouldn’t throw you overboard any sooner </p><p>than you’d throw me. All along you’ve </p><p>been the one that was in good and me just </p><p>hanging on by my eyelashes. But I’m </p><p>solid now, and after tonight—you can all </p><p>go to-if you don ’ t like my ways. W. W. </p><p>won’t forget in a hurry who brought this </p><p>Huricane Williams on board.” </p><p> There was some truth in that. Much.</p><p>Lania had no love for Paul—no more than </p><p>he had for her. But down deep in her </p><p>heart she was afraid of him. She always </p><p>had been afraid of him. And he was far </p><p>from being indifferent to her anger. So </p><p>they had somewhat pooled their fortunes </p><p>and, though rather distrustful of each other, </p><p>had accepted a common alliance against </p><p>the others with whom Willerby took up. </p><p>Besides, there was the tie of blood which </p><p>rather singled them out for the “alliance” </p><p>rather than gave strength to it. </p><p> If Paul should be killed, Lania would</p><p>shed tears, appear inconsolable and really </p><p>miss him. But she would be relieved. </p><p>She rather wished at times that something </p><p>would happen to him. But she never </p><p>showed it, and not altogether futilely she </p><p>kept up a pretense of affection: not so much </p><p>because she was a hypocrite as because she </p><p>knew very well that “something” would </p><p>happen to her if Paul ever became aware of </p><p>hei real feeling toward him. </p><p>Pfcnlll WHEN DuBeque came on deck, the </p><p>p ^four-piece orchestra was strumming </p><p>P^H.iwav below, and the harmony came </p><p>to deck through the- open skylight. Some </p><p>few, one or two couples, were dancing; the </p><p>others sat around laughing and drinking </p><p>from the trays of the white-clad, noiseless- </p><p>footed Chinamen.</p><p> It was far from being the gay, social,</p><p>light-hearted group that it appeared to be— </p><p>that those in it tried to deceive themselves </p><p>into believing that it was. Normal people </p><p>on shipboard quickly grow tired of one </p><p>another. And these people were not nor- </p><p>mal. They had no common denominator </p><p>of interest except what they could get out </p><p>of Willerby. Each was jealous of the other; </p><p>they gossiped furiously, sometimes quar- </p><p>reled and were nightly drunk. Yet the </p><p>women wore gaudy dresses and imitation </p><p>stones; the men had clean pressed duck </p><p>from day to day. </p><p> “Oh, Paul, don’t get hurted,” cooed a</p><p>sharp-tongued little blonde. </p><p> “What’re you going to do? Take the</p><p>brass cannon?” </p><p> “Yes, where’s your artillery, Paul?”</p><p> “If that kid had hit him on the other side of</p><p>the face, he’d look like a nigger with the </p><p>mumps,” said the little blonde. </p><p> But, as Willerby came up with Lania on</p><p>his arm, the voices fell and the jibes were </p><p>less audible. </p><p> “I’m ready, W. W.,” said DuBeque.</p><p> “Why, you've forgot your guns, boy!”</p><p>exclaimed Willerby. </p><p> “I’ve a Derringer in my pocket. I’d</p><p>cam' two holsters if I was going over there </p><p>to bluff.” he said with all the aplomb of a </p><p>hero. “But I'm going to bring him back </p><p>with me.” </p><p> And Paul let his eyes stray around the</p><p>group.' </p><p> “That’s the talk, old boy!” said the</p><p>blonde. </p><p> “He’ll do it, too!” loudly remarked a fat</p><p>roue who suffered from a perpetual short- </p><p>ness of breath. </p><p> But he had a seemingly endless supply of</p><p>“good” stories: that is, the sort of stories </p><p>that were appreciated on the Bebe. </p><p> “Paul,” said Willerby, again laying his</p><p>hand on the young man’s shoulder with a </p><p>kind of rough affection, “I oughtn’t to let </p><p>you go. It’s too risky. Don't take any </p><p>chances with that-” </p><p> And what Williams was in Willerby’s</p><p>opinion had best be left to inference. </p><p> “I’m doing this for you, W. W. You’ve</p><p>been good to me and Lania—” something </p><p>that resembled a very determined effort at </p><p>tenderness came into his voice at the men- </p><p>tion of Lania— “and anything we might do </p><p>is only pacing the interest on our debt, so* </p><p>to speak.” </p><p>Savages</p><p>127 </p><p> And the blonde whispered to the fat</p><p>raconteur: </p><p> “Can you b’lieve it! And the old boy</p><p>swal lows that gush. </p><p> And the fat man, with a. wheeze and a</p><p>puff, whispered back: </p><p> “It’s Lania the old boy’s swallowed.</p><p>Paul’s just hangin’ on to her petticoat.” </p><p>“That snake!” hissed the little blonde, </p><p>who hated tail dark women as a matter of </p><p>esthetic principle. </p><p> “Boy,” said Willerby, “I haven’t done a</p><p>thing for you more ’an you richly deserved. </p><p>From now on I’Ll show you what the </p><p>friendship of Winston Willerby is worth. </p><p>By-I’ll see that you make money-” </p><p> “Not money, W. W. Just your friend-</p><p>ship. That’s all I want!” </p><p> It was raw; not another person on board</p><p>would have had the consummate nerve to </p><p>say such things in the presence of others, </p><p>though any one who could quietly get to </p><p>Willerby’s ear went as far or further. </p><p>Many of the so-called big men of the earth </p><p>want their flattery raw and strong, as </p><p>others want their liquor. They have no </p><p>appreciation of flavors and delicacy. </p><p> DuBeque had long perceived what the</p><p>others had not noticed or, if so, had not </p><p>had nerve enough to act on: Willerby </p><p>liked to be praised in public; he enjoyed </p><p>having spectators. Others shrank from the </p><p>ridicule of their companions. Paul endured </p><p>the ridicule and won the guerdon. But </p><p>then he had more cunning than most people. </p><p>Any of the others would have been confused,, </p><p>routed, if they had ventured the bluff of </p><p>going after Hurricane Williams and had </p><p>unexpectedly been sent. </p><p> “All ready there, Grogan?” Jackson</p><p>shouted down from the side. </p><p> A thick Irish voice rolled back up.</p><p> “All ready, DuBeque/’</p><p> “Good luck an’ look out!” said Willerby.</p><p>Voices shouted their best wishes, tinged </p><p>with compliments, as Paul went down to </p><p>the sea-ladder and got into the boat. </p><p> “Oh, I don’t know what would become of</p><p>me!" said Lania in soft-voiced agony to </p><p>Willerby’s ears alone. </p><p> “I’ll take care of you—always! Paul’s a</p><p>fine boy. May no harm come to him. </p><p>But you—God! You look great to- </p><p>night!” </p><p> Then at the secret shrine of her inner</p><p>heart Lania prayed that her cousin would </p><p>meet Hurricane Williams and die.</p><p>VI </p><p>f m. 'I THE BOAT, after some delay in </p><p>I ©) I locating it, landed at the jetty. </p><p>LJ5&amp;J “Give me a lantern,” said Du </p><p>Beque. </p><p> It was a black night, with that forbidding,</p><p>tropic blackness that is most ominous under </p><p>a half-clouded, half-starlit sky when all the </p><p>land and bush is one solid shadow. </p><p> Grogan thought it a strange request for a</p><p>man who was about to slip into a village. </p><p>But he produced a lantern out of the locker. </p><p> “Lightit,” said DuBeque.</p><p> He was very uncomfortable and wished</p><p>himself headed for the brilliantly lighted </p><p>Bebe rather than the labyrinthine blackness </p><p>of the shore. </p><p> “Phwat the devil does yez want wid a</p><p>lanthem whin-” </p><p> “Will you light that lantern and leave me</p><p>and my business alone?” stormed DuBeque. </p><p>“Think I want to break my neck wandering </p><p>around in that bush?” </p><p> Grogan sullenly lighted the lantern and</p><p>had some difficulty in concealing the wish </p><p>that some such thing would happen to </p><p>DuBeque. </p><p> “Wait here till I come back,” said Du</p><p>Beque as he started off, his mouth in his </p><p>throat, every nerve taut and his fingers </p><p>tightly gripping the derringer that he had </p><p>withdrawn from his pocket. </p><p> He wished that he had not only brought</p><p>two holsters but every man who could </p><p>earn* a gun. He. began to be exceedingly </p><p>fearful that he had undertaken more than </p><p>was wise and seriously debated blowing out </p><p>the lantern and sitting himself down for an </p><p>hour, then reappearing with some stirring </p><p>story of what he had tried to do. But he </p><p>was stung by the knowledge that almost </p><p>everybody on board expected him to do </p><p>some such thing as that. </p><p> His story might not even fool Willerby.</p><p>The old man had surprizing and fiery moods, </p><p>and he was not a pleasant one to whom to re- </p><p>port failures, no matter how they were gar- </p><p>nished with details of the efforts made. </p><p> Now it is not for one minute to be sup-</p><p>posed that DuBeque would have ventured </p><p>into Gopassa if he had really believed any </p><p>of the more barbarous tilings that he and </p><p>others pretended to believe about Williams. </p><p>When the Bebe came in, those on board had </p><p>been surprized and a little suspicious of </p><p>trouble because the natives kept out of </p><p>128 </p><p>Adventure</p><p>sight, but DuBeque very craftily realized, </p><p>after he had blundered into his request to </p><p>go for Williams, that, if Gilbert Lang had </p><p>lived among these natives for weeks and felt </p><p>no fear, it was comparatively safe for him, </p><p>DuBeque, to go into the village. </p><p> It was pretty well known, too, that Wil-</p><p>liams tried to avoid trouble, but crowd him, </p><p>threaten him, and it was something like </p><p>tying a flaming torch to the tail and a red </p><p>rag to the horn of a wild bull. That was </p><p>the reason why DuBeque had summoned up </p><p>courage enough to appear to be unarmed. </p><p>DuBeque knew that he was really running </p><p>but little risk, but he had a difficult time to </p><p>feel that way about it. He had lived in the </p><p>South Seas long enough to be familiar with </p><p>the fact that the coast natives, as a rule, are </p><p>not wanton murderers. </p><p> True, some head-hunter is always likely</p><p>to be the prowling exception, and the of- </p><p>fenses of one white man are apt to be vicari- </p><p>ously expiated by feasting from the next </p><p>who comes. But, if Gilbert Lang had had </p><p>the run of the village, he, DuBeque, would </p><p>be reasonably safe. DuBeque had been </p><p>cunning enough to see that, though he had </p><p>some trouble in summoning up courage </p><p>enough to act on it. And, while there were </p><p>none to deny that Hurricane Williams was a </p><p>dangerous man, there were some to defend </p><p>his character: particularly the old-timers </p><p>who had married native wives and settled </p><p>down to patriarchal dignity and who re- </p><p>sented the encroachment of civilization. </p><p> DuBeque was confident that, if he could</p><p>come face to face with Williams, he would </p><p>come to the end of his scheme all right. He </p><p>was cold with fear, jumpy and nervous by </p><p>being forced to walk alone in the ever- </p><p>mysterious night, fringed—one might sa\— </p><p>by the jungle growth. Yet he had to come </p><p>alone. He would not, for almost anything, </p><p>have let those on the Bebe know what words </p><p>he intended to use to Williams. There </p><p>were depths within depths to the cunning of </p><p>Paul DuBeque. </p><p> DuBeque had left the jetty and was walk-</p><p>ing up the beach toward a hut, the shaggy </p><p>roof of which was faintly perceptible in the </p><p>dimmest of starlight. </p><p> A voice close at hand called out in painful</p><p>English— </p><p> “Who you?”</p><p> The jerk of the lantern showed how high</p><p>DuBeque jumped, and in his fear he came </p><p>near shooting blindly. </p><p> With some effort DuBeque stammered in</p><p>the trade vernacular: </p><p> “Me fellow come gammon him fellow</p><p>Williams. You fellow go me quick.” </p><p> There was no direct answer for some time,</p><p>but he could hear voices clacking and mur- </p><p>muring where his remark was evidently </p><p>being debated. The delay and suspense </p><p>came near to stiffening DuBeque’s hair. </p><p>The impulse to drop the lantern and run </p><p>was strong, and the cold sweat stood on him </p><p>as on the body of one dead from fright, </p><p>but he succeeded not only in standing his </p><p>ground but in calling out: </p><p> “You fellows like-quick* No plenty</p><p>time.” </p><p> The voices grew a lit tie more loud. Then</p><p>the crunch of sand, and out of the darkness of </p><p>pandanus bushes shapes moved toward him </p><p> DuBeque lifted his lantern to get a look.</p><p>Three stalwart native^, not Solomon Island- </p><p>ers, approached, and each carried a rifle. </p><p>That was a little unusual, more so than one </p><p>might think when rifles are the chief desire of </p><p>a native toward a trader. But the tropic </p><p>rust, particularly in the wet Solomons, soon </p><p>reduces the uncared for rifle to such a state </p><p>of junk that even the native throws it away. </p><p>Of course, it is alwa)^ evil spirits that ruin </p><p>the precious rifle. </p><p> “Me go with you,” said one who spoke</p><p>English after a fashion. </p><p> “Who are you?” DuBeque asked as he</p><p>scrutinized the handsome face—handsome, </p><p>that is, for a native. </p><p> “Banoo.”</p><p> Then Banoo strode off, leading the way.</p><p> Williams sat in his hut with the door</p><p>drawn. It was drawn not for protection or </p><p>fear of peering eyes but somewhat to shut </p><p>out the insects that would swarm and fall </p><p>finger-deep about the light, flap themselves </p><p>on the pages of t he book he was reading and </p><p>crawl over his body with irritating slowness. </p><p>The book he read was a book of his own </p><p>writing, a sort of amplified log, not of ad- </p><p>ventures and what he saw, but a thing full </p><p>of nautical findings, of winds and depths and </p><p>tides and sightings. </p><p> Banoo scratched on the door and spoke;</p><p>then Williams slipped it back. </p><p> Banoo told him that this lone man had</p><p>come off the Bebe to talk. </p><p> “What do you want?’’ Williams asked be-</p><p>fore Banoo had finished. </p><p> The question came out like the uneven</p><p>volley of a squad. </p><p>Savages </p><p>129</p><p>DUBEQUE stepped closer, came </p><p>into the square of light that the </p><p>lantern, hung from the hut rafter, </p><p>shot through the doorway. The lantern </p><p>that he carried had made only a pool of </p><p>light about his feet. </p><p> Then DuBeque lied as with all of his</p><p>practise he had never lied before. He did </p><p>not choose his words with care but spoke </p><p>with that fluent earnestness that is so </p><p>amazing to truth-tellers, who are not only </p><p>surprized that some people will deliberately </p><p>misstate facts but elaborately relate false </p><p>details. </p><p> DuBeque began by saying “that boy Gil-</p><p>bert” had got himself into trouble. He had </p><p>heard that Willerby was no friend of yours, </p><p>Williams, and said that he was not one </p><p>either. </p><p> “I’m one of Willerby’s managers, Wil-</p><p>liams, and he has often been angry at you. </p><p>He thinks you’ve interfered with his traders </p><p>and recruiters before now, but down deep </p><p>the old man’s had to admire you. I’ve </p><p>often heard him say so. He is a good deal of </p><p>a fighter himself. Especially in his younger </p><p>days, and, whenever he has thought you </p><p>have hurt his pocketbook—why, of course, </p><p>he has been furious. But, when that fellow </p><p>Gilbert came on board and said he heard </p><p>that Hurricane Williams was an outlaw and </p><p>pirate and that Willerby wanted him and </p><p>that he, Gilbert, would be glad to point out </p><p>your hut so a party could sneak up and grab </p><p>you—why, Williams, W. W. very nearly </p><p>tramped the deck in. He was that mad. </p><p> “He just tore around, and I got this—”</p><p>indicating his blackened face—“by stepping </p><p>in between them when he was swinging on </p><p>that fellow Gilbert. W. W.’s a big man, and </p><p>that fellow’s nothing but a boy, and I knew </p><p>W. W. ’d be sorry—he always is—if he hurt </p><p>the boy. But the idea of anybody suggest- </p><p>ing such a thing to him made him clear </p><p>crazy. He sent me over here to tell you </p><p>about it. Gilbert’s praying the old man </p><p>won’t put him ashore, and the old man </p><p>won’t have him on the ship.” </p><p> Williams listened closely. His body was</p><p>stiff and rigid, his eyes agleam. Out of the </p><p>bitterness of experience with his fellow men </p><p>he saw no reason for doubting that Gilbert </p><p>Lang had done precisely as DuBeque said. </p><p>The boy had never concealed dislike for him, </p><p>and that afternoon he had undoubtedly </p><p>been frightened by having Williams sur- </p><p>prize him with Uala. Treachery was what </p><p>Williams expected from all men, all white</p><p>ones. He had thought Gilbert Lang dif- </p><p>ferent. </p><p> The boy was different from most men, but</p><p>in them all was the streak of treachery. So, </p><p>though he might believe what was reported </p><p>ill of Gilbert Lang, he saw no reason for ac- </p><p>cepting what was reported gallant of Wins- </p><p>ton Willerby. He had never met WTillerby, </p><p>but he had met men who told of Willerby’s </p><p>anything but gallant threats toward him. </p><p> “Is that all you have to say?” Williams</p><p>asked through a strained throat, though his </p><p>voice was not loud. </p><p> “Why, yes,” DuBeque replied, surprized,</p><p>disconcerted, “about all-” </p><p> “Then go to-!”</p><p> Those words came slowly, deliberately, as</p><p>if .definitely ridding himself of DuBeque, </p><p>Willerby and Gilbert Lang. </p><p> Williams turned abruptly to the table</p><p>and sat down, his back toward the door out- </p><p>side of which stood DuBeque and Banoo. </p><p> “But, Williams,” DuBeque protested,</p><p>scarcely knowing what he would say next </p><p>but determined to say something, anything, </p><p>that might possibly get through the baffling </p><p>reserve of this man. </p><p> “ B u t,'Wil liams, ” he repea t ed,speaking very</p><p>earnestly, for he was in earnest,“I knew how </p><p>you feel about that boy, and I don’t blame </p><p>you. I know the chance of you and Wil- </p><p>lerby ever really being friends is too remote </p><p>to suggest. I know you don’t care what </p><p>Willerby or anybody else that trades or re- </p><p>cruits thinks of you—” the words were com- </p><p>ing easier now; DuBeque could see a clear </p><p>course of argument—“but here is a chance </p><p>for you to meet Willerby, and you can tell </p><p>him just what his traders and blackbirders do </p><p>do. He doesn’t believe the reports, Williams. </p><p> “We’ve all hinted at the way they rob</p><p>and kidnap, but it makes him furious, be- </p><p>cause he simply doesn’t believe it. And, to </p><p>be honest with you, all of us are afraid to tell </p><p>him the cold truth. You are not. And, as I </p><p>told you before, the old man admires you. </p><p>You should hear the w^ay he makes fun to </p><p>their faces of the officers that go poking </p><p>about in gunboats trying to locate you. Of </p><p>course, that's only if none of his traders or </p><p>captains have recently had a run-in with </p><p>you. W. W.’s a queer old fellow, Williams, </p><p>but he has a big heart. He wants to meet </p><p>you. He sent me over here to ask you to </p><p>come aboard this evening. You can see, I </p><p>came alone.” </p><p>130 </p><p>Adventure</p><p> The last sentence was the most eloquent</p><p>(hat DuBeque had said. It left to plain in- </p><p>ference much that no amount of words could </p><p>have made so effective. </p><p> Now Hurricane Williams was, for reasons</p><p>of his own, an exile. He had taken up with </p><p>and lived entirely among those who are called </p><p>savages because their society, cast of mind </p><p>and values—hut more especially their na- </p><p>kedness—differ from those of the earth’s </p><p>dominant nations. He hated white men </p><p>with an intensity that could not have en- </p><p>dured without being perpetually nourished </p><p>by memories. Yet tlie roots of his being ran </p><p>too deeply into the white race, which had </p><p>borne him and his fathers, to be torn out </p><p>even by all the strength and fierceness with </p><p>which he had tom at them. </p><p> His conscience was clear. It was sheer</p><p>bitterness that made him hate liis race, yet </p><p>he knew, though he might try not to ac- </p><p>knowledge it within his own thoughts, that </p><p>there were men other than the treacherous, </p><p>dishonest, brutal, sneaking fellows it seemed </p><p>bis fortune to have always encountered. </p><p>Gilbert Lang had seemed such a one. It </p><p>was a surprize, but scarcely a disappoint- </p><p>ment, to hear that he was not. However, it </p><p>was a surprize to hear what he had of Wil- </p><p>lerby. </p><p> He did not feel enraged toward Gilbert</p><p>Lang. When a man has been disappointed </p><p>oft in much the same way, he ceases to feel a </p><p>sense of injury against any one in particu- </p><p>lar but holds a grudge against the general </p><p>class, as the misogynist, misanthrope, </p><p>Anglophobe—or, as in Williams’case, against </p><p>white men. </p><p> He wheeled on DuBeque with the words:</p><p> “I’ll go—as you came. Alone.”</p><p> Again the inextinguishable hope, like a</p><p>fire that could not be tramped out or dead </p><p>ened by water, lifted a tiny flame. Perhaps </p><p>Willerby was such a man as DuBeque had </p><p>said. </p><p> DuBeque did not know it, but he had his</p><p>battered features, swollen lips and eyes </p><p>largely to thank for his success. One glance </p><p>at his normal face and Williams would have </p><p>distrusted him. As it *as, Williams did not </p><p>really believe him. He simply did not en- </p><p>tirely doubt him. </p><p> Williams went as he was; that is, naked</p><p>except for trousers cut off above the knees </p><p>and unarmed except for a sheath-knife with </p><p>lanyard to it which he could slip over his </p><p>wrist. He wore the knife because it was </p><p>handy in the brush or water; if occasion re-</p><p>quired, it might serve to rip a shark. Wil- </p><p>liams was as much at his ease in Lhe water </p><p>as any native, and those of die coast are </p><p>practically amphibious. </p><p> He walked swiftly along the street, and</p><p>DuBeque was hard put to keep up with </p><p>him, and, though he spoke from time to </p><p>time, Williams did not answer. </p><p> Not only Banoo but a group of armed</p><p>natives joined him on the way and followed </p><p>to the end of the jetty. </p><p> Before he got into the boat, Williams said</p><p>something to Banoo that the white men did </p><p>not understand, but one of the blade boys </p><p>at the oars heard and shivered. He chanced </p><p>to be a Samoan. </p><p> Williams dropped lightly into the boat</p><p>and sat down. DuBeque followed with the </p><p>order to shove off. </p><p> “Mr. Grogan,” said DuBeque, too pleased</p><p>with himself to keep quiet, “this is Mr. </p><p>Williams!” </p><p>GROGAN was embarrassed. He </p><p>had no use for DuBeque. He won- </p><p>dered if Williams could be the man </p><p>rumor made him out, since DuBeque had </p><p>brought him so easily. DuBeque had not </p><p>said that as an introduction—at least W’il- </p><p>liams took no notice of it—but rather a </p><p>veiled wav of gloating. However, Grogan, </p><p>being of that rough class among whom an </p><p>introduction invariably implies a hand- </p><p>shake, put out his hand and took it back. </p><p>Williams stared at him but said nothing, </p><p>made no move. </p><p> “Mr. Grogan is one of our officers,”</p><p>DuBeque hurried on explanatorially and ap- </p><p>parently a little afraid that he had made </p><p>what the French call a faux pas. </p><p> DuBeque did not intend to conceal from</p><p>anybody that he had cajoled Williams into </p><p>the trap. He was proud of that. But he </p><p>was quite sure that even Willerby would not </p><p>approve of the mamier in which it had been </p><p>done if he knew of it That was really the </p><p>chief reason DuBeque had dared to go </p><p>alone. Willerby would be furious to know </p><p>that, even to serve his ends, it had been said </p><p>that he ever admired Williams or would </p><p>treat him otherwise than contemptuously. </p><p>DuBeque was something of an adept at </p><p>judging men. He had unerringly, one </p><p>might almost say instinctively, made about </p><p>the only possible appeal to Williams that </p><p>could have been effective. </p><p>Savages </p><p>131 </p><p> Williams said nothing. Perhaps he sensed</p><p>the trap. It would not have been the </p><p>first time that he walked into danger, fully </p><p>suspecting all that was to come and </p><p>apparently both unsuspicious and unpro- </p><p>tected. </p><p> The nightly gaiety on the Bebe floated in</p><p>drunken laughter and sportive cries to the </p><p>boat that was slowly approaching, and shad- </p><p>ows glided and drifted under the brilliantly </p><p>lighted awning. </p><p> “Grogan?” called a heavy voice in a kind</p><p>of subdued tone as the boat drew near. </p><p> “Yez, soir.”</p><p> “Is DuBeque with you?”</p><p> “I’m here,” DuBeque called loudly, “and</p><p>so is Williams!” </p><p> Jackson said something loud but indis-</p><p>tinct—something like an oath of surprize </p><p>that struggled out in spite of himself. </p><p> Williams scrambled up the ladder swiftly</p><p>as a monkey runs up a vine. Less rapidly, </p><p>but helped by eagerness, DuBeque came </p><p>after. </p><p> As Grogan put his hand to the ladder, the</p><p>Samoan sailor spoke to him, and the mate </p><p>stopped to listen in amazement. </p><p> "Williams?” said the loud-voiced Jackson.</p><p> Williams stopped, and his eyes flashed on</p><p>Jackson’s bearded face. </p><p> “You don’t remember me?”</p><p> “No,” said Williams gruffly, abruptly.</p><p> “Just as well,” Jackson replied. “I</p><p>never hold a grudge ’gainst a better man </p><p>than me.” Then, lowering his face, he </p><p>added swifdy: “I don’t know why you </p><p>come. But look out!” </p><p> And Jackson turned with a cheerful</p><p>greeting to give DuBeque a hand over the </p><p>freeboard. </p><p> “Aye, Skipper, wan woird wid yez,”</p><p>Grogan called up. </p><p> “What is it, Grogan?” Jackson answered</p><p>down. </p><p> “Oi’ll bay r-right up,” and Grogan came</p><p>fast, and Jackson waited. But DuBeque and </p><p>Williams had gone aft at once. </p><p> On the poop there was that noise which</p><p>passes for gaiety. The seven or eight peo- </p><p>ple who made up Willerby’s guests were </p><p>drinking and dancing. Existence on the </p><p>Bebe would have been intolerable without </p><p>the elixir of heady wine, not so much be- </p><p>cause they loved the wine—though they did </p><p>that, too—as because of the insufferable </p><p>ennui which only the inspiriting grape </p><p>would cause to vanish. </p><p> DuBeque flung himself up the poop lad-</p><p>der, followed by Williams.</p><p> “Oh, W. W.,” DuBeque called shrilly,</p><p>elated, “here’s Williams!” </p><p> For a moment those words seemed to</p><p>smother the Lips of all who heard: the </p><p>quick silence of surprize, and no movement </p><p>but the turning of heads and craning of </p><p>necks. Then all edged nearer, gaping vul- </p><p>ture-eyed to look upon the man who had </p><p>almost become a legend in the South </p><p>Seas. </p><p> He seemed to fill the part that rumor gave</p><p>him: naked, fierce-eyed, short-bearded, with </p><p>hair unevenly, carelessly cut short. And he </p><p>stood firm-footed, legs apart, like a statue of </p><p>bronze. Every muscle was tense, and the </p><p>body, though not huge, or even big, was </p><p>gnarled with the knotted muscles which </p><p>were supple and smooth enough in his </p><p>quieter moods. </p><p> He was hedged about. The women, low-</p><p>waisted, in flimsy gowns of rainbowed silk, </p><p>gaped tipsily, and the men in those gro- </p><p>tesque attitudes of surprize and drunken- </p><p>ness stared through frog-lidded eyes and </p><p>with mouths dropped. </p><p> Then Willerby, drunk but scarcely show-</p><p>ing itr, for like a barrel—the more solid </p><p>when filled—he seemed physically im- </p><p>pervious to wine in any quantity, roughly </p><p>shoved his way through. And on his arm </p><p>came Lania, forgetting the pose of tipsiness </p><p>which was nightly assumed to account for </p><p>the glasses she managed to pour overboard. </p><p>Inside the circle she slipped from his arm </p><p>and stepped back, crowding against those </p><p>behind her, sensing danger, seeing it, since </p><p>her eyes were clear, in that bronzed body </p><p>that stood as if cast from molten metal to </p><p>convey Lhe great artist’s idea of a dangerous </p><p>man at bay. </p><p> Such refinement of perception was denied</p><p>the fume-blurred eyes about her, for Du </p><p>Beque was as drunk with pride as any </p><p>other man with wine, and Jackson, who had </p><p>quietly come up the ladder, was some dis- </p><p>tance away and at Williams’ back. </p><p> Willerby swelled out, planted both hands</p><p>on his hips and glared. The great mo- </p><p>ment w’as at hand. His sycophants were </p><p>about him, waiting to listen. </p><p> But, before Willerby spoke, Williams did.</p><p>He had been long ago, or long as time is </p><p>valued in such a crisis, disillusioned. His </p><p>voice was hard and cold. </p><p> “Where’s that boy?”</p><p>132 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Something resembling a shock was felt by</p><p>those who stood around. Here was not a </p><p>prisoner but a challenger! </p><p> Willerby raised his voice and said slowly,</p><p>as insolently as he could— </p><p> “He is where you will be - quick—</p><p>in irons!” Then he continued, his voice </p><p>quavering rhetorically, like a poor actor in a </p><p>big scene, for, though he was not acting, he </p><p>was sj&gt;eaking to the ears of the gallery gods </p><p>on his poop as much as to Williams. He </p><p>cursed the man, spoke of the yardarm and </p><p>hemp, mentioned “white cannibals.’’ </p><p> Only once did Williams take his gleaming</p><p>eyes from Willerby's face. He shifted them </p><p>for a barely preccptible instant as if to </p><p>mark the place where DuBeque stood. </p><p> Willerby at length paused for breath, and</p><p>Williams spoke again. It was as if he </p><p>had not heard anything that had been said </p><p>except the first sentence. </p><p> ‘‘In chains—why?”</p><p> Williams' questions were like grappling-</p><p>hooks that jerked out answers by sheer </p><p>force. </p><p> “Because he’s a friend of yours! Why</p><p>else do you suppose? I offered to make his </p><p>fortune,” Willerby went on in a slightly ag- </p><p>grieved voice as a missionary might say he </p><p>had tried to save an unregenerate sinner, </p><p>‘'but—” the wine perhaps was a little con- </p><p>fusing to brain though not to his legs—“he </p><p>told me to go to-! And I’ll send him </p><p>there, and you with him!” </p><p> THEN IT happened as men who</p><p>know of him say it always hap- </p><p>pened with Williams. As the hurri- </p><p>cane strikes with scarcely a warning for </p><p>those who are not watchf ul, Williams struck. </p><p>He half wheeled; an arm flashed out; </p><p>DuBeque was down unconscious for min- </p><p>utes and sickened for days to come. </p><p> Cries, shouts, screams. A roar of “kill</p><p>him” from Willerby throwm to the ship at </p><p>large but more or less directly at the burly </p><p>form of Jackson. Yells from amidships. </p><p>Women and men on the poop, fearful yet </p><p>fascinated, screamed and jostled but did not </p><p>turn away their faces, and some drunken </p><p>hands half clutched at Williams as he </p><p>bounded back from where DuBeque lay. </p><p>Lania glided to one side. Only she and </p><p>Williams were silent. </p><p> Williams glanced quickly to right and</p><p>left; then he rushed straight into the huge fist </p><p>of Willerby, taking a glancing blow on the </p><p>neck and going on right up against him. A </p><p>hand, steel-fingered, closed on Willerby’s </p><p>f ull throat, and a blow like the drive of a pis-</p><p>ton smashed into his face. He dropped. </p><p> A swift backward glance over his shoulder,</p><p>and Williams wheeled to meet Jackson. </p><p>But Jackson stopped. Jackson was no cow- </p><p>ard, but lor one thing his heart was not in </p><p>in the fight. He had plenty of sins on his </p><p>head, but the gospel of fair-play was at least </p><p>faintly ingrained within him. * Besides, he </p><p>had once been at grips with Williams; be- </p><p>sides, still further, sailors were swarming </p><p>from forecastle and amidships, and Grogan </p><p>was coming up the poop ladder. Perhaps a </p><p>little influence from all those things caused </p><p>Jackson to stop. He began to talk about </p><p>it and raised his hand in a kind of repress- </p><p>ing, soothing gesture. </p><p> “We’ve got you. Williams. There’s no</p><p>use making more trouble. Here come-” </p><p> A half smile seemed to appear on Wil-</p><p>liams lips. It may have been that he </p><p>merely parted them in a strained way to </p><p>suck his lungs full of air. Anyway, his eyes </p><p>darted toward the top of poop ladder. Men </p><p>were coming. Sheer numbers would pile </p><p>him down. </p><p> He turned and lunged aft. Those in his</p><p>way were too surprized and slow to get clear </p><p>of his road, and a man and a woman were </p><p>bowled over as ten-pins fly from the side of </p><p>the ball. The little blonde crazily clutched </p><p>out at him. With drunken luck her fingers </p><p>slipped into the waistband of his trousers </p><p>and tightened. Williams scarcely looked </p><p>around: a back-handed blow and he was </p><p>free and her beauty was spoiled for a month. </p><p> Then he leaped. Between taffrail and</p><p>awning he dived and into the water. </p><p> A rush to the rail, shouting and pointing</p><p>to where the phosphorescent water like a </p><p>trail of fire-sparks marked his course. </p><p> “The boat—after him—kill him!” Wil-</p><p>lerby shouted hoarsely. </p><p> His throat was painfully wrenched. The</p><p>windpipe seemed to have been almost </p><p>jerked out. and. as he came unsteadily to his </p><p>feet, he felt as if the ship were swinging </p><p>and swaying in an oily sea. </p><p> “Tell that lugger to lower away, too,”</p><p>Willerby shouted again. </p><p> Voices screamed across the water toward</p><p>the lugger that lay nearest. But Jackson </p><p>had gone, and his was the only voice that </p><p>would carry easily now that Willerby’s was </p><p>choked down to hoarseness, and the few </p><p>Savages </p><p>133 </p><p>men on board the lugger were slow to get the </p><p>order into their ears or through their heads.</p><p> The boat alongside was delayed a little in</p><p>getting away. Rifles were fetched. Then </p><p>it was found to be overcrowded, and some </p><p>of the crew were sent up, leaving just </p><p>enough to man the oars, excepting Jackson </p><p>and Grogan. A white sailor steered. </p><p> Williams was a fast swimmer, but he had</p><p>a hundred and fifty yards to go. </p><p> The boat swung out clear of the ship.</p><p>Grogan and Jackson fired. The mark was </p><p>not visible, only the phosphorescent wake of </p><p>the swimmer, and the bullets striking the </p><p>water—unless an almost spent ricochet— </p><p>rarely leave even a passing flashing of water- </p><p>sparks. </p><p> But, after they fired, the phosphorescent</p><p>trail vanished; the water disturbed in swim- </p><p>ming smoothed out. </p><p> “-, did we get him!” Jackson ex-</p><p>claimed anxiously. </p><p> “Oi shot hoigh,” said Grogan, and both</p><p>looked back a little apprehensively toward </p><p>the Bebe, where cheering and compliments </p><p>came from over the rail. </p><p> Then the cheering died, and shouts of</p><p>“Look!” “There!” rose. </p><p> Again the water betrayed Williams after a</p><p>long dive. </p><p> Jackson and Grogan shot again, and</p><p>again Wiliams dived. </p><p> The lugger had lowered away.</p><p> “-them!” said Jackson, glancing in the</p><p>direction of the reinforcements as shooting </p><p>began from that boat. </p><p> Williams was swimming fast, and his</p><p>dives were long. But oars bent in the water, </p><p>and the boats gained and gained. There </p><p>was little chance of hitting him until the </p><p>boats were almost on top of him, but they </p><p>would be there before he could reach shore. </p><p> Then from the water and through his</p><p>cupped hands as he treaded it, Williams </p><p>shouted one word twice: </p><p> “Banoo! Banoo!”</p><p> The shore suddenly seemed alive with</p><p>savages. Yells and howls, the fire of rifles, </p><p>and presently the streaks of phosphorescent </p><p>wakes as the canoes took to the water. </p><p> All Gopassa was on the beach. What</p><p>Banoo and those with him had heard and </p><p>seen when Williams left with DuBeque had </p><p>rapidly been repeated, and all the Sa- </p><p>moans, Tongans and Gopassans had come to </p><p>the beach, where they had squatted and </p><p>talked wonderingly, awaiting the dawn. </p><p> The pursuers were abruptly turned into</p><p>the pursued, and the boats went about and </p><p>made for the ships as fast as the frightened</p><p>oarsmen could take them. Both boats </p><p>fired and in earnest, but little harm could be </p><p>done in the darkness. </p><p> The water was alive with canoes and as</p><p>if all the fiends of hell were on it. </p><p>Howls and yells of derision, taunts, were </p><p>flung from the distance, the lessening dis- </p><p>tance, as the canoes swept on. </p><p> Then there broke from the Bebe a mighty</p><p>flash and roar. The old brass camion split </p><p>the cup of heaven, and its echoes crashed </p><p>amid cliffs and hills: It had never failed to </p><p>intimidate natives, and there was mo- </p><p>mentarily a quiet and hush when its thun- </p><p>dering echoes died away. </p><p> But shouts rose. The shouts were from</p><p>Banoo, Nauma and Chief Ghorki calling </p><p>their warriors home, for Williams had been </p><p>picked up and had told them to go back to </p><p>the beach. The shouts set the howling and </p><p>yells loose again. The canoes turned beach- </p><p>ward with much the reluctance that children </p><p>show in leaving a street-fight. and cries of </p><p>derision at the “white” boats for fleeing </p><p>gave the natives a sense of victory. </p><p> “We’re lucky,” said Jackson in a throaty</p><p>whisper to Grogan. </p><p> Grogan loosened a big, big sigh of relief</p><p>and some thick profanity, too. </p><p> “The old man wouldn’t believe it; so we</p><p>might as well say nothin’.” </p><p> “R-r-right,” said Grogan as he put out his</p><p>hand to steady himself against the side of the </p><p>Bebe as the boat came alongside the ladder. </p><p> The Samoan sailor who had overheard</p><p>Williams speak to Banoo had told Grogan, </p><p>and Grogan had told Jackson, and they, </p><p>being men who had often crossed Williams’ </p><p>trail, did not doubt that the sailor had been </p><p>right when he claimed that Williams had </p><p>said to the savages on the jetty— </p><p> “If I don’t come back, blow up their ship</p><p>at dawm!” </p><p>VII </p><p>WILLERBY- held a council of war. </p><p>A number of things were decided. </p><p>He decided them. The others ac- </p><p>quiesced, no matter what secret misgivings </p><p>they may have had. </p><p> First, however, everybody wanted to</p><p>know of DuBeque how on earth he had </p><p>managed to get Hurricane Williams on </p><p>board the Bebe. </p><p>134 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> For the moment DuBeque considered</p><p>his broken jaw providential. Then some </p><p>one suggested lhat he write it out. Du-</p><p>Ueque was really very miserable. He did </p><p>not feel like writing. One of the men, not </p><p>entirely sober at the time, who claimed </p><p>to have been a medical student in liis youth, </p><p>took DuBeque in band, wrenched the jaw </p><p>painfully in locating the break, swathed his </p><p>head in bandages and, making a “straw” </p><p>oi oiled paper, let him suck down a drink. </p><p> Thereupon DuBeque wrote that he had</p><p>gone ashore with the intention of putting </p><p>a gun to Williams’ head and ordering him </p><p>to come along, but Williams had asked </p><p>about the boy, Gilbert, and DuBeque had </p><p>scud he had been put in irons. Williams </p><p>was angry about that, but DuBeque had </p><p>said he had better tell his troubles to </p><p>Willerby. Williams said he would go right </p><p>on board and do that very thing, and </p><p>DuBeque had replied that it was just as </p><p>well because he, DuBeque, had come after </p><p>him for the purpose of taking him back, </p><p>without trouble if possible. </p><p> “What? Send but one man after me?”</p><p>Williams had exclaimed. </p><p> “Why not? You are only one man,”</p><p>DuBeque had said. </p><p> “I’ll go,” said Williams.</p><p> Thus it all happened according to</p><p>DuBeque. </p><p> That wras an adroit and plausible ex-</p><p>planation and seemed, in its essential </p><p>features, true, but some of those who read </p><p>it wondered what would have happened </p><p>had DuBeque not been lucky enough to </p><p>find Williams in a humor for coming, and a </p><p>few were inclined to think that DuBeque </p><p>had been braver than they suspected in </p><p>taking the chance. </p><p> Then Willerby proceeded with his council</p><p>of war.. </p><p> Hurricane Williams was to be wiped off</p><p>the face of the earth. </p><p> Somewhere near in one of the many</p><p>bays and islets he had his ship. That </p><p>must be captured, li would in a way </p><p>serve as an indemnity for the trouble of </p><p>wiping him off the earth. </p><p> The Gopassans must be stirred up to</p><p>make trouble for him and his natives. </p><p> What shell and pearls he had obtained</p><p>must l^e apprehended, as they were more </p><p>or less anyhow the personal property of </p><p>Willerby—or, at least, such was his feeling </p><p>about them. </p><p> But all of those w^ere incidental to the</p><p>sale and sure move contemplated. A Ger- </p><p>man gunboat, the Print, was some two </p><p>hundred miles away at Shortland Island.</p><p>Willerby knew the officers well, and they </p><p>liked hjm—or, rather, had liked his wine and </p><p>friends. With that far-sightedness that </p><p>always characterizes the successful man </p><p>of business, Willerby had foreseen that </p><p>German influence would be strong enough </p><p>to get a portion of the South Seas, and he </p><p>wished to keep on the agreeable side of </p><p>the Germans. In other words, he foresaw </p><p>the coming agreement that would put some </p><p>of the smaller islands and Bougainville </p><p>under the Kaiser's protectorate. </p><p> The Prinz was now at Shortland making</p><p>surveys of the little island, Morgusaia, </p><p>with that methodical exactitude which </p><p>Germans use in picking up the crums </p><p>dropped by empire-grabbing nations. That </p><p>exhaustive survey and charting would add </p><p>w’eight to German claims in the South Seas. </p><p>The capture of Williams would also be </p><p>very agreeable to the Prinz, and the Ger- </p><p>mans would remember the favor Willerby </p><p>had done them. </p><p> So it was decided that the next morning</p><p>the larger lugger should take on fresh </p><p>water, get aboard a few of the best sailors </p><p>from the Bebt and slip dowm the coast to </p><p>the Prinz. </p><p> The next morning it was raining—as usual.</p><p> Willerby and his friends lay late abed—</p><p>as usual. </p><p> Grogan went on board the lugger as</p><p>skipper and found her in need of refilling </p><p>water-casks. One way to fill them was to </p><p>go to the stream that flowed dowm to the </p><p>bay from around the east side of the </p><p>village. Another was to spread canvas </p><p>and catch the rain. </p><p> Willerby awoke in an irritable mood.</p><p>For one thing, his throat was more painful </p><p>than ever. Instead of a glass of raw </p><p>brandy poured down by way of letting </p><p>his stomach know he was up, he was </p><p>compelled to sip a hot toddy. He went </p><p>on deck and found the rain. He w'as tired </p><p>of rain. It seemed to him that not even </p><p>Noah had endured so much rain. He was </p><p>in the mood for ripping somebody up for </p><p>something. But the poop had already </p><p>been washed down and the brass work </p><p>shined. There were no raffle about and </p><p>everything looked shipshape. </p><p> Only a man who has looked for trouble</p><p>Savages </p><p>135 </p><p>knows how irritating'it is to find things in </p><p>order. He looked out at the lugger. Why </p><p>hadn’t she got under weigh hours ago?</p><p>And what on earth were they doing? </p><p>Catching rain-water when a fresh water </p><p>stream was in plain sight. He would show </p><p>them, he would! He sent for his speaking- </p><p>trumpet, but at the first shout through it </p><p>he was reminded of Williams’ fingers. That </p><p>did nothing to relieve his temper. </p><p> He ordered the boat manned, and over</p><p>to the lugger he went. His voice was </p><p>rather hoarse, and it was not easy to speak, </p><p>but he spoke. </p><p> Afraid of the natives, was Grogan? Well,</p><p>in the name of all that was profane and </p><p>much that was obscene, no niggers should </p><p>ever have the satisfaction of knowing that </p><p>Winston Willerby was afraid of them. </p><p>Empty those casks that had already been </p><p>filled, and overboard with the string of them. </p><p>He would send a guard along. He would </p><p>do better than that; he would send presents, </p><p>too. Here was a chance to make friends </p><p>with the natives. </p><p> To hear him tell of it, one would have</p><p>thought that Grogan had been deliberately </p><p>trying to cheat Winston Willerby of the </p><p>opportunity of making friends with the </p><p>natives, and, having more or less stumbled </p><p>on to the idea, he began to make the filling </p><p>of the kegs a great occasion. </p><p> So Willerby went back to the Bebe.</p><p>Trade goods were broken out, bottles of </p><p>cheap whisky brought up, rifles taken from </p><p>their oiled rags. </p><p> A bottle of whisky in one hand and a rifle</p><p>in the other: thus does the civilized white </p><p>man ever meet the savage. </p><p> The native village was sleepy. It had</p><p>been up the night before. Besides, it was </p><p>raining. </p><p> AND at dawn, long before it was</p><p>BPgd time to get up, particularly after a </p><p>late vigil, Baraka came into the </p><p>street, prancing and yowling. True, he </p><p>had first gone to the hut of Williams to </p><p>consult concerning affairs of magic, but </p><p>Williams was gone. But the sun-maker </p><p>had been effective the day before; so why </p><p>not again? Barak$ knew that his fees and </p><p>promises of pay for sun would not be forth- </p><p>coming if he did not make it stay out a </p><p>reasonable length of time. True "enough, </p><p>he could easily have found a way to put the </p><p>blame on the villagers themselves. </p><p> There were a thousand little infractions</p><p>of tabu that could always be invoked as </p><p>having spoiled the delicate charms of the </p><p>devil-devil man. But Baraka, no matter </p><p>what lack of faith he may have had in his</p><p>own wizardry, put implicit confidence in </p><p>the strange box that Williams had given </p><p>him. So he went early into the street, </p><p>swung his child’s toy and made magic. </p><p> But it rained harder and harder.</p><p> Baraka was an old man, and he did not</p><p>like the exertion. Moreover, he did not </p><p>like the rain. It came in torrents. </p><p> He had committed himself so far that he</p><p>could not stop without rendering his village </p><p>a little skeptical. True, he could think up </p><p>explanations, but explanations had to be </p><p>convincing. And there were some of the </p><p>Tongans, for instance, who did not believe </p><p>in his magic. They made slighting re- </p><p>marks. Their influence was bad. </p><p> By eleven o’clock Baraka was pretty</p><p>much disgusted. The rain swept down in </p><p>sheets. It was a cold, chilling rain, too. </p><p> Then he saw the boats coming for shore</p><p>and towing the water-casks. He was sur- </p><p>prized. Other natives were surprized. </p><p>Here was something to be watched and </p><p>talked over. There was a flurry of excite- </p><p>ment in the village. Were they coming </p><p>to attack? Should they be attacked? </p><p> Neither Williams nor Banoo could be</p><p>found. Nauma had been given no in- </p><p>structions concerning such an emergency, </p><p>and by nature he was—as most Samoans </p><p>are—peaceable without being cowardly. </p><p>The Tongans are somewhat the same, too, </p><p>but the Tongans are much more ready to </p><p>fight than any other peaceable folk. Per- </p><p>haps one of the reasons is that they do it </p><p>exceedingly well. But the Gopassans were </p><p>very much in doubt as to what to do, and </p><p>moreover, Baraka, who held “peace” or </p><p>“war” in any one of the gourds he cared to </p><p>peep into, remembered the amazing wealth </p><p>that had been showered on him the after- </p><p>noon before by the generous Jackson. </p><p> In some respects the native is much like</p><p>everybody else. His appetite for wealth, </p><p>if he is at all avaricious, as devil-devil men </p><p>always are, grows by what it is fed on. In </p><p>some other respects the native is exceed- </p><p>ingly peculiar. He buys children to raise </p><p>as his own from the bushmen with whom </p><p>he has an inveterate feud, yet bushmen and </p><p>women come into the coastal marts and </p><p>purchase salt and—if they eat it—fish- </p><p>136 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> In some places fish are regarded with as</p><p>much repugnance by bushmen as human </p><p>flesh by Eurojjeans. If a party of natives </p><p>board a trading-ship and one of them is killed</p><p>while trying on his own initiative to murder </p><p>the trader, the others are likely as not </p><p>to go on bartering as if nothing had </p><p>happened. Such incidents have occurred </p><p>time and again. The unfortunate native </p><p>aspired to win distinction and failed. It </p><p>was his own lookout. </p><p> So it may be seen that their attitudes</p><p>may not be judged by white men's logic. </p><p>Anti in this respect it may not be amiss to </p><p>here mention the obscure sentence tucked </p><p>away in a little-known book that has con- </p><p>tributed enormously to the success of the </p><p>British Empire. In his Majesty’s “Hints </p><p>to Young Officers on Out Stations,” it is </p><p>specifically pointed out that natives are </p><p>not “inferior” to white men but merely </p><p>different. </p><p> Out of his long experience with natives,</p><p>Willerby knew that they were just about </p><p>as likely to greet him in a trading spirit </p><p>as with clubs. Nobody had been killed </p><p>the night before; there was nothing to </p><p>have engendered a special feeling of bitter- </p><p>ness. He rather expected that Williams </p><p>would make trouble, but that was a chance </p><p>he had to take if he wished to make trouble </p><p>for Williams. And he had come prepared. </p><p>In the day his white men were easily the </p><p>superiors of the blacks as rifle-shots, and </p><p>moreover he was in a way protected from </p><p>the ship by the brass cannon, the roar of </p><p>which carried much farther than its missile. </p><p> He did not head for the jetty but for the</p><p>stream, and the boats came stern-on to </p><p>shore and waited. For some minutes not </p><p>a native appeared, though everybody knew </p><p>the bush was full of them. Whether they </p><p>were to announce their presence with a </p><p>volley followed by howls or would come </p><p>slipping forward timidly with coconuts and </p><p>chickens for trade, was to be seen. </p><p> Presently a native edged into sight and</p><p>stood waiting. He took that more or less </p><p>risky method of finding out whether or not </p><p>the white men would shoot at him. But </p><p>Jackson stood up and greeted him with </p><p>shouts of welcome and waved a bottle of </p><p>whisky to show friendliness. Other natives </p><p>came out. They were urged to come closer </p><p>but were hesitant. They were unarmed, </p><p>which meant that they had left their arms </p><p>in the bush some ten or twenty feet away. </p><p> Jackson and W'illerby climbs out and</p><p> started wading up the beach. Behind them</p><p> rifles were held just below the gunwales,</p><p> ready in an instant to fire if needed.</p><p> Jackson and Willerby carried whisky,</p><p> tobacco and fish-hooks. They came up</p><p> to the sand and waited, holding out pres-</p><p> ents but insisting that the natives come for</p><p> them. An animal-trainer requires less pa-</p><p> tience than a irader. The. natives stood</p><p> and looked, now would take a step forward,</p><p> now retreat two, now squat, then stand,</p><p> walk three or four paces nearer, stop, go</p><p> backward and sit down.</p><p> Both white men swore feelingly, but they</p><p> knew it was part of the game and so wore</p><p> their friendliest smiles and never ceased</p><p> gestures of welcome and generosity.</p><p> And it rained, rained, rained.</p><p> Then Baraka came out. He showed that</p><p> he remembered Jackson, called to him</p><p> and stood looking hungrily toward the</p><p> bottle that Jackson carried.</p><p> “Hi, old boy, you fellow come catch</p><p>him? Jackson shouted. </p><p> “You no catch’em for shippy?” asked</p><p>Baraka, inquiring whether or not Jackson </p><p>was after labor recruits. </p><p> Baraka himself stood in no fear of being</p><p> nabbed by a blackbirder. He was too old.</p><p> But the others were much disturbed about</p><p> that. And long ago both Baraka and</p><p> Chief Ghorki had forgotten what Williams</p><p> had said about there being trouble if the</p><p> natives welcomed the Bebe.</p><p> “No, no,” Jackson expostulated. “Him</p><p> missionary shippy,” waving a broad hand</p><p> toward the Bebe. “No catch ’em black boys.</p><p> Give whiky, temback—plenty whiky.”</p><p> There was nothing incongruous to native</p><p> minds in that. Gopassans knew of mission-</p><p> aries only by the vaguest reports. Good</p><p> people, but foolish. Throughout the South</p><p> Seas the missionaries are called foolish,</p><p> even when influential. The Samoan word</p><p> for missionary is “afoolaAnd mission-</p><p> aries w'ere often—perhaps are yet—im-</p><p> personated by blackbirders.</p><p> “Come catch him,” Jackson finished.</p><p> ‘'Him,” “fellow,” “plenty,” “catch” and</p><p> “quick,” aided by pantomime, pretty well</p><p> dispenses with all interpreters. The na-</p><p> tives readily leam fragments of English;</p><p> they will under pressure leam a little of the</p><p> “oui cmi'’ as they call French, but it is as</p><p> if there were a taboo on all German</p><p> words. They will not or can not leam them.</p><p>Savages </p><p>137 </p><p> Baraka came forward carrying his child’s</p><p>rattle. </p><p> “Here, old boy, get a little o’ this m you.</p><p>said Jackson, opening the bottle and hand-</p><p>ing it to Baraka, who promptly drank long </p><p>and deep, coughing and spluttering over the </p><p>fiery liquor but delighted. </p><p> Other of the natives edged closer. More</p><p>bottles were opened. Tobacco was dis- </p><p>tributed. Fish-hooks were handed around. </p><p>A new supply of gifts was brought from the </p><p>boat. The natives were thick about them. </p><p> “Come to shippy—any time—plenty</p><p>whiky,” said the generous Willerby as he </p><p>passed out gifts with both hands. “But </p><p>no Williams, no Williams boys. No. Bad!” </p><p> The unutterable “badness” of Williams</p><p>was conveyed by Willerby’s face and </p><p>gestures rather than by liis words. </p><p> “That a he!” said a shrill voice, high-</p><p>pitched in rage. </p><p> Jackson and Willerby looked around and</p><p>saw a beautiful native girl, poised in anger, </p><p>flashing her dark eyes upon them. </p><p>WILLERBY had been long in the </p><p>tropics. He had seen hundreds, </p><p>thousands of native girls and been </p><p>susceptible to the charms of many. But </p><p>at that moment he thought Uala the most </p><p>beautiful of any he had ever seen. It wras </p><p>nol true perhaps. Beauty, like other things </p><p>that have superlatives, is comparative, and </p><p>the lithe Samoan belle was resplendent </p><p>among the flat-featured women of the </p><p>Solomons—blacker of skin than the Poly- </p><p>nesians and often, even when not in mourn- </p><p>ing, plastered with lime. </p><p> “Oh ho!” said Willerby.</p><p> “Whew!” Jackson commented.</p><p> “That a lie!” Uala repeated. “Misser</p><p>Williams good man!” </p><p> “Full o’ fire!” said Willerby admiringly.</p><p> Fie cast about for some present that</p><p>would be agreeable to feminine vanity, but, </p><p>when he looked up, Uala was gone. And </p><p>she had disobeyed Nauma by going within </p><p>speaking-distance of the Bebe men, but </p><p>the story she carried to his ears somewhat </p><p>palliated the offense: Bebe men were making </p><p>Gopassans fool drunk and telling them </p><p>Williams was bad man; much trouble </p><p>would come sure, and she hoped yaws, </p><p>cramps, bad dreams and sharks would get </p><p>every last one of the Gopassans! </p><p> Willerby did not lose sight of his main</p><p>purpose: to poison the natives with whisky </p><p>and words; also to find out what he could </p><p>about Williams, where his ship was and </p><p>anything else of the kind that might be </p><p>of value. But, familiar with native lore, he </p><p>did not forget Uala when he added pay to </p><p>generosity to get Baraka to make him a</p><p>love-charm. </p><p> In no place in the world, as among the</p><p>Solomons, are love or any other charms so </p><p>effective. Let a native know' that a witch- </p><p>doctor has prepared a “ghost-shooler” </p><p>against him, and that native will die. Let </p><p>a woman see a love-charm, made with devil- </p><p>devil magic, in the hands of a suitor, and, </p><p>though she be the wife of a chief, she will </p><p>yield. What the chief may afterward do </p><p>to her, to her lover or, if a bold chief, to the </p><p>wizard, is none of her concern. She would </p><p>no more think of resisting the charm than </p><p>of entering a tambu house. It simply is </p><p>not done, and that is all there is to it. </p><p> Willerby’s big red face beamed with</p><p>pleasure as the natives grew drunk and </p><p>noisy. He began to have hopes that </p><p>Williams might be killed—scuppered—and </p><p>toward that end gave broad hints, together </p><p>with pledges of valuable friendship. He </p><p>was well pleased with his work and made </p><p>Baraka well pleased with his attentions. </p><p>He made sport of the child’s rattle, told </p><p>him Williams had given him a “woman’s </p><p>toy” as an insult to the great devil-devil </p><p>spirits and, truthfully enough, tliat it </p><p>could not possibly affect the sun. </p><p> No. Willerby promised to give Baraka</p><p>information concerning the weather from </p><p>day to day and not to insult the devil- </p><p>devil spirits by presents of a “woman's toy.” </p><p>And Baraka was to make a love-charm and </p><p>give it to Uala, telling her that she could </p><p>not resist the affection of Willerby. It was </p><p>not usual for the wizard to have the suitor </p><p>present the charm by proxy, but Willerby </p><p>thought in this instance it was advisable. </p><p>He did not care to remain until Baraka </p><p>was sober enough to dabble with the magic </p><p>from his gourds. </p><p> The casks were filled, the full supply of</p><p>gifts distributed, and Willerby and his </p><p>party returned to the ship. </p><p> As Willerby came on deck, flushed and</p><p>pleased, he was met by Lania, who, clear- </p><p>eyed and fresh, carefully dressed, was alone </p><p>under the awning, waiting. He forgot all </p><p>about the dusky Uala. Lania was incom- </p><p>parable, and she then showed a spirit, a </p><p>vivacity which Willerby could not see was </p><p>138 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>forced but which had been markedly </p><p>lacking in her for some time. If Lania </p><p>had done as she wished, she would have gone </p><p>to her couch and wept: she was torn and </p><p>liarassed as she had never been.</p><p> No woman is ever her real self—or dis-</p><p>plays it—except in intense anger. She </p><p>wears robe over robe, herself unaware of </p><p>the number that clothe her nakedness. </p><p>Sometimes in the ecstasy of her first love </p><p>she will very nearly bare her soul, but for </p><p>her second and third, and after, she is dis- </p><p>guised as an actress. And Lania was old </p><p>in the ways of the world, and like all </p><p>women who are—being more so than even </p><p>the tender, wide-eyed maidens—she was </p><p>heart-hungry. But, being cynical-minded, </p><p>knowing men and women, too, she was, or </p><p>thought she was, wholly disillusioned. </p><p> Disillusionment, often as not, merely sub-</p><p>stitutes one illusion for another. She hated </p><p>Willerby; she hated Paul DuBeque; she </p><p>hated all whom she knew. She thought </p><p>it was love—deep, passionate, binding </p><p>love—she wanted: love that would anguish </p><p>her with intense delights. Women know </p><p>and always have known what psycho- </p><p>logists have only lately revealed to men: </p><p>that delight is edged with pain. Women </p><p>are the more passionate; and “passion,” as </p><p>the etymologists will tell all who ask means </p><p>literally “a state of suffering.” Lania </p><p>wanted love that would hurt; “true love” </p><p>it is called often by women who merely </p><p>misname “novelty.” </p><p> Women have so many various textured</p><p>and colored vestments about their naked </p><p>desires that not even in sincerest moments </p><p>can they distinguish between what they </p><p>try to conjure to them and what they really </p><p>want. </p><p> Lania had been loved. She could not</p><p>remember the times her face had been </p><p>lighted by men whose passions for her </p><p>burned them up. She had never loved </p><p>Willerby. At times she liked him, yes. </p><p>But he was an investment, and the pleasure </p><p>got from his company was that of being his </p><p>favorite, of wearing the black pearl ear- </p><p>rings, of seeing other women envious. </p><p> But other men had struck fire from her.</p><p>Clive Stanley—at any hour of night or day </p><p>that name streaked across her brain, Lania </p><p>felt something grip her flesh. Whatever </p><p>else may have caused that sensation, there </p><p>was fear, too. She had loved him with </p><p>flaming pa'ssion—and grown tired in time. </p><p>She always grew tired. But Clive Stanley </p><p>—she had told him how she hated her </p><p>husband; how he abused her, mistreated </p><p>her. And Stanley, the strangest man she </p><p>had ever known, brilliant, wealthy, bitter </p><p>against the world, had swept her into his</p><p>arms and carried her off. </p><p> But, before he tarried her, he made sure</p><p>that the husband would not follow.. The </p><p>dogs of justice had followed instead. They </p><p>caught Clive Stanley and hanged him for the </p><p>murder of her husband. They had hanged </p><p>him. There was no doubt of that. But </p><p>she was still afraid of him, afraid that he </p><p>was alive. There had been something </p><p>about the man that precluded the idea of </p><p>death touching him. It was all rather </p><p>vague and superstitious, but it troubled </p><p>her dreams. </p><p> Also there had been within easy remem-</p><p>brance Ballantyne, the son of the English </p><p>lord: that affair was only a matter of days, </p><p>tense and ending in violence. Always </p><p>something violent seemed to attend her. </p><p>He died. She fled. </p><p>yTHEN more recently there had been </p><p>another man. She had tried to, </p><p>rather than did, love him. She </p><p>told herself that she loved; perhaps all of </p><p>her life she would think that she really had: </p><p>at least she was grateful to his memory. </p><p>He had been from the world of gentlemen: </p><p>not of titles and registered blood, but of— </p><p>there is no other word to convey it—gentle- </p><p>men. Though a man of some years and </p><p>traveling, he had been innocent to believe </p><p>that one can tell enough about a woman </p><p>by looking at her, by talking to her, by </p><p>taking kisses from her mouth and—all </p><p>within a few weeks, to make her his </p><p>wife. </p><p> Lania had married him—but not until</p><p>Paul had assured her that there were </p><p>enough reasons for believing him wealthy </p><p>to take the chance. There were times </p><p>when she really thought that she would </p><p>have married him anyway. But Paul, like </p><p>the devil’s advocate with the book of her </p><p>life under his arm. stood ever behind her </p><p>ready to read her shame aloud and more </p><p>destructively than the horns of Jericho </p><p>shattered any wall with which love—“un- </p><p>profitable” love—tried to hedge her about. </p><p> She had gone with her husband, pleased</p><p>with his affection and joy rather than de- </p><p>lighted by her own. The feeling of security </p><p>Savages </p><p>139 </p><p>and comfort charmed her at first, but, like </p><p>a sailor who has scarcely slept ashore after </p><p>riding out a typhoon before he grows weary </p><p>of land’s solid footing, so she wished that </p><p>life might be a little more lively than placid </p><p>dinners, the quiet, reserved conversation</p><p>of callers, the boredom of dull theaters. </p><p>She knew she did not belong among the </p><p>people to whom her husband had brought </p><p>her—and that they knew it, no matter </p><p>how little they might show it. And, too, she </p><p>grew aweary of her husband’s satisfaction in </p><p>moon-gazing and the quiet words and </p><p>gentleness of his love-making. </p><p> Paul grew more weary than she of con-</p><p>ditions. He proposed a hideous relief. </p><p>With combined fright and repugnance she </p><p>had rebelled. But he had only to threaten </p><p>from the book of her life, and she grew </p><p>quiet. She did not agree; she simply </p><p>became impassive—then it was more with </p><p>that instinctive impulse to flee which </p><p>possesses all persons who have seen a wrong </p><p>done, taken even ever so passive a part in it, </p><p>than with relief and desire to be gone, that </p><p>she fled again to the vast seclusion of the </p><p>South Seas and to Willerby. </p><p> Ever since her return she had been</p><p>inwardly discontented, more so than ever </p><p>before. Willerby was, so to speak, un- </p><p>bearable^-and Paul DuBeque more so. </p><p>She wished to be well rid of them all. </p><p>There was no way out. Money was not </p><p>lacking, but it was in Paul’s hands. With </p><p>foresighted prodigality he had seen to it </p><p>that her wardrobe was all she wished, </p><p>but there was nothing beyond that. Yet </p><p>she was yet young, full of life’s hot energies; </p><p>also, heart-hungry. </p><p> When she had first laid her eyes on</p><p>Gilbert Lang, seen his clean, almost beau- </p><p>tiful boyish face, the gentlemanly though </p><p>youthful poise of him, vague things stirred </p><p>within her. The harder she stared at him </p><p>the less he seemed to resemble any one she </p><p>had met. He seemed so far from wherever </p><p>he belonged—so astray and alone among </p><p>the men one met around the islands. </p><p>Something about him fascinated her and </p><p>was reminiscent of something—she could </p><p>not remember what. She had not taken </p><p>her eyes from his face, and the whole of that </p><p>night she had scarcely taken her thoughts </p><p>from him—and, when she did, it had been </p><p>to think of Williams the berserker, who was </p><p>evidently closely connected with the boy. </p><p> She feared that Paul DuBeque would not</p><p>hesitate to stick a knife into the boy, and </p><p>she knew very well that Willerby could </p><p>readily find a wav to have him dropped </p><p>overboard. But Paul was very much </p><p>concerned with his broken jaw, and Wil- </p><p>lerby, too, at the moment had other matters </p><p>on his mind.</p><p> The next morning Paul stayed in bed.</p><p>Most of the others did, too. They sipped </p><p>coffee and rum on awakening and dozed </p><p>off again. Anything to put in the time, </p><p>to kill it. W'hen they awoke again, they </p><p>had another drink, and, when well saturated </p><p>with rum. they would get up. Lania, bored </p><p>as any, but more far-sighted, endured the </p><p>intolerable confinement of ship life without </p><p>recourse to stimulants in any such quan- </p><p>tities. She arose to a bath and a few </p><p>minutes of deep breathing, scrutinized her </p><p>face for wrinkles and plucked at the flesh </p><p>under her chin to see how distant was that </p><p>nightmare of the fleshy throat. She wasted </p><p>as much time in one way or another as the </p><p>others did in bed. </p><p> When she came on deck, Willerby and</p><p>his boats had gone ashore. There were no </p><p>sailors left but the while boatswain and </p><p>two or three natives to man the brass </p><p>cannon in case it was needed. As usual, </p><p>there was nothing to do. There were some </p><p>Minerva Press novels scattered about, a </p><p>few paper-backed French stories, but Lania </p><p>did not care for reading. Fiction bored </p><p>"her, and anything else was not always in- </p><p>telligible. Also as usual it was raining. </p><p> Lania stood about for some minutes; then</p><p>she hastened for the steward. </p><p> Where, she asked carelessly as one might</p><p>inquire for anything out of idle curiosity, </p><p>was that boy? </p><p> He was in one of the storerooms, irons on</p><p>his feet. Yes, the steward had the key. </p><p>Why had he been put there? The steward </p><p>did not know. Grogan had told him the </p><p>boy was to be kept there and the door was </p><p>to be kept locked. Certainly she could see </p><p>him. </p><p> The steward liked Lania. Most men did.</p><p>She was beautiful. </p><p>WHEN Lania stood in the opened </p><p>door, Gilbert Lang sat on the deck, </p><p>his head dejectedly propped against </p><p>his hands. About him were boxes and bar- </p><p>rels. He had been given nothing to break </p><p>the hardness of the deck. </p><p> He did not look up until he heard her</p><p>140 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>voice saying to the steward that she would </p><p>be all right and that she would lock the </p><p>door when she left. </p><p> Gilbert Lang remembered her. She was</p><p>the sort of a woman that is always remem- </p><p>bered: black-haired, black-eyed * a slender </p><p>oval face, long lashes and red lips; also</p><p>what might be called a multitude of hair, </p><p>black, glossy and fine. Vain as they are </p><p>of the glory, wom£n will never realize fully </p><p>until they begin clipping it how much of </p><p>their feminine distinction is due to their </p><p>hair. There never was, there never could </p><p>be, a clipped-headed sorceress. Lania’s </p><p>hair, had she worn it down, would have hung </p><p>in massive braids, and it was only by adroit </p><p>and studied arrangement that she escaped </p><p>a top-heavy appearance and made her </p><p>hair literally a crowning glory. </p><p> Gilbert Lang with some difficulty got</p><p>to his feet. </p><p> “You poor boy!" she said, unaffectedly.</p><p> “What are they going to do with me?”</p><p> “I don’t know. They are brutes!” She</p><p>was not posing. </p><p> “Have they caught Mr. Williams?”</p><p> “No, hardly! He—” she stopped. Then</p><p>gazing at him intently—“Would you do </p><p>what Willerby asked if he would turn you </p><p>loose?” </p><p> He shook his head slowly, and he looked</p><p>at her with something of disappointment in </p><p>his eyes, as much as to say— </p><p> “That is why you came!”</p><p> “You wouldn’t? Not ii they were going</p><p>to hurt you?” </p><p> “No.”</p><p> “You said he was no friend of yours.</p><p>You said it two or three times.” </p><p> “He isn’t what could be called a friend.</p><p>He hardly ever spoke to me. And some </p><p>way he seemed always angry. It made </p><p>me very uncomfortable, though I suppose </p><p>it is only his manner. He hates white men, </p><p>and I am beginning to understand why!” </p><p>“Did he hate you?” she asked. </p><p> “I don’t know. He seemed to at times.</p><p>I suppose he does—now.” </p><p> Gilbert Lang was thinking of how Wil-</p><p>liams had glared at him when he came upon </p><p>Uala and him under the palms. </p><p> “Didn't any one tell you what happened</p><p>last night?” </p><p> “What happened? No. T didn’t hear</p><p>anything. Did they get him?” </p><p> Then Lania told of how Williams had</p><p>come on board the Bebe—and left. </p><p> “He must be a wonder I” Gilbert Lang</p><p>exclaimed admiringly, for Lania had not </p><p>in any way minimized Williams’ blows. </p><p> “Men call him a hurricane. How did you</p><p>come to be with him, Mr. Gilbert?” </p><p> “Mr. Lang,” he corrected. “Gilbert</p><p>Lang.” </p><p> Then it was as if lightning had struck</p><p>Lania. By the flash of the bolt that </p><p>stunned her she saw what it was about </p><p>Gilbert Lang that had stirred vague things </p><p>within her. They were no longer vague. </p><p>The heart-hungriness that had seemed to </p><p>pull her toward him was rather the hungri- </p><p>ness and memory of his brother, Frank </p><p>Lang. This boy was her brother by law, </p><p>and the name of Gilbert, as “that kid </p><p>brother of mine,” had often been on Frank’s </p><p>lips. </p><p> There was scarcely a family resemblance,</p><p>for Gilbert was the more delicate, but </p><p>there was much suggestive of his mother. </p><p>Lania had sought him out largely through </p><p>restlessness and not through passion, but </p><p>within her w'as the feeling that she could </p><p>love him. Except for a certain untar- </p><p>nished youth, it w^s not because of Gilbert </p><p>Lang’s personality, but because of her own </p><p>discontent. </p><p> He saw that she was very much agitated,</p><p>and he asked w'hat was the matter. </p><p> Hers was a quick brain:</p><p> “I overheard Willerby and Paul say they</p><p>would have to put Lang out of the way. </p><p>Kill him. I didn’t know that was your </p><p>name! I thought it was Gilbert. Oh, </p><p>1 won’t let them kill you! I won’t!” </p><p> Fire flashed in Lania’s eves; her body</p><p>stiffened. She meant it. Of course, she </p><p>had overheard nothing of the kind, but, </p><p>while she had swiftly fabricated that in- </p><p>formation to cover her own agitation, she </p><p>nevertheless knew that either Paul Du- </p><p>Beque or Winston Willerby would readily </p><p>enough kill the boy. But that did not </p><p>begin to explain her attitude. There was </p><p>that deep, deep feeling of gratitude, amount- </p><p>ing to a tenderness more pervading than </p><p>any emotion she had ever called “love,” </p><p>for Gilbert Lang’s brother. He had been </p><p>a gentleman, and, though his presence was </p><p>sometimes wearisome, the memory of him, </p><p>his devotion, courtesy, worshipful inno- </p><p>cence, was dear to her. </p><p> In retrospect she appreciated him, his</p><p>home, his father and mother, and in her </p><p>retrospective bitterness at DuBeque for </p><p>Savages </p><p>141 </p><p>having robbed her of those things—much </p><p>more precious viewed from the tedious deck </p><p>of the Bebe than when they had been within </p><p>fingers’ reach—she neglected to remember, </p><p>utterly forgot and would have denied, that </p><p>she had been guiltily acquiescent in the </p><p>murder. True, there had been the book</p><p>of her life from which DuBeque threatened </p><p>to read, but, had she loved Frank Lang or </p><p>been another kind of woman, she would </p><p>have dared the harpies, given herself over </p><p>to be plucked by scandal and cast out and </p><p>have saved him from the poison which </p><p>DuBeque—her cousin, not her brother as </p><p>had been pretended under the name of </p><p>Brown—had managed to procure against </p><p>emergency from an old devil-doctor of the </p><p>Santa Cruzians—the most artful of South </p><p>Sea poisoners. </p><p> It did not at once occur to her why</p><p>Gilbert Lang was in the South Seas. The </p><p>thing that did bear in upon her was that </p><p>this boy should not be harmed. Without </p><p>at all reasoning the matter out—women </p><p>seldom reason anything out—she flamed </p><p>up with resolution. It was as if in a </p><p>vague, chaotic way she would try to atone </p><p>for the wrong done his brother. But she </p><p>had no clear idea of doing that; she did </p><p>not even think of it. Perhaps it might be </p><p>said that she felt it. </p><p> What women feel and what they think</p><p>do not necessarily have a logical con- </p><p>nection. The enigmatic quality in them, </p><p>intuition, that so baffles the male is like </p><p>the magic catpels of Arabian wizards and </p><p>carries them instantly from point to point. </p><p> “Why,” asked Gilbert Lang simply but</p><p>convinced, “should they want to kill </p><p>me?” </p><p> “Because they are that kind of men.</p><p>You hit Paul. That is reason enough for </p><p>him. And that Paul wants to do it is </p><p>reason enough for Willerby.” And she very </p><p>nearly voiced the wish, which was sincere, </p><p>that Williams had killed both! </p><p> “But look how they treated me!”</p><p> “Can you swim?” she asked.</p><p> He shook his head.</p><p> “I don’t know how you can get away</p><p>then.” </p><p> Bui may not Williams make them give</p><p>me up? I feel awfully for saying I was no </p><p>friend of his and-” </p><p> He can do nothing. If he comes any-</p><p>where near the ship, they will kill him.” </p><p> But surely men don’t commit murder</p><p>like that? Isn’t there any law? Nothing?” </p><p>It was of himself as much as Williams that </p><p>he was thinking. </p><p> “The Solomons are not like Philadelphia,</p><p>Gilbert Lang! War-ships make the laws— </p><p>and Willerby tells the officers what is right </p><p>and what is wrong, and he usually keeps </p><p>them so drunk that they believe him!”</p><p>“How did you know I came from Phila- </p><p>delphia?” he exclaimed. </p><p> It was a perilous slip, but she did not</p><p>hesitate: </p><p>“Williams said so. I don’t remember </p><p>just how, but he mentioned it in some way.” </p><p>“I don’t think I ever told him where my </p><p>home-” </p><p> “You must have,” she said definitely.</p><p>“Listen, I am going to bring you a revolver. </p><p>If anybody tries to hurt you, shoot! I’ll </p><p>see if it can be arranged so you can get </p><p>away.” </p><p>GILBERT LANG did not know </p><p>what to say. He was in the posi- </p><p>tion of believing her while feeling </p><p>it was unbelievable that anybody should </p><p>wish to kill him. He was grateful to her </p><p>but surprized at her intensity: she was </p><p>a stranger to him, yet there was a certain </p><p>indefinable intimacy about her, a kind of </p><p>intimate familiarity, which, combined with </p><p>her peculiarly vivid beauty, added some- </p><p>thing to his feeling of depression. Gilbert </p><p>Lang was not cast in the heroic mold; </p><p>whatever courage he may have had was </p><p>not the sort that made him a man of easy </p><p>adventures, and he had none of the facile </p><p>gallantry that carries men along dashingly </p><p>with strange women. </p><p> He thanked her, but she seemed scarcely</p><p>to hear "him. She went away and came back </p><p>with a revolver, loaded. Lania gave it to </p><p>him, urging him not to hesitate in using it. </p><p> She had some difficulty in not venturing</p><p>into dangerous questions. It flashed on </p><p>her as strange that Gilbert Lang should be </p><p>in the South Seas, yet she rejected the idea </p><p>that he had come to search her out. First, </p><p>she did not think it likely that she and </p><p>DuBeque had been tracked westward, </p><p>and also, being unable to imagine how little </p><p>Gilbert Lang had known of the South Seas, </p><p>she could not believe that he had come </p><p>into them, their myriad islands and great </p><p>distances, to look for her and DuBeque. </p><p> She did ask why a boy such as he was</p><p>there. </p><p>' 41'-' </p><p>• 1 </p><p>Ay </p><p>I42 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Gilbert Lang answered evasively even</p><p>as he looked at her, wanting to say some- </p><p>thing of how his ironed ankles and the </p><p>danger from Willerby seemed merely the </p><p>persistence of the tragedy that had come</p><p>on his family. </p><p> And she in turn could hardly repress the</p><p>name of “Alice Blown,” thinking of how </p><p>she could pretend to have known “Miss </p><p>Brown” and to have remembered “Miss </p><p>Brown’s” mentioning a Philadelphian fam- </p><p>ily of Langs. But common sense restrained </p><p>the name. </p><p> She left after urging him again not to</p><p>hesitate to use the revolver if he saw he </p><p>was in danger. Nothing had been said </p><p>that let him know DuBeque was in any way </p><p>tied to her by blood; nothing tliat had </p><p>revealed to him her name. She seemed </p><p>a very wonderful woman. But, in thinking </p><p>of her, he thought of Uala, and to think of </p><p>the two at once was in a degree to compare </p><p>them, not critically, not appraisingly but </p><p>as one might set side by side to view at once </p><p>some piece of earthwork out of Tuscany </p><p>and porcelain out of Limoges. He flushed </p><p>at remembrance of Uala, yet the charm </p><p>of her was evoked by the flush. </p><p> When Lania had left him, she went back</p><p>to the poop to await the return of Willerby. </p><p>She was very agitated and perturbed, know- </p><p>ing scarcely what to do—in fact, scarcely </p><p>knowing what to hope for. Then the devil </p><p>thrust a thought into her brain that thrilled </p><p>and frightened: supposing Paul DuBeque </p><p>were artfully egged on to remember his </p><p>threat against the boy and the boy killed </p><p>him! It would be the fate he deserved </p><p>and she w'ould be rid of DuBeque's spectral’ / </p><p>sinister shadow. She did not decide upon </p><p>it but nursed the thought tentatively, and </p><p>it.came to seem less revolting. </p><p> She soon regarded it as less of her own</p><p>planning than that of Nemesis, of justice. </p><p>Those seeking desired ends through violence </p><p>always manage with more or less sincerity </p><p>to put the full responsibility to God, </p><p>Destiny or the abstraction, Justice. It </p><p>is as if something innate within most </p><p>of mankind shrinks from murder, until— </p><p>as savages with their own hands make </p><p>monstrous images which can only be </p><p>satisfied with an altar-heap of dripping </p><p>heads—they have created some idea that </p><p>not only sanctions the killing but often </p><p>commands it: vengeance, by the avenger, </p><p>anyway, is always looked upon as an un- </p><p>masked headsman who wears the insignia </p><p>of Justice. </p><p> Lania never gave such matters as these</p><p>even a trace of thought, but by the same </p><p>psychological processes just mentioned she </p><p>arrived at the feeling that it w'ould be right</p><p>for DuBeque to die by the hand of Gilbert </p><p>Lang. </p><p> And so almost resolved, thrilled, appear-</p><p>ing vivacious, but agitated, she stood </p><p>awaiting the coming of Willerby. </p><p> And he came proud and boastful. He</p><p>gloated over the way he had turned Gopassa </p><p>into a drunken village, seduced Baraka </p><p>into dislike for Williams and prepared what </p><p>he thought would be death-dealing trouble </p><p>for the alien Samoans and Tongans. </p><p> TO BE CONTINUED</p><p>AGENT Amy </p><p> IBy</p><p>THIS SELL A. BOGGS </p><p>Author of “The Cool Hand” </p><p>CARRICK, superintendent of the </p><p>Northern Division of the R. S. </p><p>&amp; T. railroad, had the reputa- </p><p>tion of being an obstinate man, </p><p>one difficult to persuade from any view </p><p>but his own, and it was said of him that </p><p>he never forgot anything, good or bad. </p><p>This being the case, it is not strange that </p><p>he should keep in mind the first dereliction </p><p>of Andy Peck, agent at Belham. </p><p> It was in the Spring of the year 1916</p><p>that Superintendent Carrick started out </p><p>with the general manager and several </p><p>general superintendents and a number of </p><p>other officials of high and low degree on a </p><p>trip of inspection. They came to Belham </p><p>on their special train and found the station </p><p>locked and the agent absent. They waited </p><p>and fussed around for the better part of </p><p>ten minutes, the general manager and the </p><p>other high officials casting coldly question- </p><p>ing glances at the fuming Carrick and in- </p><p>quiring of one another—in distantly om- </p><p>inous voices that they made certain the </p><p>luckless superintendent would hear—what </p><p>sort of a doings was this? But no agent </p><p>came, and the inspection of the Belham </p><p>station was abandoned. The special rolled </p><p>away with its indignant passengers. </p><p> You may be sure that a subsequent</p><p>investigation came. Oh, yes! And this </p><p>investigation brought out the' fact that, </p><p>while tie high and mighty members of the </p><p>•inspection party were wasting a precious </p><p>ten minutes in vain waiting for Andy Peck. </p><p>,lDan Kurrie's Inning," elc. </p><p>to come and let them in so they could </p><p>have a look-see, said Andy was calmly </p><p>stretched out on the chair in a barber-shop </p><p>several minutes walk distant from the </p><p>depot, receiving certain tonsorial atten- </p><p>tions.</p><p> “You kept us waiting for that!” stormed</p><p>Carrick. “Kept us waiting while you got </p><p>a shave and a hair-cut!’' </p><p> “And a shampoo,” corrected young Andy</p><p>with proper humility. </p><p> His face was perfectly sober, though</p><p>inwardly he was feeling somehow mighty </p><p>pleased with himself. For this, you must </p><p>understand, was before he had met Ina, </p><p>the miller’s daughter, and learned responsi- </p><p>bility. </p><p> “It’s the most outrageous thing I ever</p><p>heard of!” gasped the superintendent, </p><p>glaring. </p><p> “Business was slack,” murmured the</p><p>wicked Andy. “And I didn’t know you </p><p>were coming.” He sighed. “If \rou’d only </p><p>sent me word.” </p><p> Carrick glared some more. Send word,</p><p>indeed—and spoil the very purpose of the </p><p>inspection. </p><p> “We’ll see!’’ he cried and pounded the</p><p>top of the desk. “We’ll lay vou off for </p><p>thirty days for this offense! And mind </p><p>this: if ever again I find you absent from </p><p>your office when you should be on duty, </p><p>I’ll discharge you completely!” </p><p> So Andy got his thirty days. But he</p><p>didn’t care—enjoyed the enforced vacation, </p><p>144	Adventure</p><p>in fact. In those thirty days he got properly </p><p>acquainted with the folks of Belham </p><p>town—to which he hail but shortly come. </p><p>And, best of all, he met black-eyed Ina, </p><p>daughter of Duncan, the miller. </p><p> The more he met Ina the more Andy</p><p>became convinced that this Belham job </p><p>was just the thing for him. And, as the </p><p>days passed, Ina came to agree with him. </p><p>So, by the fime Summer had gone and early </p><p>Fall had come, things between them were </p><p>pretty well settled. </p><p> “There’s Lane’s little bungalow,” he</p><p>said one evening. “It’ll be empty the first </p><p>of November.” </p><p> “Well—” she hesitated, coloring prettily.</p><p> “Set the day,” he insisted.</p><p> “Well—yes, all right!” She placed her</p><p>hand on his arm. “Just give me a day </p><p>or two to decide, Andy,” she said—just </p><p>like a woman. </p><p>BUT the very next afternoon Super- </p><p>intendent Carrick dropped off a </p><p>slowly moving freight as it passed </p><p>Belham depot. He tried the waiting-room </p><p>door; it was unlocked, and he entered. </p><p>He tried the office door; it was locked. </p><p> He rattled the knob of the office door</p><p>vigorously. No response. He peered in </p><p>through the glass of the closed ticket </p><p>window. No one in sight. He went </p><p>outside and peered through the front office </p><p>window, where he had a complete view of </p><p>the interior. No person was within. </p><p> “Ah, ha!” said Carrick and went back</p><p>into the silent waiting-room and seated </p><p>himself. </p><p> A half-hour passed. No agent. Forty-</p><p>five minutes. Still no agent. The super- </p><p>intendent rose, stumped out of the building </p><p>and started to walk down the track. </p><p> On a short siding just west of the station</p><p>stood six camp-cars, the quarters of the </p><p>members of the steel gang, at present la\*ing </p><p>steel rail near Belham, and all colored— </p><p>brought from the South during the past </p><p>Summer. As Carrick was passing one of </p><p>the cars, he heard voices speaking behind </p><p>its closed door. He paused. </p><p> “I don’ know, Mistuh Agent,” said one</p><p>speaker. “ ‘Steamboat,’ he say-” </p><p> “Don’t you listen to Steamboat,” cut</p><p>in the unmistakable voice of Agent Andy </p><p>Peck. “You listen to me. I’m telling </p><p>you the truth.” </p><p> Carrick waited for no more. He shoved</p><p> that door open with a bang. Seated on</p><p>the edge of a wooden bunk were two colored </p><p>men—one with a bandaged foot, the other </p><p>with a wrapped-up hand. On a soap-box </p><p>opposite them sat Andy. </p><p> “Is this where you spend your time now?”</p><p>asked Carrick grimly. </p><p> The agent looked a little dismayed.</p><p> “I can explain—” he began.	•</p><p> “Come out here,” interrupted the super-</p><p>intendent. “I’ve something to say to </p><p>you.” </p><p> The agent descended from the car and</p><p>followed Carrick. Out of earshot of the </p><p>big-eyed colored men the superintendent </p><p>stopped and faced Peck. </p><p> “You remember what I told you last</p><p>Spring,” he said firmiy to the agent. </p><p>“You ve been absent from your office for </p><p>at least forty-five minutes this afternoon. </p><p>I know, because I was at the station waiting. </p><p>You’re done—fired.” </p><p> “But you ought to let me explain,”</p><p>remonstrated Andy. “I was working for </p><p>the interests of the R. S. &amp; T. when I was </p><p>in that camp-car just now.” </p><p> “Likely!’’ scoffed Carrick.</p><p> Peck flushed.</p><p> “Yes, sir,” jje affirmed steadily. “These</p><p>steel gang boys are threatening to quit and</p><p>go back South. They’re worrying about </p><p>the coming Winter up North here—afraid, </p><p>if they stay, they’ll freeze. One of the gang </p><p>is egging the others to go—a fellow they </p><p>call Steamboat Jackson. I’ve been trying </p><p>to queer his efforts and persuade them to </p><p>stay; that’s why I was talking to those two </p><p>men when you came.” </p><p> Carrick listened incredulously until Andy</p><p>finished his tale. </p><p> “Bosh!” he snapped.</p><p> “It’s the truth,” declared Andy.</p><p> He kept his mind fixed on Ina and thus</p><p>was able to choke back the hot words </p><p>that surged to his lips. </p><p> “No matter,” said Carrick shortly. &lt;fI</p><p>don’t believe they’ll leave—and, even if </p><p>they should, it’s none of your affair. Your </p><p>business was to stay in your office and take </p><p>care of tilings there. Anyhow, you re </p><p>done. I’ll have a man here in a couple of </p><p>days to relieve you.” </p><p> Andy saw it was useless to talk any fur- v</p><p>ther to the headstrong superintendent. </p><p> “Very good,” he said.</p><p> Turning on his heel, he walked toward</p><p>the depot. </p><p>Agent Andy </p><p>145 </p><p>n </p><p>yIT WAS that very Thursday eve- </p><p>ning that Track Supervisor Quinn, </p><p>of the maintenance-of-way depart- </p><p>ment, entered the superintendent’s office </p><p>at Wharton, division headquarters, twenty </p><p>miles east of Belham. </p><p> “I don’t know,” said Quinn to Carrick</p><p>abruptly, “but I’m afraid our colored steel </p><p>gang is not going to stick with us. Now </p><p>that there’s a nip of frost in these Fall morn- </p><p>ings, they’re getting restless; their thoughts </p><p>are turning back to their sunny South.” </p><p> Carrick looked up quickly. Recollection</p><p>of what Agent Peck had said that afternoon </p><p>flashed through his head. </p><p> “You think so?” he said, frowning.</p><p> “Yes,” returned 'Quinn. “They’ve an</p><p>exaggerated idea of the severity of our </p><p>Northern Winter. That’s one trouble. </p><p>And another is that they’re continually </p><p>being stirred up by the more shiftless, </p><p>restless spirits among them—by one man </p><p>named Steamboat, especially. If we only </p><p>could discreetly eliminate both troubles!” </p><p> More confirmation of what Peck had</p><p>said. Carrick’s face grew more dour. </p><p>But no difference, he decided; Relief Agent </p><p>Manott had already been instructed to</p><p>relieve Peck the coming Monday. And, </p><p>anyway, these agents ought to learn their </p><p>place; Peck had not been called on to take </p><p>a hand with the steel gang. </p><p> “That agent at Belham was saying some-</p><p>thing along the same line,” he observed </p><p>aloud, however. </p><p> “Andy Peck,” said Quinn. “Yes, he</p><p>knows. Good boy; been trying to keep ’em </p><p>straight. It will be little less than a calamity </p><p>for us if we can’t hold them,” he went on. </p><p>“Now that practically all the foreigners </p><p>have gone back to the old countries to get </p><p>in the big mix-up over there—and even </p><p>those who didn’t have entered the mills </p><p>and factories—our last reserve, our last </p><p>hope, is the colored labor from the South. </p><p>You’ve said yourself that we absolutely </p><p>must get this new rail laid to stand the </p><p>heavy traffic that’s coming this Winter and </p><p>next ^ Spring. The old steel that we’re </p><p>replacing is done for, as you know. If we </p><p>should be compelled to try to make it stand </p><p>up under the demand that will be made </p><p>upon it, we’re going to be left in a sad </p><p>state.” </p><p> Carrick knew that this was sober truth.</p><p> 10</p><p>But he refused to be convinced that the </p><p>steel gang situation was serious. </p><p> “It’s probably just talk,” he said. “I</p><p>don’t believe they’ll actually go.” </p><p> “I’m afraid of it,” persisted Quinn.</p><p>“However, I believe that, if we could </p><p>eliminate the uneasy element that keeps </p><p>the others in a state of unrest, we could </p><p>calm their fears about the coming cold </p><p>weather. But the eliminating would have </p><p>to be done in a most diplomatic manner. </p><p>The whole gang is at the skittish point, </p><p>ready to jump at the first move that looks </p><p>suspicious to them. If we fire one and he </p><p>goes, the entire crowd goes. That’s the </p><p>way I figure it.” </p><p> “Well,” said Carrick, “what are you going</p><p>to do about it?” It was plain that he still </p><p>was skeptical about the supervisor’s fears. </p><p> “I'm stumped,” said Quinn glumly.</p><p>“I’m worried sick about the whole busi- </p><p>ness.” He walked toward the door. “And </p><p>I’m expecting there’ll be some sort of a </p><p>crisis within the next few days, too.” </p><p> “Oh, bother!” said Carrick. “It’s prob-</p><p>ably nothing. But, if you really are </p><p>alarmed, do whatever you think best.” </p><p> “I would,” said Quinn, “if I only knew</p><p>what was best. I’m trying to think up </p><p>something.”</p><p> He went out.</p><p>m </p><p>THE steel gang was holding forth </p><p>down at the far edge of the station </p><p>platform, gathered in a ring at the </p><p>edge of the circle of light made by the single </p><p>platform lamp there. </p><p> The early October moon tipped the</p><p>eastern hills. The evening still was warm </p><p>after the balmy windless day. By morning </p><p>the colored men might be shivering under </p><p>Jack Frost’s caress, but tonight their hearts </p><p>were light. The reason was simple. The </p><p>coming Saturday, less than forty-eight </p><p>hours away, would be pay-day. So now, </p><p>this Thursday evening, by turns they </p><p>clogged, buck-and-winging with fantastic </p><p>and grotesque shufflings of the feet, the on- </p><p>lookers applauding with boisterously en- </p><p>thusiastic cries. At frequent intervals their </p><p>voices rose in song—wonderfully har- </p><p>monious, vibrate with natural melody. </p><p> Andy Peck, having nothing much to do</p><p>just then but wait until the last evening </p><p>passenger-train, No. 73&lt;should arrive, stood </p><p>146 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>in Lhe waiting-room doorway and for a time </p><p>dispiritedly watched the merrymaking down </p><p>at the far end of tlie freight house. lie </p><p>certainly was feeling blue. </p><p>AFTER supper he had stopped </p><p>in at Duncan’s before returning </p><p>to Lhe station. Ina had met him </p><p>at Lhe door. By his expression she imme- </p><p>diately perceived that he brought bad news. </p><p> “Our wedding is off—for a while!” he</p><p>blurted out. “i’ve been fired.” </p><p> “Oh, Andy!” she faltered. “How? Why?”</p><p>Into her sympathetic ears he quickly </p><p>poured his sad tale. </p><p> “The nasty old thing!” she said in-</p><p>dignantly when he had finished. “I’d just </p><p>like to get my fingers in his hair a minute; </p><p>I'd shake some sense into him!” </p><p> It is indicative of Andy’s extreme misery</p><p>that he did not even smile at that—the </p><p>superintendenl’s crown being so devoid of </p><p>hair that it would have been impossible to </p><p>get anything approximating a grasp of it. </p><p> “I was looking at Lane’s bungalow, too,”</p><p>she continued. “Just this afternoon. -It’s </p><p>-—it’s the dearest little house.” She put </p><p>her face close to his. “Couldn’t we— </p><p>couldn’t we be married anyway, Andy?” </p><p>“We could,” he replied, “but we won’t. </p><p>Not till I get a job.” </p><p> “You could find one afterward,” she said.</p><p>“I’ll find one first,” he had answered, </p><p>and forthwith he had lorn himself away. </p><p> For, despite his firmness, he felt himself</p><p>weakening, and that, he felt, was a poor </p><p>tiling to do under the circumstances. </p><p>IN CONSEQUENCE Andy now </p><p>brooded in the doorway of the </p><p>station while he contemplaled the </p><p>steel gang. Presently he strolled </p><p>toward them, found a spike keg </p><p>lying near the side of the freight house, </p><p>up-ended it and sat down just outside the </p><p>circle of light. One “Memphis Joe” was </p><p>performing at the time. Directly Mem- </p><p>phis—as he was called for short—cut a </p><p>final figure in his clog and concluded his </p><p>whirl. </p><p> “ ’Nough!” he cried and dropped down</p><p>against the freight house, close to where </p><p>Andy sat. </p><p> Cries now arose for “Steamboat! Steam-</p><p>boat!” Faces were turned expectantly </p><p>toward the side of the ring directly opposite </p><p>the agent. </p><p>lively </p><p>down </p><p> “Git in, Steamboat! Hit ’er up!”</p><p> “Shake dem feeL, Steamboat!”</p><p> “Show us-all whut you got!”</p><p> But Sleamboat Jackson, burly and tall</p><p>and extremely black, morosely shook his </p><p>head. Of all the crowd he was Lhe single </p><p>man—besides Andy—who appeared down- </p><p>hearLed. </p><p> “No, suli!” he said, a trace of sullenness</p><p>in his voice. </p><p> “Come on, Steamboal! Be a spobt!”</p><p>“No, suh!” reiteratedSleamboat. “Don1 </p><p>boLher me!” </p><p> Thereupon, perceiving that Steamboat</p><p>was not Lo be moved, anoLher aspiranl for </p><p>acclaim stepped to the center. Agent Andy </p><p>leaned over toward Memphis Joe. </p><p> “What’s the matler with. Steamboat,</p><p>Memphis?” </p><p> “Don’ know, Mistuh Agent. Steamboat,</p><p>he’s had a grouch on all day. He didn’ </p><p>go ouL with the gang—didn’ help lay no </p><p>rail a-lall today.” </p><p> “Sore at Lhe foreman?”</p><p> Memphis Joe shook his head.</p><p> “No, I don’ Lhink so. Don’ know jest</p><p>whul ’tis.” </p><p> “Maybe he's worrying about the coming</p><p>cold weather,” suggesied Andy. “Maybe </p><p>he wants to Lravel SouLh?” </p><p> “Thai mighl be." agreed Memphis. “I</p><p>heard him say no col’ weather wasn’t goin’</p><p>ketch him up here. He’s blowed that, </p><p>w'en he did go South ag'in, he’s goin’ well- </p><p>heeled—with his pockels full ’nough to </p><p>keep him ’thout workin’ till nex’ Spring.” </p><p>“And he hasn’l got the money yet, eh?” </p><p>“No, suh! Jest this minute I bet Steam- </p><p>boat ain’t got ’nough in his jeans to take </p><p>him half-way back Lo Mcksburg, whar he </p><p>come from.” </p><p> “Well, day afler tomorrow is pay-day,”</p><p>observed Andy. “He’ll gel some ihen.” </p><p>“He’ll draw ’bout the same as me for </p><p>the las’ two weeks,” replied Memphis. </p><p>“ ’Bout forty dollars. An’ forty dollars </p><p>ain’t goin’ keep no man over Winter.” </p><p>“That’s right,” assenled Peck. “So </p><p>then, if Steamboat goes back soon, it looks </p><p>like his blow was no good?” </p><p> “Sure do! An’ say,'Boss, I liadn’</p><p>thoughl of ii much before, bul I’ll bet you’ve </p><p>done hi I il! I’ll bet that’s whut is puttin’ </p><p>Steamboal in sech a stedy. He wants that </p><p>money so’s he kin hole up this Winter down </p><p>in Vicksburg—an’ he ain’t got it! An’, </p><p>whut’s mo’, he ain’t li’ble to gil il fore col’ </p><p>Agent Andy </p><p>147 </p><p>weather comes, an’, w’en col’ weather does </p><p>come, he don’ want to be here! ’ </p><p> “I understand Steamboat wants the rest</p><p>of you boys to go back with him? said </p><p>Andy abruptly. </p><p> Memphis shifted uneasily.</p><p> “I’ve heerd some talk,” he admitted.</p><p>“Steamboat’s been tellin’ stuff.’’ </p><p> “He’s talking through his hat,” said</p><p>Andy. And then, as Memphis kept silent, </p><p>he added, “They tell me Steamboat is a </p><p>bad actor when he gets going good?” </p><p>Memphis cast a wary glance at the </p><p>sullen, glum Steamboat. </p><p> “ ’Deed, Mistuh Agent, that’s right!</p><p>W’en Steamboat starts to spread hisself, </p><p>other folks jest sort o’ ease back! They do </p><p>if they’s* wise.” </p><p> No. 73’s whistle sounded far up the track.</p><p>Andy Peck rose from his keg. </p><p> “Well, it looks like hard luck for Steam-</p><p>boat; I guess he'll have to stay here or else </p><p>go without hi3 roll.” </p><p> Memphis Joe also got up. He dropped</p><p>his voice carefully. </p><p> “It does,” he agreed. “But I b’lieve he’s</p><p>goin’—roll or no roll. I’se only hopin’, </p><p>though, that, if he does go, he goes ’thout </p><p>raisin’ no ruckus like he done las’ pay-day. </p><p>If he does start a ruckus, it’s dead sure all </p><p>the rest or us colored boys goin’ to leave</p><p>whether we was aimin’ to or not.” </p><p> No. 73’s deep whistle drowned out any</p><p>reply Andy might have attempted. He </p><p>hurried toward his baggage truck. </p><p>IV </p><p> V</p><p>fajj ON FRIDAY afternoon Steamboat </p><p>imui Jackson, sprawled in the sunshine </p><p>just around a protected corner of </p><p>the depot building, heard a rapid put-put up </p><p>the tracks. A quick glance in that direc- </p><p>tion revealed to him that the sound was </p><p>made by Supervisor Quinn’s motor speeder </p><p>as it swiftly drew nearer the station. </p><p>Steamboat quickly decided it might be </p><p>best not to let the supervisor see him lying </p><p>around the depot instead of being out </p><p>laying rails with the rest of the steel gang. </p><p>Not that Steamboat cared much—but it </p><p>would save useless talk. </p><p> At once the colored man rose and slunk</p><p>around to the back of the depot building, </p><p>it being too late for him to regain the shelter </p><p>of the string of camp-cars that the </p><p>steel gang used. He paused near the </p><p>rear window of the agent’s little office. </p><p> The supervisor’s speeder drew up to the</p><p>station and stopped. Stepping off,,• Quinn </p><p>lifted the wheels from the rails and rolled </p><p>the speeder back from the tracks. Then </p><p>he entered the station, going into the office </p><p>where Andy Peck sat at his desk, com- </p><p>pleting his daily accounts. As the after- </p><p>noon was rather warm, the agent had </p><p>slightly raised the rear office window for </p><p>ventilation. The voices of Peck and Quinn </p><p>carried out clearly to the squatting Steam- </p><p>boat. </p><p> “Hello, Andy!” said Quinn. “How’re</p><p>things today?” </p><p> “Poor,” responded the agent. “Rotten!”</p><p>This was so different from the usually </p><p>blithe Andy’s speech that the supervisor </p><p>stared in surprize. </p><p> “Why?” he exclaimed. “What’s the</p><p>trouble?” </p><p> “Been canned,” jerked out Andy. “Yes-</p><p>terday—by the right honorable Mr. Car- </p><p>rick. Am waiting now for the relief man; </p><p>expect he’ll get here about Monday.” </p><p>“Tell me about it,” pressed Quinn. </p><p> Peck did. When he was through, the</p><p>supervisor whistled softly. </p><p> “The dickens!” he said. ^He was silent</p><p>a moment. “Of course, I can’t say much— </p><p>but you know how I feel.” </p><p> “Thanks,” replied Andy. “But let’s talk</p><p>about something else. What’s on your</p><p>own mind today?” </p><p> “Trouble, too,” said Quinn. “Nothing</p><p>but trouble. I’m trying to fix a way to </p><p>get these steel gangers to stick with us. </p><p>Foreman Walsh tells me there’s open talk </p><p>among the men that most of them are going </p><p>to leave right after they get their pay to- </p><p>morrow. It’s that Steamboat fellow who’s </p><p>prodding them to it.” </p><p> “I know they’re nervous,” said Andy.</p><p>“As 1 told the old man yesterday, I was </p><p>down in that camp-car doing a little pro- </p><p>paganda stuff. But he couldn’t see it.” </p><p> “I understand,” said Quinn warmly.</p><p>“I appreciate what you’ve done, even if he </p><p>doesn’t.” He paused. “If we could only </p><p>eliminate that Steamboat without scaring </p><p>the others off, I believe we could hold ’em. </p><p>Just now it looks as if his influence over </p><p>them was great enough to get them to do </p><p>what he wants. But, if we could get rid </p><p>of him in the right way or could overcome </p><p>his influence in some manner, I believe </p><p>they’d stay here.” </p><p>148 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Have you anything in mind?"</p><p> “Oh, I have a little scheme,” answered</p><p>Quinn, “but I’ll admit I have my doubts </p><p>of its success. Anyway, that's my chief </p><p>reason for coming to see you today." </p><p> “Let's hear about it,” urged Andy.</p><p> “It’s just this. We’re going to try a</p><p>little psychology on the steel gangers— </p><p>going to pay them in cash tomorrow instead </p><p>of with the usual checks. A bunch of bills </p><p>in a colored man's hand looks a lot bigger </p><p>to him than a little slip of paper, even if </p><p>the paper is worth as much." </p><p> “I see," said Peck. “You're figuring</p><p>that, when a man sees all that ready cash </p><p>in his fist and realizes that he can get as </p><p>much more every two weeks if he stays on </p><p>the job. he’s not going to be so ready to </p><p>leave right off.” </p><p> “Exactly," stated the supervisor. “You</p><p>can see for yourself, though, that it’s not </p><p>much to base our hopes on. But we’re </p><p>going to give it a trial." </p><p> “How you going to pay them?" asked</p><p>Andy. </p><p> “That’s where you come in," answered</p><p>Quinn. “We’re going to send a special pay- </p><p>roll out to you and let you do it." </p><p> “But how about the money?" questioned</p><p>Andy. “Where’s it to come from?” </p><p> At this question the attentive Steamboat</p><p>pricked up his ears.</p><p> “That’ll come with the pay-roll sheets,”</p><p>replied Quinn. His words reached Steam- </p><p>boat distinctly. “Sheets and money will </p><p>be done up in a package and will reach </p><p>you tonight on No. 73. That’ll give you </p><p>a chance to go over it and get things </p><p>lined up befefre the men call tomorrow </p><p>morning. The money will be in bills— </p><p>about three thousand dollars.” </p><p> A sort of gentle sigh escaped Steamboat.</p><p>Three thousand dollars! Many, many </p><p>times the amount that would keep him in </p><p>comfort, in luxury, over Winter. To- </p><p>morrow he’d draw around forty dollars. </p><p>That forty dollars, plus seven dollars and </p><p>thirty cents—the latter amount almost </p><p>wholly the result of a recent lucky session </p><p>at craps—represented his total assets. </p><p>Steamboat sighed deeply again. Three </p><p>thousand dollars! He hearkened once more </p><p>to the conversation within the office. </p><p> “All right,” Agent Peck was saying.</p><p>“Let it come. I’ll do my best—even though </p><p>the old man has given me the can. I </p><p>haven’t any safe here, though, to keep </p><p>the money in overnight. And there’s no </p><p>bank in town.” </p><p> “Take it home with you?”</p><p> “No,” objected Andy. “That’d throw</p><p>me responsible if the stuff should dis- </p><p>appear.” </p><p> There was silence for a moment. Then</p><p>Quinn spoke: </p><p> “in that case, then, I expect the only</p><p>thing to do will be to conceal it some </p><p>place here in the office. It ought to be safe </p><p>enough, especially as no one else needs to </p><p>know it’s here." </p><p> “It ought to be," assented Andy. “Any-</p><p>way, that’s what I'll have to do.” </p><p> “Sure, it’ll be all right,” said Quinn.</p><p>He walked toward the door. “Well, I’ll </p><p>have to be moving along. Hasn’t been </p><p>any trouble since last pay-day, has there? </p><p>Men behaving?” </p><p> “No; no trouble since,” replied Andy.</p><p>“The colored boys are doing as well as </p><p>could be expected, I guess.” </p><p> “Just what did happen last time?” asked</p><p>Quinn. “I never did hear precisely, and </p><p>I’ve been wanting to ask you. Trouble </p><p>with the townfollc, wasn't it?” </p><p> “Yes. A few of the steel gangers got a</p><p>little too much gin and made some excite- </p><p>ment up-town. 1 wasn’t there myself, </p><p>but the next day I heard there’d been </p><p>threats made. Some of the white folks </p><p>were for coming down here and cleaning</p><p>out the camp-cars. I heard they claimed </p><p>they’d do it if the colored men started </p><p>anything again.” </p><p> “That’s the deuce of it—when they get</p><p>a little booze!” said Quinn. “Well, let’s </p><p>trust they’ll behave. But, if anything </p><p>should break loose, you wire to head- </p><p>quarters, and we’ll get some of our raiJroad </p><p>cops out here quick. A man can’t fool with </p><p>that sort of thing. No telling.” </p><p> “All right,” responded Andy. “But I</p><p>guess there’s not much danger. Mostly </p><p>hot air, I expect.” </p><p> “Hope so,” said the supervisor. “But</p><p>don’t take any chances. So long. I'll </p><p>drop in tomorrow and see how things are </p><p>working out.” </p><p> V</p><p>IT WrAS shortly after dark Friday </p><p>evening when Andy Peck stepped </p><p>around the end of the station to get </p><p>the baggage truck there and pull it out to </p><p>the front, ready for No. 73’s arrival. Loud </p><p>Agent Andy </p><p>149 </p><p>laughter and singing came from most of the </p><p>camp-cars that stood on the siding west </p><p>of the station. The car that stood nearest </p><p>to the depot was that wherein Steamboat </p><p>Jackson and some of his special cronies </p><p>abode. Andy paused and listened for a </p><p>few moments. From this last car came </p><p>the loudest of the sounds—and the sounds </p><p>were neither those of laughter nor singing. </p><p>High, declamatory voices sounded there, </p><p>and the words that floated out were plenti- </p><p>fully besprinkled with oaths. </p><p> A voice came from the rear comer of the</p><p>station, close at hand/ </p><p> “Mistuh Agent!”</p><p> “Yes?” answered Andy. The voice,</p><p>though low-pitched, was unmistakably that </p><p>of Memphis Joe. “What is it, Memphis?” </p><p>“Step over close here, please. I don’ </p><p>want none them other steel gangers see me </p><p>talkin’ to you.” </p><p> Wondering, Andy moved over into the</p><p>gloom of the corner. </p><p> “What’s the matter, Memphis?”.</p><p>“Mistuh Agent, I don’ like the way </p><p>that Steamboat man is actin’!” Memphis </p><p>spoke with swift earnestness. “He’s done </p><p>got sev’ral bottles gin some’eres, an’ he’s </p><p>been settin’ up the drinks to that crowd </p><p>of his in his camp-car. They all cert’nly </p><p>been talkin’ high an’ free this las’ hour or </p><p>so. I been listenin’.” </p><p> “I was trying to hear them myself just</p><p>now,” said Peck. “What they talking </p><p>about, Memphis—you know?” </p><p> “They’s aimin’ to make big trouble,</p><p>Mistuh Agent—an’ that’s a fact! Some </p><p>folks, white an’ colored, bound to git hurt </p><p>if Steamboat’s crowd do whut they’s </p><p>blowin’!” </p><p> “And what’s next?”</p><p> “Whut I tol’ you las’ night—like Steam-</p><p>boat an’ his gang done up at Scanlon’s </p><p>s’loon las’ pay-day. They’s blowin’ they’s </p><p>goin’ back up there tonight an’ make the </p><p>townfolks stan’ round!” </p><p> “You don’t say!” exclaimed Andy. “But</p><p>do you think they’ll really try it?” </p><p> Memphis spoke with conviction.</p><p> “They got lot o’ gin in ’em,” he declared.</p><p>“An’ some colored folks li’ble do most </p><p>anything w’en they gits the booze. They’ll </p><p>try it; that’s cert’n!” </p><p> “That’s bad!" said Andy, frowning in the</p><p>darkness. </p><p> “Yes, suh!” affirmed Memphis. “Goin’</p><p>make big trouble for lot o’ us colored folks </p><p>whut don’ want no trouble. W ’en Steam- </p><p>boat an’ his crowd goes up-town, folks </p><p>there most likely’H chase ’em back down </p><p>here to the camp-cars. Then there’ll be </p><p>a mix—an’ all colored folks’ll look alike!” </p><p>“By Jove, Memphis!” ejaculated Andy. </p><p>“I believe you’re not far wrong. First </p><p>thing we know there’ll be a race war on!” </p><p>“Yes, suh, that's jest whut I figger. But </p><p>I’se not said nothin’ yet to nobody but </p><p>you.” </p><p> “Can’t some of you stop Steamboat and</p><p>his bunch?” </p><p> “No, suh, boss, I’se ’fraid not. Ain’t</p><p>no colored man goin’ tackle Steamboat— </p><p>not no time, an* least of all w’en he’s </p><p>drinkin’!” </p><p> The door of Steamboat’s car was flung</p><p>open while Andy stood considering, and a </p><p>broad beam of light shone out. A roaring </p><p>voice—Steamboat’s—reached them. </p><p> “I’se not goin’ ’low nobod}- interfere in my</p><p>bizness! No, suh! If I want go up an’ </p><p>buy me a li’l drink, tha’s my bizness, an’ </p><p>ain’t no w'hite folks goin’ stop me! Can’t </p><p>nobody-” </p><p> The door was slammed shut again, and</p><p>the roaring voice and the howls of approval </p><p>were partially shut off. Andy looked </p><p>around to where Memphis Joe had been </p><p>standing. But Memphis Joe was moving </p><p>away—a deeper shadow' in the shadow's that </p><p>lay along the side of the depot. That </p><p>roaring voice obviously had been too much</p><p>for his nerves. </p><p> “Memphis!” called the agent.</p><p> But Memphis paused not.</p><p> “You do whut you kin, Mistuh Agent,”</p><p>The words floated back from the retreating </p><p>steel ganger pleadingly. “Might be yo’ </p><p>could call on the company foJ help.” </p><p> Memphis Joe faded around the far comer</p><p>of the building and was gone. </p><p> Andy, worried and perplexed, hauled</p><p>the truck out to the front of the station </p><p>and then entered his office. He went to </p><p>the key of the train wire and called Dis- </p><p>patcher Potts, whose office was at Wharton. </p><p> “Some of the steel gang men are threaten-</p><p>ing to make trouble tonight,” he said w’hen </p><p>the dispatcher had answered his call. </p><p>“Could you get some police officers out here </p><p>soon?” </p><p> yes—likely,” replied Potts.</p><p>What seems to be the matter, Andy?” </p><p>“They got some booze and are showing </p><p>signs of going on the w^ar-path. Liable </p><p>15° </p><p>Adventure </p><p>to be a battle on between them and the </p><p>townfolk if things are not stopped.” </p><p> “The devil!" said the dispatcher, plainly</p><p>aroused. “Stick there a few minutes, and </p><p>111 call you.” </p><p> Peck waited impatiently. It was five</p><p>minutes before the dispatcher called. </p><p> “Captain Caney of our police force was</p><p>still in his office,” spelled Potts. “He’s </p><p>gathering up several of his men, and they’ll </p><p>leave here on a special, likely a light engine, </p><p>inside of ten or fifteen minutes. That </p><p>means they should get to Belham inside of </p><p>forty-five minutes.” </p><p> “Good!” said Andy. “They’ll be</p><p>needed.” </p><p> “We got hold of Superintendent Carrick</p><p>and Supervisor Quinn, too. They’ll be on </p><p>the special. No actual trouble yet, is </p><p>there?” </p><p> Peck held the key open a few seconds.</p><p>So Carrick was coming. He wondered </p><p>if the superintendent still considered what </p><p>the steel gang did as none of his—Andy’s— </p><p>affair. He thought of Ina and his spoiled </p><p>wedding-day, and his jaw set grimly. </p><p>When he came, the old man better not say </p><p>much, or he might hear something. </p><p> He tapped the key again.</p><p> “No,” he said to Potts, “but it’s liable</p><p>to break soon, judging by the signs. Tell </p><p>’em to hit the ball.” </p><p> “They sure will. Hold the gang down,</p><p>if you can, till they come and keep me </p><p>posted as much as possible.” </p><p> “I will,” promised Andy. “Good-by—</p><p>here comes 73.” </p><p> He dashed out of the station as the train</p><p>drew in and pulled his truck up to the </p><p>express-car door. Several small boxes of </p><p>express matter were unloaded, and then </p><p>the messenger handed Peck a sealed </p><p>package. </p><p> “Here’s a package the W'harton people</p><p>told me to be sure to get to you tonight,” </p><p>said the man in the express-car. “Sign </p><p>here.” </p><p> Andy signed the messenger’s book, and</p><p>the train departed. lie ran the truck </p><p>around the station, dumped the boxes into </p><p>the wareroom and then reentered the office, </p><p>the sealed package under his arm. It </p><p>was, he knew, the package containing the </p><p>pay-roll sheets and the money with which </p><p>the steel gang was to be paid. </p><p> As Andy entered the office, an unseen</p><p>pair of eager eyes, outside, watched him </p><p>closely through the rear office window. </p><p>The furtive, glistening eyes saw the agent </p><p>place the package on his desk and examine </p><p>it for a moment. But the agent’s next move </p><p>was not so pleasing. Stepping to the front </p><p>of the office, Peck pulled down the shades </p><p>of the two windows there and then moved </p><p>to the one rear window and pulled down </p><p>that shade. </p><p> The silent watcher in the darkness outside</p><p>moved back as Peck approached the last </p><p>window, and he muttered in disappointment </p><p>as the blind was lowered. Fortune, though, </p><p>seemed to favor him, for near the bottom </p><p>there was a small slit in the worn, thread- </p><p>bare shade. Quickly the watcher applied </p><p>an eye opposite the slit. He muttered </p><p>triumphantly; he could see in. </p><p> The shades drawn, Peck approached the</p><p>stationery cupboard that stood against </p><p>the wall at one side of the office, opened </p><p>the doors of it and from a shelf took a </p><p>stack of large envelopes. Next he took </p><p>the sealed package, shoved it to the back </p><p>of the shelf and replaced the envelopes </p><p>where the)' had been. Then he dosed the </p><p>cupboard doors. </p><p> That done, Andy glanced at the office</p><p>clock. It had been 8:05 when he talked to </p><p>the dispatcher. It was 8:20 now; the </p><p>special should be on its way. He went to </p><p>the key and called. </p><p> “Has the special started?” he asked Potts.</p><p> “Just pulled out.51 answered the man</p><p>who ran the trains. “Things all right yet?” </p><p> “Yes, as far as I know,” replied Andy.</p><p>“I’m going up-town now and see how </p><p>affairs are developing. Will try to get back </p><p>here soon and report.” </p><p>\T </p><p> THERE was a perfect buzz of</p><p>excitement around Scanlon's Hotel </p><p>as Andy Peck drew near. The hotel </p><p>stood on the main street between the post- </p><p>office and a general store and was several </p><p>squares from the depot. The barroom was </p><p>a long room at one side of the building. </p><p>On the street corners near-by different </p><p>small groups of Belham citizens stood, </p><p>talking low and seriously and eying the </p><p>window's of the saloon. </p><p> As Peck approadied the side door of the</p><p>barroom, the door was pushed open from </p><p>the outside and a man went in—Steamboat. </p><p>Andy was a little surprized, because he </p><p>Agent Andy </p><p>151 </p><p>had supposed that Steamboat and his </p><p>crowd were already all within; their camp- </p><p>car had been dark and silent when he left </p><p>the station. He stepped to the door him- </p><p>self, pushed it open an inch or so and put </p><p>his eye to the opening. </p><p> Standing lined up along one end of the</p><p>bar were half a dozen of Steamboat’s </p><p>fellow steel gangers. Steamboat was just </p><p>joining them, and they were greeting him </p><p>with noisy sallies. At the other end of the </p><p>bar stood “Big” Noonan, an oil-well driller </p><p>and Bclham’s cock-of-the-walk. Near him </p><p>stood five or six other town men, all of </p><p>them watching the steel gangers and </p><p>muttering to one another, their faces </p><p>frowning, their eyes unfriendly. In back </p><p>of the bar was Scanlon’s barkeeper, plainly </p><p>ill at ease. </p><p> “Give us all li’l drink o’ gin. white man!”</p><p>called Steamboat to the barkeeper. </p><p>The words, as he uttered them, were </p><p>deliberately offensive. There was a slur </p><p>to them, an innuendo on the “white man.” </p><p>The barkeeper hesitated, glancing at the </p><p>frowning faces of Big Noonan and his men. </p><p>Steamboat swaggered closer to the bar. </p><p>“Step ’long, white man!” he said loudly. </p><p>“Whut you ’fraid ’bout?” </p><p> The barkeeper’s face flushed; he took</p><p>up a bottle from the array behind him. </p><p> Andy tarried no longer at the door.</p><p>He let it swing to, went around to the </p><p>front and entered the hotel office. From </p><p>an inner room Proprietor Scanlon himself</p><p>entered the office as Peck stepped in. His </p><p>face was anxious; its ruddy glow was a </p><p>shade paler than usual. </p><p> “Scanlon!” exclaimed Peck. “Just the</p><p>man I want. You must refuse to give </p><p>those colored men out there any more </p><p>booze!” </p><p> He jerked his thumb toward the door that</p><p>led from the office into the barroom. </p><p> Scanlon shook his head.</p><p> “I’d like to, Peck, but I’m more afraid</p><p>to refuse than to give it to them. They’ve </p><p>been acting ugly ever since they came in.” </p><p>“But they'll only get worse if they keep </p><p>on with the stuff!" remonstrated Peck. </p><p>“First thing you know there’ll be a riot </p><p>on! Remember how it started before!” </p><p> “I know!” exclaimed Scanlon. He threw</p><p>up his hands. “But I can’t-” </p><p> A shout interrupted him—a shout that</p><p>came from the barroom. Mingled with it </p><p>was the crash of breaking glass. Then a </p><p>roar arose, deeper shouts, and the sound </p><p>of shattering glass was redoubled. </p><p> “My -!” cried Scanlon. “Listen to</p><p>that!” </p><p> Andy leaped for the barroom door and</p><p>swung it open, Scanlon close behind. </p><p>The barroom was filled with the furious </p><p>clashing of bodies. All lights save a single </p><p>one above the bar were out, smashed to </p><p>bits. Fists thrashed about; vigorous, pro- </p><p>fane phrases were uttered aloud. And then </p><p>in a second something flew through the air; </p><p>there was another crash—and the one </p><p>remaining light vanished. </p><p> “Come on, boys,” called Big Noonan’s</p><p>voice. “Come on, get outside! Everybody </p><p>go get his gun! We’ll go down and clean </p><p>this black camp-car bunch out right!” </p><p> A yell of approval came from what must</p><p>have been the white belligerents. There </p><p>was a rush in the darkened room, and the </p><p>outer side door burst open. The sound </p><p>of swiftly moving feet came to the tense </p><p>Andy and Proprietor Scanlon. Apparently </p><p>the steel gangers had followed the Belham </p><p>citizens out, for the barroom became silent. </p><p>Then, before Peck or Scanlon had moved, </p><p>the barkeeper appeared, his face white. </p><p> “What started it?” demanded Scanlon,</p><p>seizing the man’s shoulder. </p><p> “That nigger—that Steamboat—tried to</p><p>shove Big Noonan aside—and called him </p><p>a name!” stumbled the frightened bar- </p><p>keeper. “Then Noonan landed on him— </p><p>and they all waded in!” </p><p> That was enough for Andy; he waited</p><p>to hear no more. Things, he felt, were </p><p>moving too swiftly for him to control. </p><p>He ran out of the office, down the street, </p><p>popped into a side alley and legged it for </p><p>the depot. He saw men running; cries </p><p>carried to him. Some of the shouts, he </p><p>thought, sounded as if they were coming </p><p>from Steamboat’s crowd-defiant cries. </p><p>He ran his best. </p><p> There was confusion around the camp-</p><p>cars as Peck neared the station—high- </p><p>pitched chatter, figures flitting in and out </p><p>of the doors. Andy avoided the cars and </p><p>came to the depot. Quickly he unlocked </p><p>the waiting-room door, entered and snapped </p><p>the lock again behind him, entered the </p><p>office and closed that door also. </p><p> Upon leaving, he had turned off all the</p><p>inside station lights. Now he did not re- </p><p>light them. He had raised the shades </p><p>before departing, and a platform light just </p><p>152 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>outside shone ihrough the front office </p><p>windows, making enough light for him to </p><p>find his way about in the familiar office. </p><p>He opened the train wire key. </p><p> ‘ She’s broke!” he said to the dispatcher.</p><p>“The fight is on! Started up-town and is </p><p>working this way last, lloyv’s the special </p><p>coming?" </p><p> “She’s getting along,” replied Potts</p><p>quickly. “Ought to show up there inside </p><p>of ten minutes.” </p><p> “If she doesn’t do better than that, she’s</p><p>liable to find nothing but pieces left,” said </p><p>Andy. </p><p> “She’s rolling!” assured the dispatcher.</p><p>“Anybody hurt?” </p><p> “Can’t tell—hope not,” answered Peck.</p><p>He paused as a sudden fusillade of shots </p><p>rang out somewhere up around the camp- </p><p>cars. “They're shooting now!” he said to </p><p>Potts. </p><p> “They are!” flashed the dispatcher.</p><p>“Are you in any danger yourself, boy?” </p><p> “Guess not,” lied Andy, and he smiled</p><p>a little. </p><p> He had heard several things plunk</p><p>against the station right after the volley </p><p>of shots. The marksmen were shooting </p><p>high and wild and hitting the depot. </p><p> “Watch yourself,” began Potts—and</p><p>that was as far as Andy paid any attention </p><p>to what the dispatcher was saying. </p><p> There was a sudden crash at the rear</p><p>window of the office. Glass flew in a </p><p>shower over the office floor.</p><p> “Hoky!” breathed Andy and at once</p><p>dropped to the floor, crouching down in the </p><p>obscurity and protection of the comer at </p><p>the end of the telegraph desk. </p><p> Several lesser crashes followed at the</p><p>window, as if something were being used </p><p>to knock out the ragged pieces of glass left </p><p>sticking there after the first blow. Then </p><p>a black blur abruptly appeared between </p><p>the broken sashes, and a figure dropped </p><p>quickly inside the office. A faint ray of </p><p>light from the platform lamp outside fell </p><p>on the intruder’s face. </p><p> Steamboat Jackson!</p><p>THE agent crouched lower in his </p><p>corner, astonished but silent. </p><p> Without an instant’s delay Steam-</p><p>boat moved to the stationery cupboard. He </p><p>jerked the doors open, reached in and </p><p>pulled out a bunch of big envelopes. He </p><p>reached in again, brought out something </p><p>else and laid it on the ledge of the ticket </p><p>window, dose beside the aiplward. Dark </p><p>as the office was, the agent knew what the </p><p>colored man had placed on the window </p><p>ledge. It was the package of pay-roll </p><p>money! </p><p> A sort of savage ejaculation of pleasure</p><p>came from the steel gang man as he put </p><p>down the package of money. But he did </p><p>not linger over his rejoicing. From the </p><p>cupboard then he quick!) pulled out </p><p>envelopes, tissue sheets and various sizes </p><p>of paper forms. These he pulled apart </p><p>swiftly and piJed on the floor in a heap </p><p>about the corner of the wooden cupboard. </p><p>There was the scratching of a match, and </p><p>a little burst of flame flared up. Steamboat </p><p>reached down and touched the flame to the </p><p>edge of a sheet of paper in the heap that he </p><p>had made. </p><p> Steamboat’s back, as he stood at the</p><p>cupboard, had been turned to Andy Peck. </p><p>The agent's amazement at the colored </p><p>man’s entrance had only been increased </p><p>by his further surprize at Steamboat’s </p><p>bringing forth of the money—by his sur- </p><p>prize that the man should have knowledge </p><p>of it and of its hiding-place. </p><p> And then, as Steamboat piled the paper</p><p>on the floor, some flash of explanation </p><p>came to Andy—some perception of Steam- </p><p>boat’s true reason for inciting the riot. If </p><p>Steamboat had started the trouble pay-day </p><p>night after receiving his wages, the agent </p><p>w-ould not have been so perplexed. Andy </p><p>had wondered, though, why the fellow had </p><p>cut loose tonight, the night before pay-day.</p><p>But now he knewr. </p><p> Up around the camp-cars the shouts</p><p>had risen in volume, but so far there had </p><p>been no repetition of the shooting. As </p><p>Steamboat struck the match and bent </p><p>forward. Andy Peck, silent as a cat, rose </p><p>on the balls of liis feet. As the match </p><p>flame was touched to the paper, he grabbed </p><p>his stout-legged office chair from the floor </p><p>beside him and swmng it in the air. </p><p> “You treacherous devil!” cried Andy and</p><p>brought the chair down on Steamboat's </p><p>head. </p><p> The blow was true, but the colored man’s</p><p>head also w'as true—to type. The steel </p><p>ganger staggered erect as the swif tlv spread- </p><p>ing flame on the floor lit up the office. </p><p>Surprized and slightly bewildered he was, </p><p>but his eyes flashed wickedly as he faced </p><p>the agent. </p><p>Agent Andy </p><p>153 </p><p> “I’ll tear your heart out!” he roared and</p><p>made a lunge at Peck. </p><p> “Try it!” invited Andy, swinging his</p><p>chair again. </p><p> And this time he didn’t aim at the head—</p><p>he aimed a smashing sidewise blow at the </p><p>black man’s shins. Steamboat’s legs were </p><p>swept from under him like straws. He fell </p><p>to the floor with a tremendous thump, his </p><p>howls filling the office. </p><p> “Oh, name o’ God!” he moaned. “Don’</p><p>do that! Don’ do that no mo’, Mistuh </p><p>Agent!” </p><p> Agent Andy, chair poised again, held</p><p>back. </p><p> “Will you be good?” he demanded.</p><p> “Yes, suli! Yes, suh!” groaned Steam-</p><p>boat. “Only jes’ don’ hit my laigs no mo’!” </p><p> There was an abrupt grinding of brakes</p><p>out in front of the office before Andy could </p><p>say mOre and a hissing of steam. Un- </p><p>perceived, the special had arrived—a light </p><p>engine. The waiting-room door flew open </p><p>with a crash as stout shoulders were set </p><p>against the lock’s resistance. There was </p><p>a tramping of heavy feet inside. Andy </p><p>flung open the office door. Carrick, Quinn, </p><p>Capt. Caney and three other men swept in, </p><p>flashlights and pistols in hand. </p><p> “Peck!” cried the superintendent, amazed</p><p>at the sight in the office. “What in the </p><p>devil! What’s this fire? We saw it through </p><p>the window!” </p><p> But Peck was all business; he had a plan</p><p>in mind. </p><p> “Watch that man on the floor!” he ex-</p><p>claimed. “Grab him up and make him </p><p>walk!” And without further ado he </p><p>snatched up the office water bucket and </p><p>dashed its contents on the burning heap </p><p>of paper. The fire by that time had been </p><p>licking eagerly at the stationery case. </p><p>But the water was sufficient; the flames </p><p>abruptly expired. </p><p> “Come along! WTe got to hurry!” cried</p><p>Andy then. He grabbed up the package </p><p>of pay-roll money from the ticket window </p><p>ledge and thrust it into Quinn’s hands. </p><p>“Hang on to that!” he said. </p><p> Capt. Caney meanwhile had hauled the</p><p>abject Steamboat to his feet. Peck clutched </p><p>the colored man’s other arm. Pushing and </p><p>tugging, he started for the door. </p><p> Amazed and not comprehending, they</p><p>seemed all to recognize .Andy’s leadership. </p><p>In a group they burst out of the station </p><p>and headed toward the near-by camp-cars, </p><p>Caney and Peck in the lead, dragging the </p><p>reluctant steel ganger between them. </p><p> “W'hat’s the idea?” grunted Caney as</p><p>they stumbled on. “What’re you work- </p><p>ing at?” </p><p> “Wait!” panted Andy. &lt;fNot time now</p><p>to explain. Have to get this thing headed </p><p>off before some one gets killed—if some one </p><p>hasn’t already been. You just follow my </p><p>lead and back me up!” </p><p> The moon had come up since Andy’s</p><p>hasty return to the office from up-town, </p><p>revealing the camp-cars and surroundings </p><p>clearly as the party approached. All lights </p><p>in the cars were now out, the cars5 occupants </p><p>lurking in the obscurity inside. </p><p> As the party rounded the end of the</p><p>string of cars, the Belham citizens, gathered </p><p>in the shadow of a warehouse at the head </p><p>of the siding, apparently mistook them </p><p>for charging steel gangers. A shout arose. </p><p> “Here they come, boys!” It was Big</p><p>Noonan’s voice. “Out and at them!” </p><p>There was a mighty shout in answer, </p><p>and the Belliamites leaped out for battle. </p><p>From Steamboat’s darkened car an answer- </p><p>ing cry went forth, and some shots flashed </p><p>out. Andy Peck dropped Steamboat’s </p><p>arm and jumped ahead of his party. </p><p> “Keep back, men!” he shouted to the</p><p>oncoming townfolk. “Keep 'em back, </p><p>Noonan! Everything's all right now!” </p><p>The Belhamites, recognizing Peck’s voice </p><p>and perceiving their mistake as to the </p><p>party’s identity, faltered and came to a halt. </p><p>Only Noonan pressed forward. </p><p> “What!” he cried. “That you, Andy?”</p><p>“Yes,” replied the agent. “Just hold </p><p>your men a minute! I’m going to fix </p><p>things.” </p><p> He turned and grasped Steamboat by</p><p>the arm. </p><p> “Tell your men in that car to let up!”</p><p>he commanded sternly. “Tell them to </p><p>come out here, quick!” </p><p> Steamboat, overawed, did not demur.</p><p>He faced liis car. </p><p> “Come on out, Geo’ge!” he called de-</p><p>jectedly. “Come on, you an’ all the boys!” </p><p>“Fo’ the lan’ sakes, that you, Steam- </p><p>boat?” said one in the car, evidently </p><p>Geo’ge; his head was cautiously sticking </p><p>out an open window. “We-aU been won- </p><p>d’ring wliar you been!” </p><p> “It’s me,” admitted the gloomy Steam-</p><p>boat. </p><p> “You’ll not be harmed,” put in Peck</p><p>154 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>to the men in the car. “And, when you </p><p>get out here, I'll tell you where Steamboat’s </p><p>been.”	*</p><p> From the car next to Steamboat’s a</p><p>voice now spoke—Memphis Joe’s voice, </p><p>coming from the doorway. </p><p> “Am that you, Mistuh Agent?”</p><p> “It is,” answered Andy. “Get the boys</p><p>all out, Memphis, and bring ’em here. </p><p>Nobody’ll get hurt.” </p><p> A joyous whoop came from Memphis,</p><p>and in a second he and the other men in </p><p>his car tumbled out, arriving on the ground </p><p>as soon as Steamboat’s crowd. From other </p><p>cars steel gangers did likewise, whooping </p><p>as the word spread. They gathered to- </p><p>gether near where Andy, Carrick, Quinn, </p><p>Steamboat, Caney and the other officers </p><p>stood. Quietly now, perceiving that some </p><p>strange thing was happening, the Belham </p><p>men and Big Noonan edged nearer, lining </p><p>up on one side of the agent and his party, </p><p>while the colored men lined up on the </p><p>other. </p><p>“YOU men have been easy marks— </p><p>suckers!” said Andy, addressing </p><p>himself particularly to Steamboat’s </p><p>wondering, rather sheepish-looking half </p><p>dozen. “Steamboat’s been making you </p><p>play tricks for him—tricks so he’d get the </p><p>good things and you’d get nothing. Did </p><p>you know that, George?” </p><p> “Whut you-all mean?” nervously said</p><p>George, a tall, rangy buck. </p><p> “Why, you know how Steamboat’s been</p><p>blowing he was going South this Winter</p><p>with a pocketful of money. But he hadn’t </p><p>got his pocketful. Today, though, he must </p><p>have learned some way that I was expecting </p><p>a package of cash on this evening’s train. </p><p>He decided that was just the cash he </p><p>wanted. </p><p> “So he got some booze, managed to get</p><p>you fellows worked up and finally got a </p><p>good-looking riot started. Then, while </p><p>you men did the fighting, he sneaked down </p><p>to the station, broke in, found the money </p><p>and tried to set the station on fire. The </p><p>fire would be blamed on the riot, see— </p><p>and his theft of the money would be </p><p>covered up. But I happened to be in the </p><p>station, and Steamboat came to grief!” </p><p> A stir—as of resentment—was visible</p><p>among the half-dozen. </p><p> “Fo’ Lawd’s sake, Steamboat!” said</p><p>George. “Am that right?” </p><p> But Sleamboat made no answer. He</p><p>merely hung his head and mumbled un- </p><p>intelligibly. </p><p> “Sure, it's right!” declared Andy. “Look</p><p>at him. and you can tell for vourselves. </p><p>And, of course, you don’t know what the </p><p>money Steamboat tried to swipe was for, </p><p>do you, George?” </p><p> “No, suh,” answered George.</p><p> “Well, I’ll tell you. It’s pay money</p><p>that’s to be us-ed to pay the steel gang men </p><p>tomorrow. That’s the kind of man Steam- </p><p>boal is. He was going to take it all, and </p><p>you fellows wouldn’t have got any—not </p><p>tomorrow, anyway. You’d have had to </p><p>wait several days longer until another pay- </p><p>roll was fixed up.” </p><p> This time the wave of resentment that</p><p>swept over the steel gang was not confined </p><p>to the men from Steamboat’s car; it went </p><p>over the entire crowd, and there was a </p><p>muttering of imprecations and threats. </p><p>Seeing their bad-man subdued, the rest </p><p>of the gang felt emboldened. </p><p> But Andy had turned away from them</p><p>for a moment. He faced Big Noonan and </p><p>the Belham men. </p><p> “You see how it is, Noonan.” he said.</p><p>“This Steamboat man here is really the </p><p>only one to blame—and we’ll get rid of him. </p><p>He prodded on a few others, for the reasons </p><p>I just gave. But most of these colored </p><p>men didn’t want any trouble. One of </p><p>them came to me just before train-time </p><p>tonight, told me he was afraid Steamboat </p><p>was trying to stir up something and asked </p><p>me to do what I could to stop it.” </p><p> “I’d say you did what you could!”</p><p>boomed Big Noonan. “You certainly </p><p>stopped it!” </p><p> “Hurrah for Andy!” called several of the</p><p>Belham citizens behind Noonan. </p><p> And three cheers were given; exuberandy.</p><p>And then, to the embarrassed agent’s </p><p>confusion, they were echoed by the steel </p><p>gang side. But Agent Andy kept his wits. </p><p>He faced the colored men again. </p><p> “And, now that the fuss is over and you’re</p><p>going to get your money tomorrow, the </p><p>railroad wants all you men to stay!” he </p><p>cried. “All but Steamboat. It’s he that’s </p><p>been making all the trouble—filling you </p><p>full of lies about the cold weather and </p><p>trying to scare you out—just" out of pure </p><p>devilishness. You stick with the railroad, </p><p>and they’ll see that you’re kept warm— </p><p>get lots of coal and plenty to eat. Here re </p><p>Agent Andy- </p><p>155 </p><p>the big bosses—the superintendent and the </p><p>supervisor. They’ll tell you the same!” </p><p> Andy turned to the big bosses.</p><p> “How about it, gentlemen?” he said.</p><p> He looked at Quinn, and then he looked</p><p> at Carrick. When he looked at Carrick,</p><p> Andy’s eyes were a little defiant.</p><p> But the superintendent was not slow to</p><p> respond.</p><p>“That’s right!” he affirmed loudly. </p><p>“What the agent said goes. We’ll take </p><p>care of you! It’s a promise! W7ill you </p><p> stay?”</p><p> There was a half instant’s hesitation.</p><p> Then Memphis Joe spoke.</p><p>“Yes, suh!” he shouted. “I’se goin’ </p><p>stay! We-all goin’ stay! WTiat you-all say, </p><p>big boys?” </p><p> He turned to his fellows. And a great</p><p> shout of affirmation greeted him.</p><p>“Goin’ stay!” roared the steel gang. </p><p>“Goin’ stay!”' </p><p> “That’s the stuff!” called Carrick en-</p><p> thusiastically. “We’D count on you, every</p><p> one!”</p><p>He faced about to where Andy Peck </p><p>stood. And then—-for the first time in his </p><p>1 ife so far as any man there knew—he openly </p><p>confessed to an error. </p><p> “Son,” said Carrick quietly, “I’ve made</p><p> a mistake. I’m just beginning to get an</p><p> idea of what you’ve done here for us. And,</p><p> if I’m not too late, I want to ask you to</p><p> forget what I said the other day—forget it</p><p> and stay here on this job. Will you do it?”</p><p> Andy could scarcely believe his ears.</p><p> Somehow the possibility of anything like</p><p>this had never occurred to him. For a </p><p>moment the thought swept through his </p><p>head that here was a most excellent oppor- </p><p>tunity to say something that would scorch </p><p>Carrick’s hide. But consideration of Ina </p><p>and knowledge of what his staying would </p><p>mean to her and to him checked his tongue </p><p>—if not a certain sense of whimsicality that </p><p>always was lurking at the back of his brain. </p><p> “I'll be so pleased!” he murmured.</p><p>IT WAS somewhat less than ten </p><p>minutes after he had given the su- </p><p>perintendent his answer that Andy </p><p>came to the residence of Duncan, the miller. </p><p>He was about to press the bell when the </p><p>door flew open and Ina came out, appar- </p><p>ently bound for somewhere in great haste. </p><p>She stopped abruptly at sight of him. </p><p> “Andy!” she exclaimed. “I’ve been so</p><p>worried and afraid—all that noise and </p><p>shooting! I was just going out to hunt </p><p>you!” </p><p> “You needn't now,” he said, his face</p><p>beaming. “I’m here.” </p><p>_ “Is—is everything all right?” she ques- </p><p>tioned, seemingly a little puzzled at his very </p><p>obvious joy. </p><p> “All right? Well, I guess yes!” He</p><p>seized her in his arms. “We’re going to </p><p>have our little bungalow after all, little girl!’' </p><p> “Andy!”</p><p> “Yes, indeedy!” he cried. “Old man</p><p>Carrick is going to keep me on the job, </p><p>and-” </p><p> But that was as far as he got just then—</p><p>for reasons that may be surmised. </p><p>The Tree of Life </p><p> A Complete 7Voveleti</p><p>/ </p><p>&amp; </p><p> ray</p><p>C7JARLES </p><p>tt&amp;TXLE </p><p>Author of "The Winged Avenger,” “Witch-Doctorsdr. </p><p> /I VEIN of platinum on a jade</p><p> ^% ring was the river Mfunyaballa</p><p>flowing through the forests of </p><p>A. m. the French Congo.

A yodeling cry from the steamy</p><p>cavern of the. forest caused the village to </p><p>swarm with lithe ebon figures whose heads </p><p>were decorated with frizzly hair, built a </p><p>foot high above the forehead, streaming with </p><p>long-bladed spears in their hands, like a </p><p>flood of ants, to a point upon the riverside. </p><p>Again came the cry from the forest from </p><p>down the river. The distant throb grew </p><p>into the “Eh! Ahh! Eh! Ahh! Eh! Ahh!” </p><p>of the chant of paddlers. Presently around </p><p>a bend appeared a canoe. As the host of </p><p>natives squatted in silence, came stalking </p><p>solemnly a tall figure with an ivory comb </p><p>like a dagger stuck through the head-dress </p><p>of hair and carrying an Express rifle. In </p><p>the midst of his people he sank upon liis </p><p>haunches, gazing from a masklike face </p><p>down the river with Lhe eyes of a repressed </p><p>child. The strange canoe hugged the far </p><p>bank of the river, indicating by neglect of </p><p>the rowers to avoid the sweep of the stream </p><p>that they were uncertain of their reception. </p><p> Amidship of the leading canoe was a hood</p><p>of woven grass from which protruded the </p><p>helmet of a white man. When the canoe </p><p>was immediately opposite the village, the </p><p>paddlers backed water, and a tall man </p><p>garbed in w’hite calico with a green turban </p><p>after the Arab manner stood up in the bow </p><p>and chanted rapidly in a loud voice. The </p><p>mob of natives watching gravely on the </p><p>beach listened in silence. When the stran- </p><p>ger had ceased, one cried back and was again </p><p>answered by a chant and a signal made with </p><p>the right hand raised. </p><p> Immediately the tall chief with the Ex-</p><p>press rifle rose to his feet, cried out imperi- </p><p>ously and sat down. The canoe continued </p><p>up-stream for fifty yards, swung round, </p><p>came diagonally across the current and </p><p>nosed its way through a flotilla of small </p><p>and large canoes upon the village strand. </p><p> From the canoe sprang a short slender</p><p>man clad in weather-worn khaki and wear- </p><p>ing a small dark beard. The chief rose to </p><p>his feet as the white approached and raised </p><p>one hand, murmuring the Arabic word- </p><p> “SdUwmaV*</p><p> “SalaarnaJ” responded the white. ‘</p><p> As he raised his hand in the salute, his</p><p>quick dark eyes were upon the Express </p><p>rifle. </p><p> Solemnly the chief turned and led the</p><p>way through the mob of his people up the </p><p>hill to an open dusty space littered with </p><p>goats, chickens and calabashes, where </p><p>stood a thatched roof upon half a dozen </p><p>poles, the palaver-house. Opposite to each</p><p>other upon carved wooden stools, with the </p><p>white man's interpreter in the green turban </p><p>beside him. they began the formal palaver. </p><p> After more greetings and the solemn</p><p>sniffing by the white man of the snuff </p><p>proffered in a tiny gourd, the young chief </p><p>156 </p><p>The Tree of Life </p><p>157 </p><p>indifferently accepted presents of several </p><p>bales of cloth and a Snider rifle with cart- </p><p>ridges. During the interview the white </p><p>man’s sharp eyes were unobtrusively </p><p>noting details. The interpreter informed </p><p>him that the chief had graciously permitted </p><p>the strange white man to camp in the open </p><p>space of the village. </p><p> The white recalled the topographical sur-</p><p>roundings, and after swift reflection he con- </p><p>sented, knowing that, except for field clear- </p><p>ings in the dense forest, there probably was </p><p>no other ground suitable for a camp. These </p><p>matters having been arranged, the chief </p><p>intimated that he would present the cre- </p><p>dentials to his august father, Basayaguru, </p><p>which entailed the presentation of another </p><p>Snider rifle. As the young chief rose to </p><p>depart, the white man eyed the Express as </p><p>the warrior handed it to his superior. </p><p> &lt;fNotice that .450, Ali?” he commented</p><p>to the interpreter as they continued to sit </p><p>in the shade while their equipment was </p><p>brought from the canoes. “D’you think </p><p>there are any white traders round here?” </p><p>“Allah is all-wise,” responded Ali Mo- </p><p>hammed. “Perhaps the person has traded </p><p>it from the South, sir.” </p><p> “South!” exclaimed the little doctor</p><p>briskly. “These people are not nomadic, </p><p>are they? I’ve understood from the agent </p><p>at Kavaballa's that no whites have yet </p><p>been here; district only touched by oc- </p><p>casional countrymen of yours. Isn’t that </p><p>right?” </p><p> “Allah is all-wise.” repeated Ali mono-</p><p>tonously, blinking both eyelids. “But my </p><p>countrymen are not disposed to carry </p><p>weapons of that kind, Doctor.” </p><p> “Urn, Um,” muttered the little doctor.</p><p>“Hi/” he shouted in broken Kiswahili, </p><p>pointing his cane. “Make those men </p><p>clear up this ground before you pitch the </p><p>tent. Fahamshi ? Tell ’em, Ali. This </p><p>ground is nothing but a bug-preserve.” </p><p>He took out a cigar and lighted it. “What’s </p><p>the particular pet superstition here, Ali? </p><p>Same as below or a new pope or something, </p><p> “Allah is-”</p><p> “1 asked you what you think?” snapped</p><p>the doctor. </p><p> “I do not think, sir,” returned Ali</p><p>imperturbably. “The savage think many </p><p>things that they dream.” </p><p> “Dream! Dream!” He glanced at Ali</p><p>and grinned like a friendly terrier through </p><p>his short beard. “Um. You’re right. All </p><p>this ju-ju business is merely the projection </p><p>of a dream.” </p><p> “In my country that is what our wise men</p><p>say.” </p><p> “Do they, begad? Then they’re a-</p><p>sight wiser than ours! Um. Um. Ali, </p><p>do you know what particular legend they </p><p>have here?” </p><p> “No, Doctor,” admitted Ali. “I do not.</p><p>There are many strange and mystical </p><p>things in Africa.” </p><p> “Mystical tommyrot!” snorted Dr. Herd-</p><p>wether. “I don’t believe you know much </p><p>about it all.” </p><p> “Only Allah knows the truth.”</p><p> “I didn’t bring you here to know Allah’s</p><p>opinion upon every- thing from yams </p><p>to folklore. As soon as you possibly can, </p><p>get them to talk.” </p><p> “They will not tell us,” said Ali, “for</p><p>these peoples always seek to hide their </p><p>cult from the infidel eyes of strangers.” </p><p>“Um. Um. Well, try, confound it, try!” </p><p>The energetic little man jumped to his </p><p>feet, inspected the tent, sniffed disgustedly </p><p>and walked with short nervous steps to </p><p>the outskirts of the village with the object </p><p>of seeking another site free from native </p><p>garbage and the ubiquitous flea. But there </p><p>seemed no hope, for the up-river side was </p><p>as unpromising as he had observed the down </p><p>side to be. </p><p> The river swirled around the small</p><p>peninsula and away on its main course, </p><p>leaving a series of flat swamps and tiny </p><p>creeks, crocodile invested, worming into the </p><p>dense forests in all directions; from the </p><p>land side of the village was a vista of regi- </p><p>ments of tree-stumps in native fields </p><p>hewn out of the primeval forest, fields in </p><p>which women—many with babies wrapped </p><p>in skins upon their arched backs—worked </p><p>diligently with the small native hoe pre- </p><p>paring the ground for the annual sowing. </p><p>Away high over the sullen edge of the forest </p><p>soared lazily a pallid halfmoon. </p><p>fw! BACK through the village, noting </p><p>gjiujg the square hut of Arab influence </p><p>surrounded by a small palisade with </p><p>a large wild fig in the center, the little doctor</p><p>tramped, batting at the myriad flies. As, </p><p>perspiring and hot , he plunged into his green </p><p>canvas chair, his personal boy emerged with </p><p>whisky and a sparklet siphon. Each ges- </p><p>ture of making, drinking, striking a match, </p><p>158 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>lighting a cigar and the tones of the voice </p><p>irritably demanding the preparation of his </p><p>rubber-bath was observed solemnly by the </p><p>circle of boys and warriors tickling their </p><p>curiosity while their wives, mothers and </p><p>sisters toiled in the blazing sun in the fields. </p><p> As the purple shadows elongated, came a</p><p>procession from the hill, led by the tall </p><p>chief, Basafingu. Advancing to within </p><p>three feet of the white man, he squatted </p><p>down. His followers placed before him </p><p>two elephant tusks of great weight and good </p><p>condition. According to the etiquette of </p><p>a great chief the little doctor pretended </p><p>not to notice their presence. For some </p><p>minutes he continued to smoke his cigar, </p><p>interested in the swelling of the sun as it </p><p>sank within the humid atmosphere above </p><p>the trees. </p><p> As silently and abstractedly sat Basa-</p><p>fingu and his ebon retainers. From another </p><p>green tent, the replica of the doctor’s, </p><p>emerged Ali in the green turban and a </p><p>green gown and, stalking with much dignity, </p><p>sank upon a stool beside the doctor without </p><p>as much as a twitch of the eyelid to ac- </p><p>knowledge the presence of the young </p><p>chief. In impressed silence the audience </p><p>of warriors and boys and children watched </p><p>the statuesque poses of the actors. At last </p><p>Ali gravely permitted his eyes to rest upon </p><p>Basafingu and, turning very slowly, ob- </p><p>served quietly: </p><p> “There appears to be some of the savages</p><p>bearing presents for you, Doctor. Probably </p><p>it would be as well to observe them now. ” </p><p> ‘‘Probably it would,” assented the doc-</p><p>tor. “This sort of thing gets on my nerves. </p><p>You bargain and begin the debate, Ali.” </p><p> “Permit your eyes to see them, and I will</p><p>speak.” </p><p> The doctor accordingly turned his head</p><p>and regarded the gathering with a bored </p><p>stare. After some five minutes of formal </p><p>greetings Ali observed: </p><p> “The chief, Basayaguru, the father of</p><p>this person, sends you these unworthy and </p><p>trifling presents. Nod your head with the </p><p>utmost carelessness, Doctor. Perfectly ad- </p><p>mirable, sir. He intimates that he will be </p><p>pleased to receive you in audience upon the</p><p>morrow before the sun is yet high. Nod </p><p>again if you please, and I will dismiss these </p><p>savages.” </p><p> Ali made the set reply, whereupon the</p><p>young chief, apparently impressed, re- </p><p>sponded and rose. But, when the bearers of </p><p>the tusks had departed in his wake, there </p><p>remained an old man whose head-dress was </p><p>not so high as those of the young men and </p><p>was like a bunch of greasy white wool. </p><p>The face was wizened and as finely net- </p><p>worked with lines as knitted black silk; </p><p>on each side of the tufts of white wool </p><p>which was his beard swung lumps of quartz </p><p>as big as a walnut, suspended from the </p><p>distended lobes; skeleton arms and limbs </p><p>protruded from his robes of wildcat skins. </p><p>He bent liis bead after the manner of an </p><p>Arabic salaam until he revealed the scraggy </p><p>wrinkles on the back of his neck; then he </p><p>spoke, mumbling toothlessly- </p><p> “This exquisitely wrinkled person,” ob-</p><p>served Ali, “intimates that he is a doctor, </p><p>sir.” </p><p> “Not of divinity, I trust?” queried the</p><p>little man with a twitching lip. </p><p> “It is injudicious to exhibit levity in the</p><p>presence of the ignorant,” admonished Ali </p><p>gravely. </p><p> “Perfectly correct, Ali, perfectly correct.</p><p>But what may the creature want?'7 </p><p> “He is, I deduce, the tribal medicine-</p><p>man.” </p><p> “Oh. A brother witch-doctor, begad!</p><p>Um. Er—just the beggar we ought to </p><p>make friends with, eh, Ali? What does </p><p>he want?” </p><p> “As ever in this world among the infidel,</p><p>he wishes undoubtedly a present of worldly </p><p>goods of some denomination.” </p><p> “Talk, man, for heaven’s sake, talk,”</p><p>snapped the little doctor, “or I shall have </p><p>to go into the tent to laugh. Ask him what </p><p>the current ju-ju is.” </p><p> “The moment is most inopportune.”</p><p>retorted Ali woodenlv. “With your per- </p><p>mission I will instruct Yamagulu to present </p><p>him with two knives and a small bale of </p><p>cloLh and your most august respects.” </p><p> “All right, but add a Snider to the re-</p><p>spects. And find out how much we can </p><p>buy him for?” </p><p> “The time is most injudic-”</p><p> “Never mind; try him.”</p><p> “As you wish, Doctor."</p><p> After commanding the head man. Yama-</p><p>gulu, to bring the presents specified, Ali </p><p>engaged the witch-doctor in polite conver-</p><p>sation regarding the exalted status of the </p><p>white chief, all that appertained to him </p><p>and the imaginary objects of the expedi- </p><p>tion. The rifle and goods were brought </p><p>and placed at the feet of the old man, who </p><p>The Tree of Life </p><p>T59 </p><p>apparently remained unaware of them. </p><p>At length Yamala, the witch-doctor, made </p><p>his adieux and rose, leaving the presents </p><p>upon the ground to be collected by his people. </p><p> “Well, what did he say?” demanded the</p><p>doctor. </p><p> “In this case, Doctor, I have considered</p><p>it inexpedient to obey you.’' </p><p> “-you!”</p><p> “I wish to remind Lhe doctor that I have</p><p>lived and traded among such savages as </p><p>these for a period of fifteen years; therefore </p><p>it is Lo be presumed lhal I may possibly </p><p>be permitted Lo be belter acquainted with </p><p>them and their minds lhan the doclor.” </p><p>“Possibly, .Ali, but—well, this confounded </p><p>beating about lhe bush irritates me.” </p><p> “The doctor will permit me to remark</p><p>that, if he persists in applying the Occi- </p><p>dental attitude Lo Lhe Oriental mind, the </p><p>chance of gaining the desired information, </p><p>economical and social, will be considerably </p><p>diminished thereby.” </p><p> “You’re a dear!” exclaimed the little</p><p>doctor, showing his teeth in a grin. “But </p><p>—all right, Ali, go your own way, but for_ </p><p>heaven’s sake don’t mull it.” </p><p> “As Allah wills!” observed Ali and turned</p><p>his bronze Arab-Somali features toward the </p><p>two tusks, appraising ihem with bright </p><p>expert eyes. “Have you remarked, Doctor, </p><p>the exceptional generosity of the chief? </p><p>These tusks are considerably over one </p><p>hundred pounds each and therefore, at the </p><p>present market-price, of value considerably </p><p>over one hundred guineas. Never have I </p><p>known any of these savage chiefs to recom- </p><p>pense a stranger so disproporlionately to </p><p>the value of the present bestowed. Never, </p><p>Doctor.” </p><p> “All right, Ali; so much the better for</p><p>you. Keep ’em, my boy; only don’t forget </p><p>to pump my ancient medical colleague.” </p><p> “A thousand thanks to you, Doctor,”</p><p>said Ali, salaaming. “I will assuredly en- </p><p>deavor to recompense you to the best </p><p>ability.” </p><p> “Oh, shut up, Ali. I like you, but you’re</p><p>a bore sometimes. Hi, Yamagulu, whisky </p><p>soda. Upesil” </p><p>U</p><p>VIOLET twilight stained with green </p><p>died hurriedly, leaving the dented </p><p>moon as if battered with the bore- </p><p>dom of the chiliads to gaze incuriouslv </p><p>upon microcosmical contorlions. From the </p><p>village of Basayaguru rose continuously, </p><p>like puffs of invisible steam from an engine- </p><p>exhaust, the rhythm of a drum above the </p><p>murmur of the forest and the swirl of the </p><p>river in the sulky air. </p><p> Like the red eye of a familiar, winking in</p><p>masonic import to old Yamala, the witch- </p><p>doctor, squalling like an idol carved in </p><p>ebony, was the glow of the little doctors </p><p>cigar as he sat in the doorway of his tenl </p><p>in Lhe lee of the greenwrood fire. Half in </p><p>shadow beside him was Ali, his robes a </p><p>volume of carven Lurquoise supporting the </p><p>dignity of his turbaned head, a cameo in </p><p>lazulite. </p><p> “Now, Ali,” said the doctor, “it’s really</p><p>about time you got to business. W'e’ve had </p><p>a week of this fooling. We’ve got a general </p><p>idea of the supply of ivory and that your </p><p>confounded people ruined the vine rubber </p><p>ages ago. But wre could have got that </p><p>almost anywhere. Now try to find out </p><p>exactly w'hat is the basis of their cult— </p><p>whether it is the same in this part as down- </p><p>country. Understand?” </p><p> “It most usually is so, Doctor,” responded</p><p>Ali. </p><p> “Well, but you don’t know. I want</p><p>facts, not suppositions.” </p><p> “I still venture to doubt whether the</p><p>moment be expedient yet,” objected Ali </p><p>tonelessly. </p><p> “Do as I tell you, confound you!”</p><p> “The Occidental and the Oriental-”</p><p> “Shut up!”</p><p> “Very good, Doctor. But you will</p><p>please note that I do not take the responsi- </p><p>bility. I obey.” </p><p> As tonelessly as an oracle Ali spoke</p><p>fluently to the old man Yamala, who at </p><p>length replied as monotonously. </p><p> “The witch-doctor states that they have</p><p>a goddess who dwells in the woods.” </p><p>“Well?” </p><p> “Please to contain your most natural</p><p>emotions,” reproved Ali. “It is not the </p><p>custom of the Orient-” </p><p> “Oh,-the Orient!”</p><p> “Please to be patient.” remonstrated .Ali</p><p>and began anew' to talk with the witch-doc- </p><p>tor. </p><p> The old man rumbled on in periods, punc-</p><p>tuated by assenting grunts from Ali. The</p><p>doctor finished his cigar and lighted an- </p><p>other. Yet slill lhe Lwo voices blended as </p><p>if in a liturgy to the rhythmic throb of the </p><p>single drum and the faint anthem of the </p><p>i6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>mosquitoes. The old man ceased and re- </p><p>lapsed i#to immobility. </p><p> “Well, well? What is it?*’</p><p> Ali was undoubtedly in a state of excite-</p><p>ment indicated by a slight half-tone raise </p><p>in the timbre of his voice. </p><p> “These peoples have, as you know,</p><p>Doctor, been much influenced by the in- </p><p>cursions of my own people. They were at </p><p>one remote period the storehouse of our </p><p>slaves, although in these days of your </p><p>exquisite civilization one is compelled to </p><p>take tribute in the form of merchandise </p><p>only. I desire to point out that our ancient </p><p>truths have influenced even these savages.” </p><p>“You have,” interrupted the doctor </p><p>dryly. “Get on.” </p><p> “The Occidental are not the ways of the</p><p>Oriental-” </p><p> “Ah, shut up and get along with the</p><p>yam!” </p><p> “I hasten to obey, Doctor. I desire to</p><p>state that these savages have confused an </p><p>ancient philosophy with their own ig- </p><p>norant superstitions.” </p><p> “Never mind that. What is the super-</p><p>stition?” </p><p> “As you will doubtless have read or</p><p>learned, Doctor, each of these peoples have, </p><p>with scarcely any exception, a belief in the </p><p>spirits of the trees and the rivers. The </p><p>correct word flees from me.” </p><p> “Animism.”</p><p> “Thank you. Doctor. Animism. But</p><p>in this case they have confused-” </p><p> “Confound it,” grumbled Herdw-ether,</p><p>“never mind that!” </p><p> “They, as I wish to express, believe in</p><p>the spirits of the wood and the plants. </p><p>They have, tlft? priest tells me, here a </p><p>sacred and holy tree, which is the mother— </p><p>I desire to express that it is the mother.” </p><p>“Well, you have. What about it?” </p><p>“Because all other trees are male.” </p><p> “The devil they are! Trees have sex as</p><p>well as anybody else.” </p><p> “Indeed true words as your exquisite</p><p>education has taught me. But not with </p><p>these peoples. It is that I wish to express </p><p>that they have confused their superstition </p><p>with the truths of my peoples, the Berbers. </p><p>As may and yet may not be known to you,</p><p>Doctor, the Berbers of the Atlas before the </p><p>coming of the true believers-” </p><p> “Meaning your crowd, eh?”</p><p> “Indeed surely, Doctor. The Berbers, I</p><p>may state, had faith in the mother of the </p><p>universe, the sun, w'hich is, they said with </p><p>admirable logic, the source of heat and there- </p><p>fore of all things and therefore was fecund </p><p>and therefore was a female, the mother of </p><p>all.” </p><p> “What the devil’s that got to do with</p><p>this ju-ju idol?” </p><p>“THERE is no idol, Doctor. It </p><p>is a tree.” </p><p>“What?” </p><p> “Truly indeed what, Doctor. The priest</p><p>here informs that upon the mother tree </p><p>depends quite, and undoubtedly logically </p><p>fr6m their point of view, the crops and all </p><p>that is grown and therefore their alimen- </p><p>tation.” </p><p> “Yes, yes, the old idea from Jack in the</p><p>Green to the Flarnen Dialis. W'ell?” </p><p> “And therefore, with exquisite logic, that</p><p>it is necessary for the tree to be fertilized </p><p>and therefore to be married. At the </p><p>first moon of the sowing, wrhich is close unto </p><p>us nowr, is the ceremony of the marriage of </p><p>the magic tree.” </p><p> “Married? To whom?”</p><p> “To whom the sacred tree is married I</p><p>can not say. Such is without doubt as in </p><p>all religions a matter forbidden to infldels </p><p>and the ignorant.” </p><p> “Well, buy the information then.”</p><p> “It is not possible to buy faith. With</p><p>one thousand pardons I will express myself </p><p>for the reason of my excitement/' replied </p><p>Ali as coldly as the liturgy. “According </p><p>to my wav* of thinking, the priest is most </p><p>friendly disposed toward us. Indeed, he </p><p>has invited—even more in the limits of his </p><p>language—he has prayed that we stop to </p><p>see the ceremony of the marriage of the </p><p>sacred tree.” </p><p> “Um. Urn.” mumbled the doctor,</p><p>scratching a mosquito-bite on his left ear. </p><p>“But do they usually invite strangers to </p><p>witness these sacred rites?” </p><p> “Undoubtedly not. Undoubtedly not.</p><p>Doctor. That is also one reason for the </p><p>state of excitement in which you see me.” </p><p>“Um. Um.” The red eye of the doctor’s </p><p>familiar glared ferociously at the carven </p><p>image in ebony by the dull embers. The </p><p>throb of the drum pulsed steadily. “It </p><p>appears to me that there must be a reason </p><p>behind the invitation. What can it be? Is</p><p>it money? I mean more presents? Yet </p><p>they’ve been most unusually lavish already, </p><p>haven't they?” </p><p>The Tree of Life </p><p>161 </p><p> “More than exquisitely lavish,” asserted</p><p>Ali. “The reason is known to Allah.’5 </p><p>“Confound Allah!” </p><p> “The doctor is unconsciously blasphe-</p><p>mous,” reproved Ali. </p><p> “No; it’s a gift, I assure you,” grinned the</p><p>doctor. “Um. Um. Well, about the cere- </p><p>mony business. What else did he say?” </p><p>“Is it not sufficiently astonishing that he </p><p>should tell us these things? The doctor </p><p>does not perceive the exquisite abyss be- </p><p>tween the Occidental and the Oriental.” </p><p>“Exquisite twaddle. Is there a sacrifice? </p><p>These devils invariably want lakes of blood </p><p>to bathe their gods in.” </p><p> “That is unknown to me, Doctor.”</p><p> “Well, ask him, confound it!”</p><p> “His lips will be tighter than the shell</p><p>upon the ocean shore, but, if it amuses the </p><p>doctor, I will hasten to obey.” </p><p> Again there followed the solemn litur-</p><p>gical conversation. The doctor moved rest- </p><p>lessly as if the continuous beat of the drum </p><p>sought his pulse. </p><p> “The doctor will observe that my words</p><p>are as true as the Koran. The tongue of the </p><p>black priest is swollen, which is to say, as </p><p>the doctor will perceive, that he refuses to </p><p>speak concerning that which is to him </p><p>sacred and forbidden.” </p><p> “Tabu, eh? Um. Well, ask him di-</p><p>rectly why he wishes us to see the ceremony; </p><p>whether all strangers are invited, or whether </p><p>he has just taken a fancy to our pretty </p><p>faces?” </p><p> “1 hasten to obey, but the product thereof</p><p>will be excessively more lies than the leaves </p><p>on the sacred tree. His ears, as I have in- </p><p>timated, are made deaf by the clamor of </p><p>our words,” reported Ali. “He intimates </p><p>exquisitely politely that he would retire </p><p>with the offerings of the white chief, saying </p><p>that the bird of happiness will bang her </p><p>wings in his breast so excessively that he </p><p>will not be able to sleep, because the white </p><p>chief has willingly taken the acceptance to </p><p>the marriage-feast.” </p><p> “Um. Well, tell Yamagulu to give</p><p>him whatever you think, Ali, and bundle </p><p>him off to bed.”	%</p><p> Ah’s voice raised to summon Yamagulu,</p><p>then appeared muffled as if deliberately </p><p>hushed by clammy hands of the air on</p><p>which rolled, with the rhythmic certainty </p><p>of an Atlantic swell, the somber notes of </p><p>the drum. </p><p>^ “What the devil’s that drum for, Ali?” </p><p>inquired the doctor irritably as he gazed at </p><p>the fire, pondering. </p><p> “It is designed to prepare the mind and</p><p>the body for the marriage-feast upon the </p><p>full moon, Doctor.” </p><p> “Why, that’s about tomorrow or the next</p><p>day, isn't it?” observed the doctor, glancing </p><p>up at the battered moon. </p><p> “Two nights more yet.”</p><p>Ill </p><p>IN THE steamy heat of the morn- </p><p>ing the first conscious impression </p><p>of the doctor was that a pulse was </p><p>beating in his brain. The mental effort of </p><p>an automatic medical diagnosis awoke him </p><p>to the reality of the merciless beat of the </p><p>drum. He swore violently and shouted for </p><p>coffee. Outside the net the flies had al- </p><p>ready taken over the duty of torment from </p><p>the mosquitoes. The doctor breakfasted </p><p>on river-fish in an exceedingly bad temper. </p><p> The inconvenience of the camp-site began</p><p>to weaken his resolution to stay even the </p><p>few days. In the jungle one had not to </p><p>scratch all day as well as all night. He </p><p>consulted Ali but as ever merely elicited </p><p>the imperturbable, “Allah only knows.” </p><p>The doctor gulped the quinine he was in the </p><p>act of swallowing. The brilliant black eyes </p><p>of Ali in his bronze cameo features regarded </p><p>him coldly. </p><p> “If the doctor would permit himself to</p><p>meditate upon the Occidental and the </p><p>Or-” </p><p>“Meditate!” spluttered the doctor, covet- </p><p>ing the irrefragable composure of the Arab. </p><p>*l-it, I believe I’ve a touch of malaria. </p><p>Tell Yamagulu to get me the thermometer.” </p><p> But his temperature was normal and his</p><p>pulse as steady as the drum-throb. Later </p><p>in the morning he persisted in visiting the </p><p>old chief, Basayaguru, in spite of Airs as- </p><p>surance that no more information would be </p><p>forthcoming. But at any rate an audience </p><p>would serve to fill up time. The old man, in </p><p>token of his greatness and beauty, was so fat </p><p>that he could scarcely walk. He lay like a </p><p>baby hippopotamus upon his skins in the </p><p>perpetual shadows of his square hut and ap- </p><p>peared to do nothing save eat, drink, snuff </p><p>and sleep, leaving affairs of war and peace </p><p>to his son and politics perforce to Yamala, </p><p>the witch-doctor. </p><p>To each of the questions put by Ali on</p><p>the white man's behalf, he merely grunted </p><p>Adventure, </p><p>non-committally, a process which led one to </p><p>suppose that he was innocent of every crime </p><p>as well as virtue that the black mind could </p><p>conceive. The only articulate sentence elic- </p><p>ited was an order to a slave to send the </p><p>white chief another present of a large tusk </p><p>of ivory. The doctor regarded the tusk in </p><p>dismay. </p><p> “What’s the meaning of this?” he de-</p><p>manded of Ali. “We can’t possibly make </p><p>return presents of anywhere near the value </p><p>of these three tusks and the small ones. </p><p>What do you think he’s after? My Ex- </p><p>press? Because he won’t get that, natu- </p><p>rally.” </p><p> “Allah only knows.”</p><p> “Oh!” The doctor plucked savagely at</p><p>his beard. “Ali, I ask what you think, </p><p>not what Allah thinks.” </p><p> “It is impossible to state, Doctor. Never</p><p>have I witnessed such exquisite generosity </p><p>from a native negro.” </p><p> The little doctor returned to the camp,</p><p>feeling, as he remarked to Ali, that there </p><p>was something in this confounded country </p><p>that would make a saint irritable. And, as he </p><p>retired beneath the mosquito-net for a </p><p>siesta, he grinned at the recollection of the </p><p>sage advice based on theoretical knowledge </p><p>he had given to clients about to leave for </p><p>the tropics, to guard against irritation and </p><p>liquor. During the hottest hours, when man </p><p>and beast and bird, but not woman, made </p><p>obeisance to the sun, the heart-throb of the </p><p>drum continued mercilessly until the doctor </p><p>in his sudorific bath struggled with an im- </p><p>pulse to seize his Express and make an end </p><p>of the tormentor. </p><p> At about four he suddenly grabbed the</p><p>gun and, summoning Yamagulu, decided </p><p>that he would seek something upon which </p><p>he could wreak his exasperation. Yama- </p><p>gulu very naturally protested that neither </p><p>bird nor beast would be stirring before the </p><p>cool of the sinking sun, but the little doctor </p><p>felt that in such a country to thrust forward </p><p>reason was positively indecent and as in- </p><p>congruous as a Socratian debate in a lunatic </p><p>asylum. </p><p> In the village not a body stirred. Unno-</p><p>ticed they selected the small canoe and em- </p><p>barked. The doctor directed the sullen </p><p>Yamagulu to paddle down-stream along </p><p>the bank until they should find fairly solid </p><p>ground to land. About half a mile away, as </p><p>they coasted just outside the guardian</p><p>swamp, he perceived a narrow passage in </p><p>the dense reed as if made by canoes. Up </p><p>this turgid waterway the doctor insisted </p><p>upon going. Fifty yards’ paddling and reed </p><p>hauling brought them within the line of the </p><p>great trees and upon fairly solid earth be- </p><p>neath the dense jungle. </p><p> The doctor and the sullen Yamagulu</p><p>landed and tore their way for some dis- </p><p>tance, earning a bath of sweat in the proc- </p><p>ess. But this did not deter the doctor, who </p><p>had obstinately made up his mind that he </p><p>wanted distraction from the deadly ennui </p><p>of the village. Farther on they struck </p><p>higher ground and came upoD a grove of </p><p>considerable size. </p><p> Suddenly the sulky Yamagulu came to</p><p>life and, touching the doctor’s arm, pointed </p><p>with his spear down the grove. The doctor </p><p>failed to distinguish anything in the tangle </p><p>of grass and bush. Then, just as he was </p><p>about to whisper, he detected part of a bush </p><p>that seemed to move. Slowly grew the </p><p>form of some large animaL Calculating for </p><p>the region of the heart, the doctor fired. A </p><p>convulsive motion of the bush, and there </p><p>leaped forth a big buck, high in the shoul- </p><p>ders and dappled like forest light and </p><p>shadow. </p><p> Again the doctor fired. The beast swerved</p><p>to the right and disappeared. Yamagulu </p><p>raced forward. The doctor followed and </p><p>found him beside the buck. The first shot </p><p>had been a fluke; striking the animal in the </p><p>quarters as it had turned to flee, the bullet </p><p>had lodged in the spine, killing it instantly. </p><p> “Okapi!” gasped the exultant doctor.</p><p> But, as he stoojied, Yamagulu. grinning</p><p>delightedly, drew his attention to a broad </p><p>spoor through the dense grass which ten </p><p>yards from the kill was streaked with blood, </p><p>revealing that in all probability the mate </p><p>was severely if not mortally wounded. Ex- </p><p>citedly the doctor bade Yamagulu to stay </p><p>and skin the slain animal and hurried off on </p><p>the trail. </p><p> The beast was big and evidently bleeding</p><p>heavily; so the spoor was easy to follow even </p><p>for a white man. On panted the doctor, </p><p>forgetful, as ever a hunter is, that time after </p><p>all is an arbitrary affair. The ground rose </p><p>steadily. The going became better at every </p><p>yard. Where the trail led through thick </p><p>bush, the beast had already forced a pas- </p><p>sage. As the ground sank into a slight val- </p><p>ley, he caught a glimpse of the okapi as it </p><p>dashed off from a shelter where it had ap- </p><p>parently rested for a moment.</p><p>The Tree of Life </p><p> Wiping raining sweat from his eyes, the</p><p>enthusiastic doctor plugged on down into a </p><p>bog to his waist, dragged himself up the </p><p>other side and on—and on—and on the </p><p>littje man struggled until quite suddenly </p><p>the trail disappeared in a patch of jungle as </p><p>thick as a grass mat. The doctor hunted </p><p>furiously about—then with more care. No </p><p>sign of blood; the blood-trail had disap- </p><p>peared entirely; not even a broken grass </p><p>stem or twig could he find. Perhaps he </p><p>had overrun the trail? </p><p> He cast about in circles. Fatigued and</p><p>panting, he sat down to rest and wipe his </p><p>streaming face. Just as he was about to </p><p>make another effort, it suddenly occurred to </p><p>him that the shadows seemed very dense. </p><p>He glanced up through the leafy roof. The </p><p>glittering ball of the sun was topping the </p><p>trees. In a panic he snatched his watch. </p><p>He stared incredulously at the nands point- </p><p>ing to a quarter past five. Only another </p><p>three-quarters of an hour to sunset. </p><p> “-!” he muttered disappointedly.</p><p>“I’ll have to give him up now. I’ll go back </p><p>and help Yamagulu finish the skinning.” </p><p> A rational and wise decision of the doc-</p><p>tor’s. He stepped forward briskly, hesi- </p><p>tated, made a pace and stopped altogether. </p><p>He glanced about in a bewildered childlike </p><p>fashion at the wall of tree trunks festooned </p><p>with creepers. </p><p> “When the devil—what the—oh.”</p><p> Again he stared around more incredu-</p><p>lously. Then very softly he said— </p><p> “Oh, God!”</p><p>HE HAD no more idea of the direc- </p><p>tion from which he had come than </p><p>of the secret of the cult. He was </p><p>fatigued. So he sat down again, sagely </p><p>concluding that he might as well rest while </p><p>he thought the matter out systematically. </p><p>Yes. Systematically; that was the thing to </p><p>do. Now where was the sun when they had </p><p>killed the buck? Um. Ah. At first he </p><p>was sure that it had been over his right </p><p>shoulder; then as equally positive that it </p><p>had been behind him. Finally he con- </p><p>cluded that there hadn't been any-sun </p><p>at all. </p><p> For a few moments the doctor was occu-</p><p>pied in informing himself exactly how many </p><p>different kinds of a fool he was; he be- </p><p>thought himself of Yamagulu and proceeded </p><p>to inform the. African continent what par- </p><p>ticular species of criminal idiots it pro- </p><p>163</p><p>duced. Then he plucked at his beard and </p><p>glanced at his watch again. Remained </p><p>about forty minutes of daylight—that is, </p><p>forest semi-gloom. Tropical twilight was </p><p>the only thing in Africa in a hurry, decided </p><p>the doctor bitterly. Then he rose deter- </p><p>minedly and, choosing a direction at ran- </p><p>dom, made the amusing assertion that he </p><p>would continue in a straight line. </p><p> Within twenty yards he was bogged; he</p><p>tried another direction and found impene- </p><p>trable thicket; a third attempt found an- </p><p>other bog. A puzzled wonder as to how the </p><p>deuce he had ever arrived where he was </p><p>if the confounded jungle was nothing but </p><p>swamp-holes was broken by a brilliant idea. </p><p>Of course! He would just fire a few shots </p><p>which would bring the fool Yamagulu to </p><p>him. Accordingly at intervals of half a </p><p>minute he proceeded to carry out the </p><p>scheme, which, however, was arrested by the </p><p>appalling discovery that he only had left </p><p>another ten cartridges—with the probability </p><p>of spending the night in the jungle. </p><p> For a while he stood still, trying to con-</p><p>centrate upon listening for the expected yell </p><p>from the succoring Yamagulu. In a few </p><p>moments he became aware of the voice of </p><p>the forest: a continued twittering hum, </p><p>murmurs like lachrymose sighs, tiny squeaks </p><p>and whispers, mysterious rustles, a sudden </p><p>chatter and a harsh squawk, then a faint </p><p>hooting. He fired another two cartridges </p><p>in rapid succession. The echoes appeared </p><p>like derisive laughter. A sudden screech </p><p>behind him made him start convulsively. </p><p> “-!’’ he muttered as if afraid to speak</p><p>too loud lest some one hear. “I need a dose </p><p>of bromide.” </p><p> The gloom appeared to be deepening with</p><p>a hissing noise as if it were slithering through </p><p>the leaves. Erupted unbidden into his </p><p>mind an exact knowledge of African car- </p><p>nivora. He glanced questioninglv toward a </p><p>tree. Images of gorillas and snakes shut- </p><p>tered his eyes swiftly. He grew violently </p><p>angry with himself at the discovery that he </p><p>was searching for things in the darkness. </p><p>Suddenly he cursed aloud, as if challenging </p><p>the whole menagerie of animals, and started </p><p>off swiftly straight ahead of him. </p><p> Fighting with an impulse to run, strug-</p><p>gling to suppress imagination, the doctor </p><p>plowed on, tearing far more desperately </p><p>than he realized, through thickets of creep- </p><p>ers, tacking beside swamp-holes. Firmly he </p><p>persisted in telling himself his exact medical </p><p>164</p><p>Adventure </p><p>condition. The forest appeared to over- </p><p>hear his thoughts and to laugh in rustling, </p><p>weeping, insidious chuckles. Against his </p><p>will he pulled out his watch repeatedly to </p><p>peer at it in the gloom. Then he tore on to </p><p>stop a moment to listen for Yamagulu’s cry, </p><p>only to hear the forest tuning up for the </p><p>nocturnal anthem. </p><p> The gloom was so dense now that he</p><p>could not see ahead of him. The canopied </p><p>roof seemed writhing with innumerable </p><p>arms, groping down—down. He crashed </p><p>hastily through a tangle of creepers which </p><p>seemed to be trying to strangle him, </p><p>splashed in water and saw the gleam of </p><p>moonlight on water. He stopped, drown- </p><p>ing mosquitoes in his own sweat, wondered </p><p>where he was, hoped that it was the creek </p><p>and shouted— </p><p> “Yama-gu-o-o-o-o-o.”</p><p> “Oo-oo-oo-o!” answered him.</p><p> A violent .squawk brought him face</p><p>about with his rille to his shoulder. The </p><p>forest murmured and sighed; mosquitoes </p><p>buzzed in clouds. </p><p> Yie-e! squealed a bird at him.</p><p> Muttering something about a tree, he</p><p>blundered on along the swamp edge, fell </p><p>over something and grabbed. His hand </p><p>clutched the edge of a small canoe drawn </p><p>up on the swamp grass. At first hope </p><p>made him think that it was his canoe and </p><p>that Yamagulu was in the forest looking </p><p>for him. He gave a mighty yell. That </p><p>sobbing echo closed his mouth. A short </p><p>investigation showed him that the canoe </p><p>was smaller than his own. He glanced </p><p>across the glimmer of water at the dense </p><p>wall of the opposite jungle. Then sud- </p><p>denly like a caress he became aware of the </p><p>regular pulse of a distant drum. </p><p> Desire carried the conviction that he had</p><p>landed on the farther side of the creek from </p><p>the village and that therefore by crossing </p><p>he could make the camp by following the </p><p>drum. He placed the rifle in, pushed the </p><p>canoe hurriedly over the swamp up to his </p><p>knees and clambered aboard. Pulling the </p><p>canoe along the swamp-grass, he made deep </p><p>water and began to paddle with his hands. </p><p>A dark object near the other side, which he </p><p>thought was a floating log, suddenly </p><p>splashed and disappeared. </p><p> “Crocodiles!” he gasped and paddled</p><p>furiously. </p><p> He landed without mishap, dragged the</p><p>canoe up as far as possible and stopped to</p><p>listen for the drum. He could hear noth- </p><p>ing save the weep of the jungle. The cur- </p><p>tain of the trees cut off the vibrations. He </p><p>hesitated a moment before plunging into the </p><p>dense shadows. The ground became firmer; </p><p>it began to rise. On and on he struggled’ </p><p>scarcely conscious of the mosquitoes. Again </p><p>he saw the moon and a few paces farther on </p><p>stood on to the edge of a great glade. A </p><p>glow caught his eager eyes. He hastened </p><p>toward it. In the moonlight was the faint </p><p>outline of a hut. </p><p> “Thank God!" he muttered. “The vil-</p><p>lage!” </p><p> As he hurried on, he perceived a great</p><p>fence around the hut in which was the glow </p><p>of a fire at the base of an enormous tree. </p><p>The doctor reached the fence and peered </p><p>through. He put up his hand and wiped </p><p>his eyes. </p><p> “My God!" he murmured. “Am I crazy?”</p><p> Seated beneath the great tree in a camp-</p><p>chair in the moonlight was a bearded white </p><p>man in full evening dress; an opera hat was </p><p>tilted on liis head; the firelight glowed upon </p><p>the expanse of shirtfront. </p><p>rv </p><p>“HALLUCINATION!” muttered </p><p>the doctor and pawed at his damp </p><p>faceagain. But the image remained. </p><p>The head wras sunk forward slightly; the </p><p>brown beard straggled over the shirtfront; </p><p>one black-sleeved arm hung listlessly out- </p><p>side the chair, the other upon the right </p><p>knee. In the moonlight the eyes glinted </p><p>blue as the man stared at the fire. </p><p> “But a white man in evening kit!” whis-</p><p>pered the doctor incredulously. “Here! </p><p>Good God! No, no,” he added after par- </p><p>ing at the outline of a square hut built be- </p><p>neath the enormous boughs of the giant </p><p>tree. “It is. I’m not crazy. The feller’s </p><p>crazy. Evening kit—good God! What </p><p>the—he must be crazy, poor devil!” </p><p> The impulse to call out was inhibited.</p><p>He began to form excuses to himself. </p><p> “I mustn’t call out suddenly,” he reflected,</p><p>“or maybe I shall scare the fife out of him. </p><p>I must humor the poor devil. Yes, yes. </p><p>Of course—unbalanced. They do go that </p><p>way out here. Queer. Understand it, too, </p><p>begad! Been in the forest all night per- </p><p>haps, poor devil,” he added quite as uncon- </p><p>scious of the ludicrous as of the fact jhat he </p><p>was in reality talking about himself. </p><p>The Tree of Life </p><p>165 </p><p> He opened his mouth and drew in his</p><p>breath, yet he did not call out. He </p><p>wriggled his shoulders as if trying to shake </p><p>off an incubus. Then he realized that he </p><p>was fearful that, if he shouted, the vision </p><p>would disappear and he would know that he </p><p>was crazy. He peered silently for a few </p><p>moments, blinking his eyes. </p><p> “No,” he decided. “It is real. -</p><p>queer. That bloody forest upset my </p><p>nerves. Um, Um. Better find the gate </p><p>and let him see me when I shout. Mustn’t </p><p>scare the poor devil.” </p><p> He began to move cautiously along the</p><p>palisade, six feet high, made of stout sap- </p><p>lings, swallowing and muttering excuses to </p><p>account to himself for not shouting. Stop- </p><p>ping occasionally to peep through the in- </p><p>terstices, he followed the circle until he came </p><p>to the great trunk of the tree, fully fifteen </p><p>feet in diameter. He paused again for an- </p><p>other look. That the vision was still there </p><p>he noted with a feeling of reassurance. As </p><p>he walked around the trunk, he was vaguely </p><p>conscious that it faced an open expanse of </p><p>the great grove, a cavern of basalt floored </p><p>with jade and topped with fantastic pinna- </p><p>cles of chrysoprase. </p><p> On the other side he came upon the gate</p><p>barred with great heavy balks of timber. </p><p>The man sat exactly in the same position; </p><p>had not moved a finger apparently. A </p><p>wild thought that he was dead flitted across </p><p>the doctor's mind. He began to draw </p><p>breath to shout but stopped in indecision. </p><p>What should he say? “Hi? Hullo?” Per- </p><p>haps the man was not English. Probably </p><p>not? What then? The question grew into </p><p>absurd importance. Still the doctor stared </p><p>through the balk gate. The rustle of some- </p><p>thing in the grass behind him evoked an un- </p><p>easy movement and a clutching at the rifle, </p><p>destroyed the fascination in the ludicrous </p><p>argument as to exactly what he should say. </p><p> “I say, hullo!”</p><p> The man did not stir. Then the doctor</p><p>was aware that 'he had whispered. He </p><p>gripped his rifle lightly and with effort </p><p>shouted— </p><p> “Hull-o!”</p><p> “O-o!” repeated the grove.</p><p> The doctor glared anxiously, dreading</p><p>that the figure would disappear. But the </p><p>head rose slowly; the eyes moved. Again </p><p>the head sank despondently. </p><p> “lhank God, he is there,” muttered the</p><p>doctor, “but he thinks I’m an owl.” </p><p> “I say—er—hullo!”</p><p> Once more the beard rose slowly.</p><p> “I say, I’m here!” continued the doctor</p><p>fatuously. He could see the eyes staring </p><p>as if mildly inquiring in the moonlight. “I </p><p>say, old chap, are you English? It’s all </p><p>right! Er—would you mind letting me in?” </p><p>He perceived the beard to part suddenly, </p><p>disclosing white teeth. The man was </p><p>smiling. </p><p> “Good God,” murmured the doctor.</p><p>“He is crazy. Poor feller! </p><p> “I say,” he began again, enunciating care-</p><p>fully, “I’ve lost—my—way, y’know. Would </p><p>you mind—letting me in? I’m Herd- </p><p>wether—Borden Millar Herd wether. Oh </p><p>-! Hi! I’m an English doctor, Mag- </p><p>dalen and London. I say, aren’t you En- </p><p>glish? Par/ez-vous franqais ? Eh?” </p><p> Still smiling distinctly in the moonlight,</p><p>the man raised a white hand and slowly </p><p>waved it toward the doctor. </p><p> “My God!” ejaculated the doctor, shud-</p><p>dering involuntarily. “.Am I crazy or are </p><p>you?” </p><p> He stared. The eyes resumed the de-</p><p>spondent contemplation of the fire. </p><p> “What on earth am I to do? He thinks</p><p>I’m not here, and I thought he wasn’t.” He </p><p>pawed at his damp hair. “If I throw any- </p><p>thing to attract his attention, he’ll think I’m </p><p>a lion or some wild animal. And I’m not.” </p><p>The little doctor was unconscious of the </p><p>whimper in his voice. “I can’t stop out </p><p>here all uight, -it, and who is he, any- </p><p>way? But what’s he want to dress for?” </p><p>he complained bitterly and glanced behind </p><p>him at the cavern of the grove. </p><p> The doctor became aware of an illusion</p><p>that he was within a barred cage like a cap- </p><p>tive monkey and that the man inside the </p><p>fence was free. “There must be wild ani- </p><p>mals, or else he wouldn’t have this con- </p><p>founded fence. Um.” </p><p> The strange man rose to his feet, yawned</p><p>and stretched his arms. </p><p> “O God, he’s going to bed!” muttered the</p><p>doctor resentfully. “It can’t be more than </p><p>nine o’clock.” Then desperately, as the tall </p><p>black back revealed the swallow tails, he </p><p>shouted: “Hii! For God’s sake, let me in!” </p><p>The tall figure turned sharply in his direc- </p><p>tion. </p><p> “Yes!” bawled the doctor. “It’s all</p><p>right! I’m here, I tell you! Herdwetlier!” </p><p>The man was staring in his direction. </p><p>“Yes, yes, come and let me in, and I’ll </p><p>i66 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>explain!” The beard waggled slowly as if in</p><p>regretful dissent. “I am here!” yelled Lhe </p><p>doctor frantically. “Englishman. Doctor. </p><p>I’m lost. Help!” </p><p> The man took two paces, stopped, and</p><p>spoke incomprehensible words. </p><p> “No! no!” screamed the doctor. “Speak</p><p>English! P cadet franqaisl” </p><p> He could sec the beard move as if the</p><p>man were talking to himself. Suddenly </p><p>the fellow stoo]&gt;ed, picked up a glowing fire- </p><p>brand and slowly walked toward the gate. </p><p> “God, he thinks I'm a gorilla,” muttered</p><p>the doctor and involuntarily brought up his </p><p>ritie. </p><p> “For God’s sake, speak, man!” he yelled.</p><p>“I’m real, 1 tell you! I’m a white man!” </p><p>The bearded man in full evening dress with </p><p>a firebrand in his hand stopped abruptly </p><p>and stared toward the fence. </p><p> “A white man!” he exclaimed. “Where?</p><p>Oh, my God, where?” </p><p> “Here! Here! I’m lost! Let me in! I’m</p><p>lost!” </p><p> The man hesitated, moved as if to throw</p><p>away the brand, arrested his arm and </p><p>stooped again to peer at the fence. </p><p> “Who and what are you?” he demanded.</p><p>“Are you real—or am I crazy? Speak!” </p><p>"“No. No. I’m real!” shouted the doctor. </p><p>“I’m English, I tell you.” </p><p> THE man appeared satisfied, for</p><p>he threw away the firebrand and </p><p>advanced with long eager strides ' </p><p>toward the gate, wrenched up the balks of </p><p>timber and then, as if suddenly suspicious, </p><p>leaped backward clear of the entrance. </p><p>The doctor walked through, took off his hel- </p><p>met and held out his hand. </p><p>“How d'you do, sir! I’m Herdwether.” </p><p>The big man gazed down at him and </p><p>placed a hand to his forehead perplexedly. </p><p> “I suppose it’s all right,” he mumbled.</p><p>“-if I know. Er—how d’vou do!” He </p><p>touched the extended hand perfunctorily. </p><p>“I—er—don’t quite understand—yet. You </p><p>said—are you a white man?” </p><p> “Yes, yes,” said the doctor soothingly.</p><p>“Wliite, I assure you. English doctor, </p><p>y’know. I—er—lost my way and—and </p><p>saw your fire; so I just came along.” </p><p> “Oh.”</p><p> The eyes were still regarding him rather</p><p>like a great child, uncertain as to w-hether </p><p>the visitor was a tramp or an angel. </p><p> “My name’s Herdwether—Borden Millar</p><p>Herdwether. I'm here on a commission, </p><p>y’know. Forgive me. I haven’t the pleas^ </p><p>ure-”</p><p> “Eh? Oh.”</p><p> Gazing incredulously, the man shook his</p><p>l&gt;eard as if trying to throw off an illusion. </p><p>“Sorry. Er—I'm Bukely—Warren-Dukelv, </p><p>y’know.” </p><p> “What! Warren-Dukely, the explorer?”</p><p>exclaimed the doctor in astonishment. </p><p> The man giggled, throwing Ijack his head.</p><p> “I beg your pardon!” he added more</p><p>rationally. </p><p> “Not at all,” said the doctor. “Not at</p><p>all. Er—I wonder if you’d mind if we sit </p><p>down? I—er—I'm rather fagged out.” </p><p> “Fagged out, what?” The words ap-</p><p>peared to act as a restorative. “I say, </p><p>I’m awfully sorry. Of course! Come </p><p>along." He started off toward the fire, </p><p>stopped abruptly and, murmuring, “For- </p><p>gotten the door, old boy!” hurried back and </p><p>readjusted the balks. </p><p> The doctor waited for him. trying to</p><p>catch a glimpse of the face. The man re- </p><p>turned with great eager strides and to the </p><p>doctor’s amazement caught him by the </p><p>shoulders and spun him around face to the </p><p>moon. </p><p> “Good God Almighty!” he exclaimed.</p><p>“That's good!" He dropped him as sud- </p><p>denly. “I say, I beg your pardon! You </p><p>must forgive me, I—er—I'm a little off my </p><p>chump, y’know. I—well, as a matter of </p><p>fact. I haven’t seen a white man for years. </p><p>1 don’t know. I—but come and sit down.” </p><p>He strode forward to the hut, his swallow </p><p>tails flirting in the moonlight, and emerged, </p><p>dragging another camp-chair. “Sit down, </p><p>old man. By the way, I didn’t quite </p><p>catch? Herwether?” </p><p> “Herdwether,” said the doctor, sitting,</p><p>and he almost giggled as he saw the man </p><p>pick up his tails as he sat as if he were in a </p><p>club. </p><p> Dukely still stared a little incredulously.</p><p>The doctor observed in the fire-glow the </p><p>gauntness of the cheek-bones and the sunken </p><p>eyes. Embarrassed, he looked at the fire, </p><p>thinking— </p><p> “He can’t be quite crazy if he knows it,</p><p>but what on earth is he dressed for!” </p><p> Conscious of the eyes devouring him, he</p><p>sat still, considerately waiting for his host to </p><p>speak. </p><p>“My God, it’s good to see you!” exclaimed </p><p>Dukely at length. “I—d’you know I heard </p><p>The Tree of Life </p><p>your voice calling, but—but, - it, I </p><p>thought I was dreaming.” </p><p> “I understand,” said the doctor quietly.</p><p>“One gets rather ratty after a while. </p><p>Begin to see things if you’re not careful. </p><p>Er—V you camping near here?” </p><p> “Yes,” assented the doctor. “Down at</p><p>Basa-something’s village, wherever that is. </p><p>I was out shooting, y’know, and got lost.” </p><p>“Oh yes.” </p><p> As he stole a glance at the man, a black</p><p>sleeve crept out, and a hand lightly touched </p><p>his arm. Involuntarily the doctor started. </p><p>Yet he had noticed that the hand was well </p><p>kept, the nails polished. </p><p> There was silence for some minutes. The</p><p>forest murmured and whispered and wept. </p><p>Yet the sinister note was missing to the doc- </p><p>tor’s ears. Twice he glanced up at the </p><p>bearded gaunt face. The man continued </p><p>to stare almost like a yokel gawping at </p><p>a circus fat lady. The doctor was embar- </p><p>rassed. A thousand questions leaped to his </p><p>mind. </p><p> “Er,” he broke out at length. - “I wonder</p><p>whether you have such a thing as a glass of </p><p>water? I’m simply parched.” </p><p> Dukely leaped from his chair as if gal-</p><p>vanized. </p><p> “Certainly, certainly!” he muttered. “I’m</p><p>an awful rotter!” and he disappeared into </p><p>the hut to emerge writh a calabash of water. </p><p> “Oh, thanks very much!” The doctor</p><p>hesitated, glanced at the hut and up at the </p><p>tall man in evening dress. He fumbled at </p><p>his hip pocket. “Um. I—you don’t mind </p><p>if I—do you care for whisky?” </p><p> “Whisky!” echoed Dukely. The eyes</p><p>brightened at the glint of a silver flask and </p><p>were masked politely. “Good God, I </p><p>haven’t tasted whisky for—oh thanks!” </p><p> He almost grabbed, swallowed at a gulp,</p><p>the tot of spirit which the doctor had prof- </p><p>erred in the screw-cap; then he gasped, shak- </p><p>ing his head at Lhe calabash. The doctor took </p><p>his share and a deep drink of water. As he </p><p>placed the calabash on the ground beside </p><p>him, the man sat down slowly and fell to </p><p>gazing at his visitor again without speaking. </p><p> “Good God,” thought the doctor, “is he</p><p>going to stare at me all night?” </p><p> “Er by the way,” said he desperately,</p><p>“have you—are you staying here long?” </p><p> The man started and seemed to shiver.</p><p>He said slowly— </p><p> “Well, I’m going to be married in a day or</p><p>so.” </p><p> “Oh, yes, ah, of course,” assented the doc-</p><p>tor politely. </p><p>“I’m the King of the Wood, y’know.” </p><p>“Oh, yes, yes,” ejaculated the doctor as he</p><p>thought, “My God, he’s as mad as a hatter.” </p><p>V </p><p> THE man with the beard laughed,</p><p> a rusty throaty sound, and stroked</p><p> his nose delicately.</p><p> “I beg your pardon,” said he. “I’m a</p><p>little ratty. I mean I’ve been so long—er— </p><p>here that—I forget that everybody doesn’t </p><p>know—well, who I am and that sort of </p><p>thing.” </p><p> “Quite so, quite so. Very usual phe-</p><p>nomenon.” </p><p> “Of course,” continued the explorer,</p><p>gaining more rationality in the tone of his </p><p>speech and leaning forward in his chair; </p><p>“you probably think I’m as mad as a </p><p>hatter.” The doctor looked away. “Not </p><p>quite—yet.” He stared at the fire medi- </p><p>tatively. “By the way, what did you say </p><p>you were here for, sir?” </p><p> “I’m on a commission; economic and</p><p>social investigation, y’know.” </p><p> “Social, eh? That’s good!” Again he</p><p>emitted a throaty chuckle. “We’re fright- </p><p>fully keen on sociolog}' here. Oh-, yesl </p><p>Er—but didn’t you say you were a medical </p><p>man?” </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “H’m. Perhaps you’ll understand a</p><p>little better. Although I don’t see why </p><p>you should. I mean you won’t be so </p><p>inclined to think I'm quite insane.” </p><p> “Not at all. Not at all.”</p><p> “But you do! Oh yes. Quite natural.</p><p>I should myself. By the way, you’re not </p><p>in a hurry, are you?” </p><p> “Oh no, not at all.”</p><p> The teeth gleamed through the beard</p><p>in a smile at the fire. Dukely shifted rest- </p><p>lessly and looked up again. </p><p> “That whisky of yours, Doctor, has</p><p>bucked me up a lot—pulled me together. </p><p>I ran out six months ago. You know I’m </p><p>not insane.” </p><p> “No, no,” assented the doctor, still won-</p><p>dering. “But have another.” </p><p> “Thanks, old man!”</p><p> The skinny white hand again just re-</p><p>frained from grabbing the screw-cap. </p><p> “By the Lord, that’s good!” he gasped</p><p>as he handed back the flask. “Queer </p><p>168 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>how the bally stuff stings after so long. </p><p>Er. H’m.” </p><p> “Have a cigar?” added the doctor.</p><p>“Good Lord!” Heartiness was creeping </p><p>in to the voice. “That's awfully good of</p><p>you! No, don’t bother for a match.” </p><p> He bent forward, picked a firebrand with</p><p>delicate fingers and sighed at the first </p><p>puff. He sat back seemingly absorbed </p><p>in the joy of the inhalation. The doctor </p><p>began to note details: that the shirt was </p><p>soft and yellow, frayed; the parched skin </p><p>drawn tightly over an acquiline nose, and </p><p>the care bestowed on the liands; even the </p><p>beard had been trimmed. </p><p> “Yes,” began Warren-D ukely reflec-</p><p>tively. “I’m the King of the Wood.” </p><p>Again the doctor was conscious of the </p><p>thrill imparted by insanity. “No, I’m </p><p>not insane, Doc. I—am exactly what </p><p>I say. Let me see. Confound it, there is </p><p>something the matter with my mind. </p><p>Difficult of—er—grasping what I want </p><p>to say. You ought to understand that, </p><p>eh?” </p><p> “Perhaps you haven’t spoken English</p><p>for a long time. Do you think in English?” </p><p>“No, that’s it, by God! Good Lord, </p><p>I never realized il until now. Never </p><p>realized that I was so far gone. H’m. </p><p>Now I will get started! Are vou listening. </p><p>Doc?” </p><p> “Yes, yes, of course.”</p><p> “Well, I was—or am, I suppose—am</p><p>Warren-D ukely—I told you that, didn’t I? </p><p>Yes. All right. Now I’m the King of </p><p>the Wood. - it! Do you hear that </p><p>drum?” </p><p> The doctor listened and was aware of</p><p>the faintest possible vibration. </p><p> “Yes. It’s the drum in the village,</p><p>isn’t it?” </p><p> “Oh yes, the drum all right. Only—”</p><p>He sighed and suddenly placed one hand </p><p>over his eyes as if shutting out a vision. </p><p>“I beg your pardon. I’ll try to get on— </p><p>and tell vou what a mess you’re in.” </p><p> “I am?”</p><p> “Oh, I’ll tell you. Er—about three</p><p>years ago—or was it four? Wrhat’s the </p><p>date, old man?” </p><p> “Date? Oh—er—about the fourteenth of</p><p>February, I think.” </p><p> “God, yes, my stick’s right. That’s the</p><p>drum.”	,</p><p> “What drum?”</p><p> “My drum. But never mind. Er—</p><p>well—oh yes. -it, I wish you’d give mt </p><p>something. But, of course, you can’t— </p><p>here. 1 mean I boggle so. * Don’t you </p><p>nolice it?” </p><p> "A little. l ake your time, old man.”</p><p>“Malaria, 1 suppose. And my quinine</p><p>ran out some time ago.” </p><p>“Oh, I shall be glad to let you have some.’' </p><p>“Let me have some?” The eyes stared </p><p>at the little doctor. “That’s 'good—all </p><p>right. I’ll go on. By the way, did you </p><p>say you were Jesus?” </p><p> “No; Magdalen.’’</p><p> Warren-p ukely smiled at the fire and</p><p>puffed at his cigar, seeming tohaveforgotlen </p><p>his guest The pulse of the drum was </p><p>so faint lliat it appeared like the strokes </p><p>of an invisible baton conducting the noc- </p><p>turnal anthem. A cricket shrilled piercingly </p><p>£nd ceased. A distant prolonged yowl </p><p>was just audible. The doctor was watch- </p><p>ing Warren-Dukely with professionally </p><p>keen eyes; he observed certain spasmodic </p><p>twitches of the bare toes and a persistent </p><p>scratching at the chair arm with one </p><p>polished finger-nail. </p><p> “1 guess I must have been before your</p><p>time, anyway,” he said conversationally. </p><p> “Eh?” The start was convulsive. He</p><p>stared at the doctor; then the eyes smiled. </p><p>“Oh, I beg your pardon. One gets to </p><p>dreaming—more or less. Er—what the </p><p>mischief was I gassing about?” </p><p> “You were going to tell me how you</p><p>became King of the Wood.” </p><p> “King of the Wood? Did I say that—</p><p>really? This cigar seems awful strong, by </p><p>the way. Still, years since I smoked one.” </p><p>Suddenly he sprang to his feet and, </p><p>bending over -the doctor’s chair, touched </p><p>his bare hand as he picked up the calabash. </p><p>He stood with the water in his hand and </p><p>smiled down at the visitor in a relieved </p><p>manner. </p><p> “I wonder whether you could spare?” he</p><p>insinuated. </p><p> “I don’t think you had better,” observed</p><p>the doctor quietly. “A little later perhaps. </p><p>You’re not accustomed to it, y’know.” </p><p>“Quite right! Quite right! And you’ll </p><p>need it yourself. I’d forgotten that.” </p><p> “I’ll need it? Oh, you mean—it isn’t</p><p>that. I’ve a good supply with me.” </p><p> “So had I, old boy; so had I,” muttered</p><p>Warren-Dukely as he turned away with </p><p>the calabash of water in his hand. By the </p><p>chair he stopped, glanced at it and threw </p><p>The Tree of Life </p><p>it away irritably. “- it, I continually </p><p>do that. Carry things about. Still what </p><p>does it matter?’' </p><p> Sticking the cigar in his mouth, he be-</p><p>gan to pace up and down before the fire, </p><p>staring at the ground. The doctor did</p><p>not disturb him. Presently he began with </p><p>a jerk: </p><p>“I’VE got it, by Jove. I know. I </p><p>began yarning about that first </p><p>expedition, didn’t I? Well, after </p><p>that Africa seemed to get in my blood. </p><p>I broke off the engagement with Sybil. </p><p>Had to, only decent thing to do. Can’t </p><p>expect a woman to wait—like a sergeant’s </p><p>wife? An’ one can’t drag her around </p><p>here, eh? 'Sides, I’m not a marrying </p><p>man. Never was. Poor old Sybby. I </p><p>wonder whether she’s still running the </p><p>Cheshire? </p><p> “Oh well, on the second trip I had a</p><p>mania to come through Tchad, pick np </p><p>Boyd .Alexander’s trail—poor old boy— </p><p>and zigzag down through the Albert Lakes </p><p>and land eventually in Rhodesia. I circled </p><p>Tchad and went off to the Dinka country. </p><p>Told you all that though, didn’t I? Well, </p><p>never mind. I tacked back here an’ barged </p><p>into old Basayaguru as you -did, eh? An’ </p><p>the -- old cutthroat made me King of </p><p>the Wood!” </p><p> He stopped to raise his head and emit</p><p>that throaty chuckle. The doctor, watch- </p><p>ing him keenly, began to revise his opinion </p><p>of his sanity. He wheeled round, one hand </p><p>stuck under the tails of his coat and the </p><p>other holding the cigar. </p><p> “Bally idiot, ain’t I?” he demanded.</p><p>“You wait, ol’ boy! Your inning’s next for </p><p>King of the Wood.” He barked rather </p><p>than laughed this time. </p><p> “Still, I’ve played the game, - your</p><p>eyes!” He appeared to be addressing </p><p>somebody unseen, but he said, “No, I </p><p>mean you, Doc.” He began to pace again </p><p>moodily. “Sorry, ol’ chap,” he said as </p><p>abruptly. “You’ll understand as soon </p><p>as I can spit it out. I say, the old boy’s </p><p>very generous with his ivory an’ stuff, </p><p>isn’t he?” </p><p> “Yes."</p><p> “H’m. Thought so. Invited you to</p><p>witness the Marriage of the Sacred Tree, </p><p>didn’t he?” </p><p> “Y-yes,” admitted the little doctor,</p><p>wondering why he felt uneasy. </p><p> “Same hellish trick. Still, it would have</p><p> been the same anyway. How many men</p><p> have you, Doc?”</p><p> “Twenty-five. Three canoes.”</p><p> “All armed?”</p><p> “Well—Sniders enough for all of ’em,</p><p> but-”</p><p> “Oh pish!” he waved an impatient hand.</p><p> “Wrhat bally rot I’m talking. Isn’t a</p><p> dog’s chance. My dear old boy, I had</p><p> fifty—all armed with Martinis.”</p><p> I’m afraid I don’t understand.”</p><p> “Good God, of course you don’t! I say,</p><p> know anything about folklore?”</p><p> “A little.”</p><p> “Talked about the Sacred Tree, didn’t</p><p> they?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Well, that’s the bloody thing there!”</p><p> He raised a hand to the giant tree above</p><p> him. “Mother of all an’ has to have a</p><p> husband every year.”</p><p> “So I understand. My head man, Ali</p><p> Mohammed, told me that they have</p><p> muddled some ancient Arab philosophy</p><p> with their own superstitions. Very inter-</p><p> esting ceremony, I should imagine.”</p><p> “Interestin’ ceremony! -!”</p><p> Agitatedly the tall man began to pace</p><p> up and down before the fire again, sucking</p><p> fiercely at the stump of the cigar.</p><p> “I’m to be the - thing’s husband,”</p><p> he jerked out.</p><p> “Indeed,” said the doctor interestedly,</p><p> for he knew of many ceremonies prevalent</p><p> in Europe as elsewhere of the symbolical</p><p> marriage of a girl to a tree. Then sud-</p><p> denly, “Oh, you mean that they’ve kept</p><p> you here a prisoner for this ceremony of</p><p> theirs? But that’s nonsense. I mean of</p><p> course I’ll help you to-”</p><p> Warren-Dukely wheeled upon him</p><p> swiftly and, pointing his cigar at him,</p><p> cried:</p><p> “But you - fool. I’ve told you</p><p> you're trapped for the next husband.”</p><p> “Husband!” repeated the little doctor</p><p> bewilderedly.</p><p> “Yes, yes.”</p><p> “But what—w’hat happens to you?”</p><p> “Me? I’m sacrificed to this confounded</p><p> ju-ju. Are you blind? The night of the</p><p> marriage orgy they carve me up, wipe out</p><p> your camp and stick you here to make</p><p> magic for twelve moons.”</p><p> “My God!” ejaculated the little doctor,</p><p> half rising to his feet.</p><p>iyo </p><p>Adventure </p><p> VI</p><p>WARREN-DUKELY hurled his </p><p>cigar stump into the fire, turned on </p><p>his heel and flung his body into his </p><p>chair. The doctor remained for a moment, </p><p>staring incredulously; then, as if he had </p><p>grasped the import of the man’s words</p><p>and had decided that they were sane, he </p><p>stood up abruptly and came over to </p><p>Warren-Dukely. </p><p> “This—this seems incredible! Ifi the</p><p>twentieth century! I-” </p><p> The polished nails gleamed in the fire-</p><p>light as the delicate hand patted the </p><p>doctor’s arm half-caressingly, half-reas- </p><p>suringly. </p><p> “It isn’t, my dear old boy; this isn’t!</p><p>It’s before the flood. Sit down, Doc; I feel </p><p>better now I’ve got that off my chest. </p><p>For twelve moons I’ve been dying to tell </p><p>a white man that! My God!” </p><p> “But—is it true?” demanded the doctor,</p><p>conscious of the fingers spasmodically </p><p>clutching his arm. </p><p> “It’s true, all right; true as death!”</p><p>The eyes gleamed as the beard emitted the </p><p>throaty chuckle. “Sit down, old boy.” </p><p>Doctor Herdwether returned to his chair </p><p>confusedly, unable yet to decide whether </p><p>or no the story was the result of a dis- </p><p>ordered brain. Warren-Dukely dragged </p><p>over his chair close beside the doctor’s </p><p>and leaned forward. </p><p> “My brain’s all right now, Doc. Er—</p><p>forgive me, but I can’t resist touching you— </p><p>to see if you’re there, y’know. By the way, </p><p>that’s why I dress sometimes. Just to try </p><p>to keep myself sane. Helps. Can’t fool </p><p>around all day an’ night doin’ nothin’. </p><p>I mean even cleanin’ oneself an’ pretendin’ </p><p>things keeps—oh, reminds one of what </p><p>one was. Otherwise—well, it isn’t done, </p><p>is it? Not playing the game.” </p><p> “But if—what you inferred—we might</p><p>escape—ought not to lose any time.” </p><p>“Time! You dear old thing! I’ve been </p><p>sitting here for twelve moons wastin’ time, </p><p>ain’t I? This is an island: crocs all </p><p>round.” </p><p> “But I’ve got a canoe!” exclaimed the</p><p>doctor. “I came in it.” </p><p> “Really? An’ what the blazes ’s the</p><p>good of that? I tried, old boy. You bet </p><p>your life I did. I hadn’t got a canoe, but </p><p>I got across on a log in spite of the bloody </p><p>crocs. I wished I hadn’t. They got me </p><p> three days—or centuries—later. I dunno.</p><p> Want to live in the jungle, eh?”</p><p> “God!’ said the doctor and shuddered.</p><p> "But we could make my camp an'-”</p><p> “Your camp! In the village, isn't it?</p><p> ‘Sides, did you blaze your trail here, eh?</p><p> W'hich direction did you come from?”</p><p> The little doctor made an inarticulate noise</p><p> as he glanced over liis shoulder. “No, it</p><p> wasn’t that way. That’s where the village</p><p> is. And, I say, for how long d’you think</p><p> we two an’ your twenty-five rats could</p><p> put up a scrap against the mob? My dear</p><p> old boy, we haven’t got a dog’s chance.</p><p> I’ve known it for twelve moons. Come,</p><p> buck up’ an’ we’ll have a chat before we</p><p> go—or rather I go! But I’m not goin’.</p><p> that way, by God! Playing the game or</p><p> not!” v*</p><p> “What do you mean?”</p><p> One long arm shot up like a salute to</p><p> the great bough above them.</p><p> “You’ll see in daylight. Has a pod</p><p> thing. Poison.”</p><p> “But—but—” exclaimed the doctor,</p><p> jumping to his feet.	\</p><p> “But! But!” mocked Warren-Dukelv</p><p> harshly. “What the devil’s the use of</p><p> butting? W’e’re not goats. ’Sides, I've</p><p> butted for twelve bloody moons. Come,</p><p> old boy, let’s have a drink, an’—an’ we’ll</p><p> toddle along to Stone’s an’ finish up at the</p><p> Empire! -! Sit down, man!”</p><p> Suddenly he sprang to his height and</p><p> slapped the doctor on the shoulder so that</p><p> he sat down hurriedly. Then, tilting the</p><p> opera hat upon the side of his head like a</p><p> comedian, he lifted up his beard toward the</p><p> moon and trolled in a husky tenor:</p><p> “Come, landlord, fill the flowing bowl until it doth</p><p> run over—ove-er!</p><p> For tonight we'll mem-, merry be!</p><p> For tonieht we’ll merry, merry be!</p><p> For tonight we'll merry, mcrr-y b-e-e-!</p><p> Tomorrow we’ll be so-ber!’’</p><p> At the last w'ord he snatched off his hat</p><p> and stood bareheaded in the moonlight as</p><p> the forest answered coldly—</p><p> \ “O-be-r.”</p><p> “Listen!” he cried, gesturing largely.</p><p> “There’s my faithful pal! Never goes back.</p><p> Always kgrees with me! The only English</p><p> voice I’ve heard for fourteen moons! Come</p><p> on, old boy! Let’s have a drink. God</p><p> knows I’m dry enough! -!” he ex-</p><p> claimed, crushing the hat beneath his arm</p><p>The Tree of Life </p><p> and bowing satirically to the doctor. “For</p><p> God’s sake, buck up! I’m neither drunk</p><p> nor crazy! But, Lord, you’re the first</p><p> entertainment I’ve had for twelve moons!</p><p> Fourteen moons! Moon! Moons! Moons!</p><p>Nothing but moons! Wilde knew-little </p><p>about moons to what I know! I’ve </p><p>watched; I’ve studied; I've wooed—every </p><p>bloody one of the fourteen moons!” </p><p> “Sit down!” said the doctor sharply.</p><p> “Eh.”</p><p> The tall figure wheeled toward him.</p><p> “Sit down, and we’ll have a drink. But</p><p>don’t get excited.” </p><p> “Excited! You dear old duck, I haven’t</p><p>had such a time since ma died!” </p><p> The hat went careering wildly through</p><p>the moonlight, turned a somersault and </p><p>settled drunkenly on one rim. Warren- </p><p>Dukely dragged his chair a foot, lumped </p><p>into it and caught his hand to his eyes. </p><p> “Sorry, old man; I’ll be good. Fire</p><p>ahead with that drink though.” Then in </p><p>a dreary voice as the doctor pulled out the </p><p>flask, “You know' you haven’t an idea as </p><p>to what this means to me. One gets used </p><p>to anything in life. But—well, I did want </p><p>to speak to a white man once more. Tribal, </p><p>of course, but—” He dropped his hand </p><p>to watch at the gurgle of liquid. “You </p><p>know, Doc, old pal, I’m so - glad to </p><p>see you! I feel like a bally woman wel- </p><p>comin her lover an’ all that sort of thin*. </p><p>I’m glad, but I guess you ain’t.” </p><p> “Here, drink this, and you’ll feel better,”</p><p>said the doctor, proffering the screw-cap. </p><p> “Thanks!” Warren-Dukely gulped the</p><p>liquor at a draft. “Lord, how it bites! </p><p>Now you have a drink, an’ I’ll try to tell </p><p>you what sort of a picnic you’re in for. </p><p>Oh, thanks a million times!” </p><p> He accepted the cigar, lighted it with a</p><p>brand, leaned back and puffed reflectively. </p><p>The distant anthem pulsed steadily. A </p><p>night-bird squawked persistently. The </p><p>faint vibration of the drum just reached </p><p>them. After lighting his cigar, the doctor </p><p>said quietly: </p><p> “You know, Dukely, I can’t quite realize</p><p>this. I-” </p><p> “Of course, you can’t! It’s taken me</p><p>twelve moons to realize it. Oh,-those </p><p>moons.” </p><p> “No; I mean there must be some way-</p><p>out of it. We can’t be murdered by these </p><p>savages.” </p><p> “I object, I admit.” The throaty chuckle</p><p>wTas repeated. “Now let me tell you, an’ </p><p>then you’ll understand, I’ll guarantee. </p><p>Er. H’m. My mind’s foggin’ again. Oh, </p><p>yes, I know-.” </p><p> He stared up at the sinister boughs of</p><p>the giant tree. The eyes hardened. </p><p> The nervous twitching of the fingers</p><p>began again. </p><p> “Yes, I think I can do it. You need</p><p>it, anyhow—to understand.” He leaned </p><p>forward, kicked the embers of the fire into</p><p>a blaze and plunged abruptly: </p><p> “I told you how they caught me, eh?</p><p>With the same trick of apparent friendliness. </p><p>Invited me to the show, y’know. Very </p><p>well. Two days before that drum there </p><p>began. Sound physiological idea. Works </p><p>’em up. All right. On the openin’ night </p><p>I was led here an’ given an orchestra stall </p><p>while the orchestra was tunin’ up. Same </p><p>moon. Same tree. Whole crowd of ’em </p><p>here. Mumblin’ an’ chantin’ just beyond </p><p>there in the open space. Old chief on his </p><p>bally throne tiling an’ the young ’un. </p><p>Master of ceremonies—your pal— Yes, </p><p>I’ll bet he’s been your special friend, eh? </p><p>With his head-dress—looked like a lord </p><p>mayor’s hat. </p><p> “Well, whole bunch of young girls an’</p><p>my illustrious predecessor, the King of the </p><p>Wood. He sat beneath the tree there </p><p>just outside the gate. Of course. I didn't </p><p>twig the game—then. D’you see ’em in </p><p>the moonlight? Then that - drum- </p><p>ming—all the time—persistent—seemed to </p><p>get in your bally head, y’know, or your </p><p>veins—heart. I felt excited myself. Seen </p><p>various sort of dances before an’ all that. </p><p>But—somehow this was different. Real </p><p>thing, I suppose. </p><p> “Sort of tiling they never do for white</p><p>men except when they’re—they’re to be </p><p>the piece de resistance, y’know. But I </p><p>didn’t. They had told me somethin’ about </p><p>the principle of the thing: the marriage </p><p>of the husband person—a great big devil </p><p>by the way, more negro than these people. </p><p>Came from the Kameroons, I believe; </p><p>prisoner of war. They have an amusing </p><p>idea that the bigger the man the more </p><p>the lady—I mean the tree—is pleased. More </p><p>power, I suppose. Of course, white man an* </p><p>white magic an’ all that. </p><p> “Well, they kept up this - drum-</p><p>ming an’ wnigglin’ about—usual witch- </p><p>doctor business—for the devil of a time. </p><p>Drinkin’ all the time native beer, y’know. </p><p>172 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Fermented corn. Then the girls’ stomach- </p><p>dances an’ all that. Meanwhile the big </p><p>feller sat up there in the shadow of the </p><p>tree, sulky, silent. God knows whether </p><p>he knew what was coming. I began to get </p><p>bored.” Again that throaty chuckle with </p><p>a harsh rasp to it. “God—see the same </p><p>old thing all over again. Then, just as the </p><p>moon spilled over that big bough there </p><p>and covered the big negro, there came a</p><p>change. That must have been the mystic </p><p>sign, I suppose. </p><p> “Well, your pal, Yamala, prancing about</p><p>suddenly ceased his croonin’ row and </p><p>darted at the fellow, together with a crowd </p><p>of other black devils. I heard the scream. </p><p>I didn’t realize what. They had him </p><p>stripped over there in the moonlight—an’ </p><p>a knife—old Yamala.” The beard jerked </p><p>as if he were biting his lips. </p><p> “God—I’ve seen things. Of course, you’re</p><p>a doctor an’ used to carvin’—but, God, it </p><p>would have made you sick.” Again he </p><p>moved restlessly in his chair. “They cut </p><p>him alive—screeches—poor devil—then </p><p>they—they put it up there.” He actually </p><p>pointed to the exact spot. Up there in the </p><p>fork of that bough. See? I vomited.” </p><p> The hum of the insectile anthem con-</p><p>tinued remorselessly to the beat of the </p><p>invisible baton. A cricket sang a shrill </p><p>solo and ceased. Far away was the effect </p><p>of sorrow in a hyena. Only one cigar </p><p>glowed like the fierce eye of a dragon. </p><p>From the doctor came an inarUculate noise. </p><p>VII </p><p> WARREN-DUKELY stooped for a</p><p> brand to relight his cigar. He</p><p> puffed thirstily.</p><p> “Twelve moons ago. The Cycle eh? Still.</p><p>Well, then I wanted to go. My head man </p><p>was with me—poor devil! They were too </p><p>busy to notice me. Then—I went off and </p><p>down to the canoes. But there weren’t any </p><p>canoes—at least not where we had landed. </p><p>They must have hidden them somewhere </p><p>else on the island. Of course, I didn’t know </p><p>then that it was an island. Well, I was in a </p><p>-of a rage. I came blunderin’ back here. </p><p>Blood-drunk an’ crazy. Orgy, of course. </p><p> “Just over there cookin’ parts of the</p><p>body on great fires. Blood an’ hair and wo- </p><p>men all over the place. Saturnalia. I might </p><p>as well have expected a rational answer </p><p>from a lunatic asylum. My boy was gone. </p><p>I wish to God I’d shot 'em. I couldn't </p><p>have got 'em all, of course, but most of ’em </p><p>before they had come to their senses. But </p><p>I didn't know. I cleared off an’ walked </p><p>about all night. Then—of course, 1 had not </p><p>a notion—what—what—well, you know </p><p>now. </p><p> “I came back in the dawn. The drums</p><p>were going. Some still dancin’ like stuffed </p><p>vultures. Others gorged, slept. They </p><p>made me sick. I went off an’ sat under a </p><p>tree—that one over there. I decided to </p><p>clear out next day, as I couldn’t undertake</p><p>to wipe out the tribe. Yet I recollect that </p><p>I thought what a toppin account it would </p><p>make in a book. Queer ideas one gets— </p><p>when Fate’s playin’ round. Oh God! </p><p>Y'know, Doc, I’ve wondered sometimes— </p><p>since—when I’ve been wooin’ the moon </p><p>there, whether we aren’t all merely charac- </p><p>ters—an’-rotten ones mostly, eh? In </p><p>a book? What? But, Lord, I’d like to get </p><p>my hands on my author who put me here— </p><p>an’ you. Sorry.” </p><p> He ceased abruptly, puffed twice and</p><p>shot out— </p><p> “Well, what are you goin’ to do about it,</p><p>Doc?” </p><p> “I really don’t know.” The little doc-</p><p>tor’s voice had lost the irritable note; he </p><p>appeared to have regained his consult ing- </p><p>room tone—suave, impersonal. “But what </p><p>did you do then—in the morning?” </p><p> “I do? - an’ Tommy, what d you</p><p>think I could do? They pinched my rifle </p><p>while I slept. Then they trotted me up to </p><p>this place. Oh yes, I objected. Still, they </p><p>were an ugly crowd, an’ lots of ’em. Of </p><p>course, I didn’t know what was up at the </p><p>time. As a matter of fact they flung me in </p><p>here and then skedaddled. I roamed </p><p>around to find out that the darned place was </p><p>an island. Among other things I found </p><p>were about a couple of dozen heads of my </p><p>men, on the trees down there, courteous re- </p><p>minder, y’know. </p><p> “They starved me for three days, an’ then I</p><p>began to find goats left in the stockade here </p><p>while I was away huntin’ round for some </p><p>one to kill. After about ten days of that </p><p>sort of thing, I dunno—they brought one </p><p>of my men in a canoe an’ made him inter- </p><p>pret for me. Of course, I got as mad as —*- </p><p>when the feller told me about the husband </p><p>business of the magic tree an’ all that. He </p><p>said they had all been wiped—except him- </p><p>self—and eaten. </p><p>V </p><p>The Tree of Life </p><p>173 </p><p> “After that I tried to escape. I told you,</p><p>eh? That cured me—or broke me. I dun- </p><p>no. I was delirious when they brought me </p><p>back here. I pulled through an’ found all </p><p>mv gear here—more or less—except guns. </p><p>The other things they thought were magic </p><p>an’ were scared to interfere with ’em, even </p><p>the whisky, thank Heaven.” </p><p> “The whisky?” queried the doctor sharp-</p><p>ly. “Didn’t they drink that?” </p><p> “No. Brought up all, nearly all, my gear</p><p>except my rifles. Didn’t know what whisky </p><p>was probably—or thought it was magic </p><p>stuff.” </p><p> “Oh,” commented the doctor. “Um.</p><p>Um. I say, how about your medicine-chest? </p><p>Have you got it still?” </p><p> “Oh yes; quinine all finished.”</p><p> “Um. How about opium?”</p><p> “Finished, too. You see, old boy, that</p><p>was rather useful sometimes—when the </p><p>whisky had run out. Gives you sleep at </p><p>at any rate.” </p><p> “Got any aconite?”</p><p> “No.”</p><p> “Laudanum?”</p><p> “Finished, too. Partly for same reason;</p><p>also had dysentery, y’know. Why?” </p><p>“Why because I don’t intend to provide </p><p>a post-mortem lecture for your witch- </p><p>doctor friend.” </p><p> “Oh, well you’ll have twelve moons to</p><p>think it over.” </p><p> “Nonsense.”</p><p> Warren-Dukely yawned lazily.</p><p> “You’ll find out, old boy, same as I did.</p><p>A year of contemplation sobers you up a bit. </p><p>What’s it matter after all? I don’t care </p><p>what they do afterward.” </p><p> “Look here, Dukely; get that out of your</p><p>mind.” </p><p> “That’s all right, Doc. You’re fresh an’</p><p>eager—same as I was then. I was mad to </p><p>see a white once more. An’ you’ve given </p><p>me that. Of course, I'm sorry that you’ll </p><p>have to pay such a price for my amusement, </p><p>but,-it, old man, 1 didn’t lug you here, </p><p>did I? I wish you better luck than I’ve </p><p>had. By the way, you’ll find in my effects </p><p>various letters an’ things for my people. </p><p>An’, Doc, if God’s kinder to you than He </p><p>is to me, I want you not to give away </p><p>the cheap horrors to—to my own people </p><p>and pals, an’ don’t let the papers get hold </p><p>of the yarn. </p><p> “I’m not dancin’ round in hell to make</p><p>a journalists’ holiday. All details of my </p><p>trip an’ notes on customs, particularly </p><p>the legends an’ practises among our dear </p><p>friends here, are together in the canvas- </p><p>covered book addressed to the R. G. S.” </p><p>He glanced at the doctor, who was leaning </p><p>forward, elbow's on knees, staring fixedly </p><p>at embers. “Don’t seem interested, eh, </p><p>Doc? You’re right. Talkin’ rot, ain’t I? </p><p>I mean, how the blazes ’re you goin* to get </p><p>’em out yourself? I tried—all sorts of </p><p>crazy ideas. </p><p> “Put notes in bottles an’ chucked ’em</p><p>in the swamp. Island don’t touch the </p><p>main stream; of course they stopped there— </p><p>unless old Surgeon Yamala has found ’em </p><p>an’ turned ’em into ju-ju medicine or </p><p>somethin’. Well, I’m goin’ to turn in. </p><p>Get plenty of rest for the show tomorrow </p><p>night—or is it today.” He glanced at the </p><p>moon. “No; can’t be more than eleven. </p><p>Ha! All the theaters cornin’ out, eh? Poor </p><p>old Piccadilly. Recollect that night I was </p><p>chucked out of the Empire! Ah well— </p><p>I can give you a dose on the floor, Doc, </p><p>same as me.” </p><p>“SIT down,” snapped the doctor </p><p>as he began to rise from his chair. </p><p>“I’ve got an idea.” </p><p> “Sweet infant! So had I by the dozen.</p><p>Brilliant ideas every ten minutes. I know.” </p><p>“Shut up and sit down!” </p><p> “All right, old man. I'm not pressed</p><p>for time. Fire ahead!” </p><p> “Look here; as far as I can make out</p><p>from wrhat you tell me and wrhat I’ve seen, </p><p>we may have a sportin’ chance.” </p><p> “- sportin’!”</p><p> “Shut up, Dukely! You’re fagged.</p><p>With twelve months of this an’ fever an’ </p><p>all that 3'our nerves are in a rotten condi- </p><p>tion, naturally; your constitution’s under- </p><p>mined, which affects your will. You see </p><p>things-” </p><p> “See things! Oh my hat!”</p><p> “I said see things as they are not. Now</p><p>Irv to pull yourself together an’ answer my </p><p>questions.” </p><p> “Certainly, old boy. Fire ahead!”</p><p> “Sit up in your chair with your head</p><p>forward and your back stiff, Dukely,” </p><p>commanded the doctor. “Get that spine- </p><p>less despair out of your mind—just for five </p><p>minutes—and I'll give you a tonic that’ll </p><p>buck you up. That’s'it! Now! What </p><p>time exactly do they begin the—the show?” </p><p>“Eight-thirty; early doors seven!” </p><p>174 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>“Don’t be a - fool, Dukely. I’m </p><p> serious.”</p><p> “Sorry, old boy; thought it was a joke!”</p><p> “Well, what time? Before sunset or</p><p> after?”</p><p> “At the rising of the moon. But what</p><p> that’s got to-”</p><p> “Shut up and listen! Do they start</p><p> drinking immediately?”</p><p> “You bet they do!”</p><p> “Good. What’s the beer kept in? Large</p><p> calabashes?”</p><p> “Yes ”</p><p> “Where?”</p><p> “All over the place. Mostly near the</p><p> tree.”</p><p> “When do they bring the beer?”</p><p> “Bring the beer? Why several days</p><p> beforehand. Has to settle, y’know.”</p><p> “Is it here now, then?”</p><p> “Yes.” Dukely gestured behind him.</p><p> “At the back of my hut there. Gallons of</p><p> the stuff.”</p><p> “Um.” The little doctor wriggled</p><p> slightly. “Now about this tree. What</p><p> is it?”</p><p> “The magic tree. Tree of Life they call</p><p> it.”</p><p> “You said it was poisonous?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Of what species is it?”</p><p> “I dunno. Seems to be- of the same</p><p> family as the baobab—Andansonia^’know.</p><p> But yet quite unlike the baobabs of the</p><p> South. Never seen one like it before.”</p><p> “Um. Citric tribasic,” muttered the</p><p> doctor. “No good.” He stared up at the</p><p> great boughs and, jumping to his feet in his</p><p> nervous- manner, went across and began</p><p> to pick at the bark of the great bole.</p><p> “That’s not Andansonia!” he commented</p><p> with a leap in his voice as he returned to his</p><p> chair. ‘*Don’l know what it is. Un-</p><p> classified, I should say.”</p><p> “No, I don’t think it’s baobab. Wouldn’t</p><p> be poisonous if it were.”</p><p> “Do they ever use it?”</p><p> “Yes. On the—husband. They say that</p><p> it is the blood of the mother which he must</p><p> eat before he is—married.”</p><p> “Ah! What’s the effect?”</p><p> “Oh God, Doc, that’s what I want to</p><p> know. They—they don’t give the poor</p><p> devil a chance to die. The stuff of the pod</p><p> is thrust down his throat an’ then—</p><p> what I described. But what’s the scheme?</p><p> Shove it in the beer an’ poison the swine?</p><p>My hairy aunt!” Dukely leaped to his feet </p><p>with a yell. “You've got it, by God, old </p><p>man!” </p><p> “Wait a minute,” said the doctor quietly.</p><p>“Not so fast.” </p><p> “By God. I feel alive once more! We</p><p>must do it, Doc. That’ll fix them.” </p><p>“That’s the—sit down, Dukely. The </p><p>point is: will it fix ’em? How do we </p><p>know what poison it is? What quantity </p><p>is required to produce the desired effect?” </p><p>“Oh the devil! Oh, it must.” </p><p> “Desire has no effect on organic matter,</p><p>my friend. Um. Um. Haven’t got any </p><p>animals around here to experiment on?” </p><p>“Not a thing. They bring me food every </p><p>morning: fowls and sometimes goats but </p><p>always ready killed.” </p><p> “Um. Wish to heaven we knew what</p><p>family it is.” He stared at the great tree </p><p>by which Lhe moon in midarc was almost </p><p>obscured. “Have you got anything to </p><p>knock down one of these pods?” </p><p> “No, but I’ve some here,” said Warren-</p><p>Dukely, fumbling in his pocket. “I—I </p><p>thought they might be useful in case any- </p><p>thing happened before schedule, y’know.” </p><p>The doctor took one, split it open and </p><p>examined the con ten Ls: seeds embedded in </p><p>a yellowish creamy malLer. </p><p> “Um. Um,” he mullered, sniffing iL.</p><p>“Wonder w'hat the devil it can be. The </p><p>odor seems familiar. Very. What the— </p><p>-if I know. Tastes sweetish,” he added </p><p>putting a grain upon his tongue-tip. </p><p> “For God’s sake be careful, old man!”</p><p>cried Warren-Dukely. </p><p> The doctor held the pod in one hand and</p><p>stared at the moonlit glade. </p><p> “If only I could think what that reminds</p><p>me of. I might get a clue. I’ve half a </p><p>mind to try. Have you any mustard for an </p><p>emetic?” </p><p> “Don’t be crazy, Doc! And I haven’t</p><p>any, anyway. It may be anything; mavbe </p><p>the stuff some of these devils poison their </p><p>arrows with. I knowr that’s a vegetable </p><p>poison of some sort and absolutely deadly.’’ </p><p>“True!” </p><p> “Besides, if it takes a long time, the actual</p><p>knowledge won’t do us any good. I mean </p><p>that’s our only chance either way.” </p><p> “True again. What time do they come</p><p>in with food?” </p><p> “Sunrise or before.”</p><p> “Well, we’ll have to take the chance,</p><p>that’s all. Come, we must fix up the stuff </p><p>The Tree of Life </p><p>175 </p><p>now. Grind it up, I suppose, as much as </p><p>possible, and stick it in their beer. Thank </p><p>heaven it’s sweetish. They probably won’t </p><p>notice it or rather like the sweet effect. </p><p>How much have you got there of the stuff?” </p><p>“Oh, only about a handful, I thought </p><p>that would be enough for me.” </p><p> “Put that idea out of your head,” said</p><p>the doctor sharply. “Now come along. </p><p>I’ll bunk you up on that bough and you </p><p>grab the pods. About a quarter of a pound </p><p>per gallon ought to be enough. If it were</p><p>aconite, it would knock ’em stiff at the first </p><p>gulp.” </p><p> Into the gloom of the great tree’s interior</p><p>disappeared the coat-tails of Warren-Dukely, </p><p>looking like some monstrous wliite-breasted </p><p>bird clumsily seeking to roost. </p><p>vra </p><p>AS A lover hastens to a tryst, so </p><p>rose the sun and rising seemed to </p><p>dally in the pleasance of liis love. </p><p>With the hot kiss upon the dew-tipped </p><p>crest of the giant tree the two white men </p><p>hustled the last of the empty pods into the </p><p>latrine behind the hut. Just as a bird </p><p>raucously announced the capture of his </p><p>prey to his nearby mate, W’arren-Dukely, </p><p>peering through the fence, saw the first </p><p>of the six young girls who daily brought his </p><p>food, for to a layman or woman of the age </p><p>of puberty was it worse than death to come </p><p>within the orbit of the sacred magician’s </p><p>sight, the husband of the Tree of Life, </p><p>arbiter of fecundity in crops and women, </p><p>mother of all, potent and terrible. </p><p> Across the glade tTiey came: lithe young</p><p>forms of ebony moving lissomely from their </p><p>slender waists, bearing upon their immobile </p><p>heads a slain goat, chickens and calabashes </p><p>of sweet water, milk and eggs—for must the </p><p>holy mate of the goddess be propitiated </p><p>and fed sumptuously to avoid his great </p><p>displeasure. </p><p> “Better lie perdue. Doc,” warned Warren-</p><p>Dukely, “while I find out whether they </p><p>know where you are or not—that’s if these </p><p>children know.” </p><p> At the entrance to the palisade the six</p><p>stooped and, having placed the loads upon </p><p>the ground, called shrilly the prescribed </p><p>greeting. Dukely replied. One responded </p><p>in the chanting speech which was obligatory </p><p>in addressing a sacred person. Then in </p><p>single file they turned and glided down the </p><p>glade as if well content to have completed </p><p>their dangerous duties. </p><p> “As I thought, old man,” reported</p><p>Dukely, returning into the hut with the </p><p>groceries. “They know that you’re here. </p><p>And, by way of precaution, I instructed ’em </p><p>to tell our invaluable friend, Yamala, that </p><p>I had summoned you, my brother, to take </p><p>my place after I had—entered into con- </p><p>nubial felicity.” </p><p> “D’you think they’ll swallow that?”</p><p>inquired the little doctor, squatted upon an </p><p>overturned calabash, stroking his beard. </p><p> “Oh Lord, yes! You haven’t learned</p><p>as I have the great prestige of a medicine-</p><p>man. They will expect crops an’ what not </p><p>as never before by the union of such a great </p><p>white magician as I. God, so thoughtful, </p><p>too! I even provide a successor as mighty!” </p><p>“Why,” demanded the doctor with a </p><p>calabash of milk in his hands, “don’t they </p><p>cultivate the glade here near to the source </p><p>of magic power? Seems queer.” </p><p> “Oh no. They dare not do that. The</p><p>island is sacred, as I’ve told you. They </p><p>seem to look upon the ground here as a </p><p>part of the body of the great mother and </p><p>’re scared to hurt her feelings by seratchin’ </p><p>her skin. That’s the idea as I’ve under- </p><p>stood.” </p><p> “H’m, homeopathic magic as usual.”</p><p>Dukely sank down upon the camp-bed. </p><p>“Phew! I'm fagged out. Sorry, old </p><p>man,” he added swiftly, “I’m forgettin’ </p><p>my duties. You must be starving. There’s </p><p>some cold goat in that calabash beside you </p><p>an’ some combread of a sort—sourdough, </p><p>y’know. WTien you’ve eaten, we’d better </p><p>have a sleep. You must need it, by Jove— </p><p>so’s we’ll be fit for the—Diamond Sculls </p><p>tonight,” he added with a chuckle that </p><p>was less harsh. “Oh, by the way, we'll </p><p>need your gun. Doc; so let me have it, </p><p>and I’ll toddle along an’ hide it in a bough </p><p>near where I know now the canoes will be. </p><p>We can pick it up as we go.” </p><p> '‘Good. And you may as well take</p><p>these few cartridges in case they should </p><p>take a fancy to them, eh?” </p><p> As soon as he had gone with the rifle</p><p>and the belt, the little doctor, whose curi- </p><p>osity had been excited by the first glimpse </p><p>of the interior of the hut by daylight, rose </p><p>to note the contents. At one end wras the </p><p>camp-bed with a bepatched mosquito-net; </p><p>in the middle, lacing the door, was a chair </p><p>beside a crude bookcase of shelves formed </p><p>i?6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of sapling logs burned off and strung </p><p>together with bark fiber, containing about </p><p>a dozen volumes, of which the most con- </p><p>spicuous were a volume of the Royal </p><p>Geographical Society’s journals, a Swin- </p><p>burne and a Rabelais and some chunky </p><p>volumes bound in canvas; at the far end </p><p>was a green canvas table on which, set in </p><p>orderly array before a shaving-mirror, were </p><p>a number of small objects which gleamed </p><p>in the half-light. </p><p> Chewing a rib of goat, the doctor rose</p><p>stealthily for a surreptitious peep at a </p><p>complete manicure-set and hair-brushes in</p><p>ivory, gold inlaid. As he handled them </p><p>curiously, he observed on each one a crest </p><p>of what appeared to be a naked scimitar </p><p>blade clasped by a mailed hand. The little </p><p>man took the bone from the nest of his </p><p>beard to grin as he remarked: </p><p> “Totemism! Complete case. Most in-</p><p>teresting, bless the dear! No wonder they </p><p>wanted him for a medicine-man!” </p><p> The sound of the balks of the gate being</p><p>dropped into place sent him scuttling back </p><p>guiltily to his seat on the calabash. </p><p> “Do yourself well!” he observed as</p><p>Dukely entered. </p><p> “Oh yes. But, by the Lord, Doc, old</p><p>man, if it hadn’t been for my pals there, </p><p>I couldn't have stood it. My God, no!” </p><p>The expression in his eyes as they glanced </p><p>at the primitive library w'as almost like </p><p>a dog who knew’ he is about to be parted </p><p>from his master. He swore quietly and </p><p>remarked, “D’you know. Doc, the hardest </p><p>thing’s goin’ to be to leave my pals there </p><p>tonight.” </p><p> “Rot,” said the doctor with the rib of</p><p>goat in his beard. “You can get other </p><p>editions.” But with a glance at the bulky </p><p>canvas books, “It does seem a pity to leave </p><p>these note-books. They are, aren’t thev? </p><p>Um.” </p><p> Warren-Dukely sighed as he stretched</p><p>himself on the bed. </p><p> “Queer,” he observed, staring at the</p><p>grass roof, “a while ago I was willing to— </p><p>oh, cut a dean’s throat to get out of this </p><p>hell, an’ now, when I think I’m good as free, </p><p>I’m wanting to raise Cain ’cause I can’t take </p><p>my worldly goods an’ chattels with me.” </p><p> “Human nature, ol’ boy,” commented</p><p>the doctor, chewing away as contentedly </p><p>as a terrier at the bone. </p><p> “Oh, I beg your pardon, ol’ man!” sud-</p><p>denly cried Dukely, springing from his bed. </p><p>“Look here, you make yourself comfortable </p><p>here! Yes, yes. Courtesy goes to the </p><p>devil an’ all here!” </p><p> “Umgh, Uragh,” grunted the doctor</p><p>through his bone. “Sit down an’ don’t be a </p><p>fool. I’m all right.” </p><p> “No, no.” Dukely dragged one yellow</p><p>pillow from the bed and sprawled on the </p><p>floor. “Turn in when you feel like it. </p><p>Anyway, as soon as you’ve finished sitting </p><p>on my wardrobe, I’ll change. They’d </p><p>probably put me in gaol at Kavaballa’s </p><p>if I arrived in this kit!” he added with a </p><p>slight return of the hysterical note in his </p><p>voice.</p><p>THE doctor, who appeared to have </p><p>lost every trace of his normal irri- </p><p>tability, did not dispute the point </p><p>but, having finished another bone and drunk </p><p>some more milk, rolled on to the bed and </p><p>was asleep in five minutes. Flies buzzed </p><p>in freedom, walked upon the doctor’s nose </p><p>and danced upon his eyelids with im- </p><p>punity; they essayed to hold a carnival upon </p><p>the long figure in khaki crouched upon the </p><p>floor but were repulsed by the bony hand </p><p>of perfect nails. Shadow's dwindled toward </p><p>the west. Parrots began to squawk; a </p><p>wart-hog and his family nosed inquisitively </p><p>around the palisade and went a truffling </p><p>farther up the glade. </p><p> Hornets played busily between the forest</p><p>and a nest of clay beneath the eaves. A </p><p>lizard progressed in suspicious darts across </p><p>the earthen floor, reached the calabash of </p><p>goat abandoned by the doctor and feasted </p><p>most lizardlv upon the swarming flies. </p><p>Suddenly a streak of cobalt blue struck the </p><p>empurpled lizard like dulled lightning, </p><p>and a small snake, startled by a throttled </p><p>gurgle, slithered into a hollow in the wattle </p><p>and daub wall. From the southern end </p><p>of the glade parrots streamed, screeching a </p><p>pessimistic warning. </p><p> Warrcn-Dukelv stirred and arose as</p><p>his keen ears caught a distant chanting. </p><p>He awoke the slumbering doctor. </p><p> “What the—” mumbled the doctor</p><p>resentfully. “Oh.” He sat up abruptly. </p><p>“Oh Lord, yes, I’d forgotten. What’s the </p><p>matter?” </p><p> “Curtain’s going up, old man. Pull</p><p>yourself together. You stop here an’ don’t </p><p>come out unless I call. I’ve got to go an? </p><p>parley with our pal, Yamala. He’s chant- </p><p>ing Gilbert an’ Sullivan stuff down there </p><p>ft </p><p>The Tree of Life	17 7</p><p>at the end of the grove.” </p><p> “What! Are they beginning already?”</p><p>“Not until sunset. My magic is too </p><p>powerful for any except the anoiqted </p><p>sorcerers or whatever you like to call 'em </p><p>while the sun is up. Then the crowd </p><p>comes 'with a rush, an’ they start with a </p><p>song an’ dance act.” </p><p> “But—Dukely, d’you think that they’ve</p><p>already wiped out my camp? That Arab </p><p>of mine, Ali, will put up a fight if he gets </p><p>any warning, an’ he’s no slouch.” </p><p> “God knows! Perhaps they’ll bring him</p><p>up to see the show an’—or—else they may </p><p>take it into their heads to keep him for</p><p>the next year’s magician—particularly if </p><p>he’s a pure-blooded Arab; that is, looks it.” </p><p>“Um. If he knows, he’ll fight like a wild- </p><p>cat. Fine chap, Ah, even if he is tiresome </p><p>sometimes.” A smile twitched the doctor’s </p><p>shaggy eyebrows. “I hope they do bring </p><p>him along if only to see a carven image get </p><p>excited for once. Dear me, how sentimental </p><p>one becomes in post-mortem contemplation.” </p><p>“Oh, shut up!” exclaimed Dukely sharply. </p><p>Then, turning away abruptly, “Look here, </p><p>I’ll toddle along!”' </p><p> As he strode from the hut, the little</p><p>doctor watched him keenly. </p><p> “Um,” he remarked sotto voce, “careless</p><p>of me—very. Nerves in rags. Still, rather </p><p>natural. Um. That food and sleep did </p><p>me good though.” His eyes wandered over </p><p>the ground and alighted on an empty pod </p><p>of the Tree of Life. He picked it up and </p><p>sniffed at it again. “Queer, familiar odor.” </p><p>He stared reflectively at the glare of sun- </p><p>shine without. “-if 1 can recall what </p><p>it reminds me of. Um.” </p><p> From without came Warren-Dukely’s</p><p>voice pitched in the high native chant. </p><p>As it ceased, above the recurring buzz of </p><p>flies came the response like a thin streak </p><p>of troubled sound from a distance. The </p><p>doctor moved toward the door and saw </p><p>the bearded white man turn away from the </p><p>fence to regard the giant tree; he noted a cer- </p><p>tain rigidity in the body and the clenching </p><p>of the fists. The doctor dodged back </p><p>swiftly as Warren-Dukely came to the </p><p>hut. </p><p> “Come on, old man!” he shouted a trifle</p><p>boisterously. “It’s about an hour to sun- </p><p>set. Let’s feed, an’ I’ll fry some eggs </p><p>an’ goat. We can stuff ’em in our pockets </p><p>for the trip tonight.” Averting his eyes, </p><p>he plumped down into the chair by the </p><p>library. “An’, by God, we mustn’t forget </p><p>to stir up the beer before—before the bar </p><p>opens!” </p><p> “Certainly,” assented the doctor, “an’,</p><p>talkin’ about bars, there’s another wee </p><p>droppie left, laddie!” </p><p> “Thank Heaven!” exclaimed Dukely.</p><p>“Let’s drink to—to the holy estate of </p><p>matrimony, by the Lord!” </p><p> “Um,” reflected the little doctor as he</p><p>unscrewed the flask, “he’s fightin’ it </p><p>through, but he may collapse on my hands </p><p>at any moment. Confound it, what does </p><p>that stuff remind me of?” </p><p>DC </p><p> IN A field of malachite within a</p><p>wg canon of the basalt forest before </p><p>Rj' the domed majesty of the Tree of </p><p>Life was spread a quivering fan of ebony, </p><p>whose writhing squirming figures were </p><p>sheened in the blue flood of the moon. In </p><p>the center upon a carven stool was draped </p><p>the girth of the chief, Basayaguru; upon </p><p>his left squatted his son, Basafingu, and </p><p>upon his right, a bearded face of ivory </p><p>and jet, squatted the little doctor beside </p><p>the immobile carving in turquoise of Ali </p><p>Mohammed. </p><p> Before them pranced Yamala, smeared</p><p>in clay, a frenzied skeleton of chalcedony </p><p>from whose high-crested head streamed a </p><p>pennant of red parrot feathers, dancing in </p><p>the humid air as if in wild pursuit of the </p><p>glittering snake which wras the sacred spear, </p><p>to the screeching chant and the throb of the </p><p>drums. Beyond him, beneath the great </p><p>bough in the blue womb of the tree, was </p><p>the glimmer of a white body crouching. </p><p> Around a wriggling group of the six</p><p>doomed and holy maidens leaped the men </p><p>and shuffled the wromen, grunting and </p><p>squealing to the impulse of the drums. </p><p>On every side like giant mushrooms stood </p><p>the great calabashes of the beer from which </p><p>he who willed could drink his fill. </p><p> “God,” muttered the doctor, nervously</p><p>plucking at his beard, “when is this con- </p><p>founded stuff going to work? I don’t even </p><p>know what reactions to look for! AH! </p><p>How far do you reckon that moonlight is </p><p>from Mr. Dukely now?” </p><p> “Undoubtedly within one foot, Doctor.”</p><p>The doctor glanced at the clear-cut </p><p>features which were as cold as rock, and </p><p>he swore resentfully. </p><p>i;8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Dukely,” shouted the doctor above</p><p>the racket, “are you all right?” </p><p> “Yes,” came the reply in a steady voice.</p><p>'They’ll get me in a minute or two.” </p><p>Continuously the blue-sheened limbs </p><p>pranced on; untiringly yelled hysteric </p><p>voices; remorselessly the blue tide of the </p><p>moon rose nearer the bole of the Tree of </p><p>Life, the Mother of All, where crouched the </p><p>unwilling bridegroom. </p><p> After an anxious stare about him the</p><p>doctor fidgeted restlessly and gazed fas- </p><p>cinatedly at die line of creeping moonlight. </p><p> “Is that stuff ever going to work? Ali,”</p><p>sharply, “d’you think we’ve made a mis- </p><p>take? Perhaps it's merely harmless—just </p><p>citric acid of the baobab? Ali!”</p><p> “Allah only knows,” responded Ali tone-</p><p>lessly. </p><p> The doctor swore and began again to</p><p>pluck at his beard. </p><p> “God, Uiis tension’s—look!” he whis-</p><p>pered and clutched at Ali’s robe. </p><p> The enormous bulk of the chief, Basaya-</p><p>guru, beside him was heaving convulsively; </p><p>the head was thrown back until the head- </p><p>dress was almost peqx*ndicular, and the </p><p>mouth was wide open, the jelly face creased </p><p>in a thousand winkles; the eyes were </p><p>dilated, flashing the blue whites; the </p><p>blobby hands clutched at the flabby mass </p><p>of the strained throat. </p><p> “He is drunk, Doctor,” said Ah gravely.</p><p>“He wishes to laugh—exquisitely.” </p><p> “Laugh! Good God, what at?” ex-</p><p>claimed the doctor. </p><p> As he spoke, the ghosdy figure of Yamala,</p><p>the witch-doctor, doubled up in front of </p><p>him, holding his sides as his open mouth </p><p>gasped in a paroxysm of laughter. As sud- </p><p>denly as if indeed a magic wand had been </p><p>waved above them, the drums ceased—the </p><p>screeches died away. Five leaping war- </p><p>riors turned in amazement and stared. A </p><p>yell was turned into a gasping sob. </p><p> Astonished the dot tor stood up. Every</p><p>savage except the six holy maidens was </p><p>rolling about in the grass, holding his sides </p><p>and gasping with laughter. The chief </p><p>beside his son was kicking his fat legs like </p><p>a baby hippopotamus. Into the moon- </p><p>light stepped the ivory figure of the bride- </p><p>groom. Several figures ceased to struggle. </p><p>They lay quietly in the grass. </p><p> “For God’s sake!” began Dukely. “What</p><p>on earth-” </p><p> “Come!” yelled the doctor. “Run for it,</p><p>Dukely, for your life! Ali!” And without ex- </p><p>planation the doctor sprang over the squirm- </p><p>ing figure of the chief, followed by Dukely </p><p>and the sedate Ali. Not until thev had </p><p>reached the tree where the doctor’s gun </p><p>was hidden did he have breath to explain. </p><p> “That smell! ’Course I knew it!” he</p><p>gasped as they trotted through the forest </p><p>to the canoes. “Dentist!” </p><p> “Dentist! Wrhat on earth—” panted</p><p>the ghosdy form of Warren-Dukely. </p><p> “Yes, yes, nitrogen monoxid—probably</p><p>form—pentoxid—Laughing Gas, y'know! </p><p>Asphyxiate ’em for hours—if doesn’t—kill </p><p>’em! There’s the canoes!” </p><p> THE CAMP-T1KE</p><p>A ’Free"to-all TVtoeting-Place for </p><p>Headers Writers &amp; Adventurers</p><p> A WORD from .Clyde B. Hough</p><p> concerning his story in this issue:</p><p>Oakland, Calif. </p><p> At one time I spent a little over eleven months</p><p>on just such an island as is described in this story. </p><p>The size of the island, the reef completely around it, </p><p>the birds and eggs and the method of obtaining </p><p>water, are all statements of facts. The island in the </p><p>story is a true, accurate and complete reproduction </p><p>of the one where I was located.—C. B. Hough. </p><p>HERE’S an answer to the inquiry about </p><p>“Cattle Kate” from one who knew her </p><p>and the circumstances of her hempen de- </p><p>parture. Here’s hoping he tells us other </p><p>incidents of the old days of the West. </p><p>Denver, Colo. </p><p> Used to ramble around the map a little myself,</p><p>putting in about fifteen years of my life looking for </p><p>the place where the other fellow "wasn’t.” </p><p>QINCE settling down I get a lot of fun out of </p><p>our magazine and frequently read of men I </p><p>have whacked blankets with in various parts of the </p><p>West. Was acquainted with a lot of the old-time </p><p>gun-fighters, who, as a general rule, were quiet, un- </p><p>assuming men and the best of partners. </p><p> Have been intending to write a few lines to Camp-</p><p>Fire for some time but kept putting it off until in a </p><p>recent issue some comrade inquired for information </p><p>of “Cattle Kate,” and as I happened to know her </p><p>and a little of her history I thought you would be </p><p>interested. </p><p>J^ATE MAXWELL was bom north of Des </p><p>Moines. Iowa. Her father died when she was a </p><p>little girl, her mother married again, and died when </p><p>Kate was about fifteen. She continued to live with </p><p>her step-dad, who abused her something shameful, </p><p>until she was twenty, when she ran away from home, </p><p>tackling one job after another, until she wound up </p><p>in a dance-hall. Kate arrived in Wyoming and got </p><p>to running with a bunch of rust.lers of which she was </p><p>soon the recognized leader. </p><p> I met her at her hang-out on the Sweetwater</p><p>several months before she was lynched. Was </p><p>about forty-five years old, with a face burnt, the color </p><p>of old brick, black hair streaked with gray, flying </p><p>loose to the wind, a man’s coat and hat, and two big </p><p>forty-fives and the grit of a wildcat. </p><p>*•- Was living with jim Avery, who, I believe, was </p><p>post-master at Sweetwater. Six other hard cases </p><p>made up the gang, Kate being head and shoulders </p><p>the worst of the bunch. As long as she kept to or- </p><p>dinary mailing the cattlemen overlooked her faults. </p><p>Later she got to shooting cows and running off the </p><p>dogies, and then the mob got busy. </p><p>IN THE Spring of 1899 a bunch of twenty men </p><p>1 rode quietly up to her ranch. The gang, with </p><p>the exception of Avery and her nephew, were all </p><p>away. Surrounding the house, part of the crowd</p><p>covered the three of them from the windows, while </p><p>others broke in the door. Both Avery and Kate </p><p>were unarmed, their belts hanging on the wall, so </p><p>got no chance to do any shooting. </p><p> Avery quit cold, and begged, but Kate fought the</p><p>whole bunch bare-handed and the boy tried to knife </p><p>one and got a pistol-butt over the head and was out </p><p>of it. </p><p> The two were rushed out to the corral, a wagon-</p><p>tongue hoisted in the air and both hung with the </p><p>same rope. It is said that Kate offered to fight the </p><p>entire mob with one pistol, and was still cursing </p><p>them until the rope shut her off. The rest of the </p><p>gang swore vengeance, and in less than a year prac- </p><p>tically the whole mob had died with their boots on.— </p><p>Frank L. Schott. </p><p>f I 'HERE follows a slightly different ver- </p><p>sion of the passing of “Cattle Kate.” </p><p>Both the names “Avery” and “Averill” </p><p>are used. And there’s also a word on </p><p>McCoy. </p><p>Shoshoni, Wyo. </p><p> I note in your last issue that L. B. W. wants to</p><p>know something about Cattle Kale and some noto- </p><p>rious outlaw by the name of McCoy. Jim Averill, </p><p>who helped run the eighth Standard Parallel in this </p><p>State, lived on the Sweetwater River, some time in </p><p>the last of the 80’s, with a woman by the name of </p><p>Ella Watson, who had the nickname of Cattle </p><p>Kate. She was a courtezan and while living with </p><p>Averill plied her trade and some of the neighboring </p><p>punchers and owners paid her for favors received in </p><p>mavericks. </p><p>^YERY also was a land surveyor and knew too </p><p>much about the choice bits of Government </p><p>lands which some of the big cow outfits had fenced </p><p>up. Between these two tilings the hatred of some </p><p>of these outfits grew to such an extent that one day </p><p>when Averill and Ella were going to the then new </p><p>town of Casper they were ambushed on the road </p><p>north of the Sweetwater and near the mouth of Dry </p><p>Creek and both were hung on a tree which was still </p><p>standing some four years ago. </p><p> The required coroner’s inquest was held, but the</p><p>paties were never prosecuted. It was a cowardly </p><p>and dastardly crime. Cattle Kate was written up </p><p>179 </p><p>i8o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>in Lhe newspapers in luri&lt;l and fanciful colors as a </p><p>dashing cowgirl, dead shot and a few other things. </p><p>There was nothing to that but hot air. </p><p> As for McCoy the only one answering to the de-</p><p>scription was Bob McCoy of Therutopolis, who was </p><p>killed some few years ago uhder peculiar circum- </p><p>stances. He was shot by unknown parties; his </p><p>body then dragged to the river edge and a nosebag </p><p>strapped around his head and then the body a* far</p><p>as the shoulders put under water. Hob was sup- </p><p>posed to be pretty swift in the use of a rope. Other- </p><p>wise he was not a particularly hard citizen.—. —. —. </p><p>\X70ULDNT it be a sort of good idea </p><p> *	▼ for our magazine to have a kind of</p><p>emblem or sign or whatever you want to </p><p>call it? An ‘“Adventure, its Mark” affair? </p><p>Might use it on its stationery some day, and </p><p>there are various little purposes for which it </p><p>might come in handy.

With him as </p><p>guide and expert we can be sure that what </p><p>we collect will be assessed at its right </p><p>and full value. </p><p> Whenever any of you sends in a hitherto</p><p>unpublished chantey or sea-song or a ballad </p><p>of the Great Lakes or Erie Canal we’ll try </p><p>to have it at our Camp-Fire for the benefit </p><p>of all of us. And we hope that later on </p><p>Mr. Lomax will have enough of them to </p><p>embody in a book for still more permanent </p><p>keeping. </p><p> Of course original productions have no</p><p>place in this collodion. </p><p> Some time in the future we might try</p><p>our hand at collecting unpublished cowboy </p><p>songs and songs of the old West in general. </p><p>And perhaps the lumberjack songs some </p><p>day. </p><p> •Some of the songs are of course too broad</p><p>to be printable, but some of these have </p><p>merits that offset that point and, if you </p><p>have any of Lhe latter, no doubt Mr. Lomax </p><p>will be interesled in them. • </p><p>tpOLLOWING is a list of the published </p><p>chanteys and songs so far as accessible </p><p>in Lhe New York Public Library.

Somewhere beyond the limit of physical </p><p>vision lies the unknown, the supposedly inaccessible. </p><p>Comes curiosity. Curiosity proves too strong for </p><p>mental fear, though it may give a sharp jolt to mere </p><p>physical courage; and out goes the adventurer, </p><p>bound to satisfy his curiosity even at the cost of </p><p>his life, even though the object prove after all a </p><p>will-o’-the-wisp. The adventure lies not in the </p><p>finding, but in the seeking, while yet the goal re- </p><p>mains unseen and unknown. And the adventurer </p><p>is a great or small adventurer in the proportion </p><p>by which curiosity conquers fear. </p><p> Such is my notion of the spirit which moves so</p><p>many men to perform otherwise unaccountable </p><p>actions. I know it is so in my own case. Let some </p><p>one tell me that there is some place I can not reach, </p><p>something I can not do, and up rises All Powerful </p><p>Curiosity. What is it? Where? If foot free, </p><p>I want immediately to have a go.—A. E. Dingle. </p><p>A DAINTY morsel from Henry Oyen of </p><p>our writers’ brigade: </p><p> Just noticed in one of the recent numbers of</p><p>Adventure that there’s mention of “Liver-Eating </p><p>Johnson,” of the Yellowstone country. Did your </p><p>correspondent tell you how he got his name? Don’t </p><p>think it was because he had a weakness for “liver </p><p>and.” Far be it from such. 1 have it straight </p><p>from a man who hunted with him a few years before </p><p>he died: Johnson played king to his neck of the coun- </p><p>try, and there was only one young Indian, a Chey- </p><p>enne chief, who dared to defy him. Said chief </p><p>raided and burned Johnson’s camp once while </p><p>Johnson was away at his traps. “The-!” said </p><p>Johnson, when he returned and saw the ruins. “I’ll </p><p>eat his liver!” And, tradition saith, he made good </p><p>the threat.—Oyen. </p><p> A S PREVIOUSLY announced, ourCamp-</p><p>Fire buttons are now ready for de- </p><p>livery. I think there’s going to be no </p><p>doubt as to a big demand for them. At </p><p>this writing the first announcement of </p><p>their being ready has not reached you, </p><p>yet requests have been coming in right </p><p>along, though Uie askers had only the </p><p>vague preliminary announcements^ to go </p><p>on, without knowing price or date of de- </p><p>livery. As the buttons were delivered </p><p>to us long before we could notify you in </p><p>print we have been sending them out to </p><p>these early seekers. There will be enough </p><p>for all. Though this first order may be </p><p>exhausted before long, more will be ordered </p><p>before it entirely disappears and, now that </p><p>the die is made, re-orders will not take so </p><p>long.</p><p> The button or badge is small, neat, in-</p><p>conspicuous and yet individual and easily </p><p>seen. Enamel with gold-washed edgings, </p><p>round, three-eighths of an inch in diameter, </p><p>screw-back, with a clinch pin to hold in </p><p>place. Three fields, blue, brown and green, </p><p>for sky, earth and sea. The numeral 71 </p><p>is the only lettering or design of any kind </p><p>that appears on the badge, 71 being the </p><p>sum of the letters of “Camp-Fire” when </p><p>assigned their numerical positions in the </p><p>alphabet. </p><p> Membership in our Camp-Fire is open</p><p>to any one who has the desire to be a com- </p><p>rade. There is no ceremony of admission. </p><p>And any member may apply for a badge. </p><p>They are sent out at cost price, 25 cents </p><p>covering badge and return postage to any </p><p>part of the world. </p><p> I’m glad the badges are assured of a</p><p>strong demand. There is a good idea </p><p>back of their use and the badges themselves </p><p>will, I think, win favor when you see them. </p><p>Personally I’ll be glad when I can locate </p><p>a comrade among apparent strangers and </p><p>I think most of us feel the same way. </p><p>TN RESPONSE to a Camp-Fire sugges- </p><p>-*• tion, a number of you have written </p><p>in their own experiences in getting out of </p><p>the clutches of old Mr. Demon Rum. No </p><p>preaching, you understand; we’re not con- </p><p>ducting any temperance crusade. Just </p><p>plain facts, given on the chance they may </p><p>be of practical help to other comrades who </p><p>are trying to cut it out. Here is one </p><p>of the letters. It is our comrade E. E. </p><p>Harriman, of our writers’ brigade and “Ask </p><p>Adventure,” to whom he refers. </p><p>Pasadena, Calif. </p><p> For several years, having the restless foot, wan-</p><p>dered around the country and very naturally </p><p>picked up booze. First came malaria, then a </p><p>morning drink, which soon grew into a quart a </p><p>day. The fever was not cured, so I visited Hot </p><p>Springs, Ark., taking four months’ water cure. </p><p>It proved a success, for I have never had the fever </p><p>since, but the booze appetite remained. </p><p> For several years I hit it up pretty hard, then</p><p>tried to quit, and I guess I swore off several hundred </p><p>times only to go back again. I never reached the </p><p>“bum a drink stage,” but came very close. </p><p>T^REE years ago I decided it was either quit </p><p>or go under, for I am a lunger and have been </p><p>for twelve years, and booze was not helping me. </p><p>Knowing I could not stand the pace much longer, </p><p>I rolled my bed and struck out for Trinity County, </p><p>Calif., landing in Hyampom, a valley, not a town. </p><p> As far as the eye could reach there was nothing</p><p>but pines and mountains, valleys and streams. </p><p>The sort of country that lifts a man out of himself, </p><p>raises him to a higher plane and makes him dean </p><p>whether he wants to or not. I spent four months </p><p>in and close to Hyampom. Fishing, hunting and </p><p>hiking. 1 forgot about booze, and to thic day </p><p>I have no desire for it and do not drink even beer. </p><p>Adventure </p><p> 184</p><p> Understand me, I ant no anti-booze man, but</p><p>I have seen some fine men go under from it and </p><p>I know from experience that old John B. has a fierce </p><p>kick. He always wins if you stay long enough. </p><p>YY^HILlv on the subject let me tell you something </p><p> about the trip.</p><p> Two of us left here on Sept. 16, 1916, by auto</p><p>and, on arriving in Red Bluff, hired a truck and </p><p>driver to take us and our outfit to Hayfork, about </p><p>one hundred and fifty miles. From Hayfork to </p><p>Hyampom on foot without outfit on mule back, </p><p>about thirty miles. We walked about twenty </p><p>miles, I guess, for we rode to the end of the highway </p><p>about eight miles. </p><p> When we reached Hyampom my booze-soaked</p><p>muscles were screaming with pain. We spent the </p><p>night at a Mr. Butler's, and early the next morning </p><p>started for the summit of Hayfork Mountain where </p><p>we intended camping a few days to enjoy some real </p><p>good hunting. </p><p> Don’t think I will say much about that trip,</p><p>for I always want to go back to bed and rest when- </p><p>ever it comes into my mind. We made it all right </p><p>and after a short rest took a look at the country. </p><p>J ’LL never forget the first sunset, and you know </p><p>this country is noted for its beautiful sunsets, </p><p>of which I have seen many but nothing to equal </p><p>that one. Can you imagine hundreds of miles </p><p>of country standing on end, thickly covered with </p><p>pine trees and every known color and shade and </p><p>many unknown covering the whole thing? Can </p><p>you imagine the west a blaze of color and the east </p><p>tinted yellow with a great big moon? Well, that </p><p>is what I saw, only it don't come anywhere near </p><p>telling you of the wonderful beauty. </p><p> I tell you, a man couldn't be anything but clean</p><p>in this country. </p><p>KJEVER saw so many deer in my life, or such </p><p>streams of fish. Rainbow, steel-head and </p><p>salmon trout. Quail and grouse are positively </p><p>thick. Believe me, it’s a man’s country. I am </p><p>crazy to go back, but can’t get enough money </p><p>together. I work two or three months, then have </p><p>to rest the same length of time. Some day I hope </p><p>to collect the correct amount and, believe me, I will </p><p>hike for Trinity, locate a homestead and Live. </p><p> If you care to use this, hop to it, only please</p><p>don’t use my name. </p><p>jDY THE way, to come Jback lo the booze ques-</p><p>tion. Tell any chap who wants to quit to go </p><p>see Mr. Harriman. Just to look at him will make </p><p>anything on two legs straighten his shoulders and </p><p>take a brace. He sure is a man's man, and then </p><p>some. He is aU man. </p><p> If any one ever asks anything about Trinity</p><p>County let me know. I sure will boost. </p><p> Excuse me for taking up so much of your time,</p><p>but thoughts of Trinity send me back to the trails </p><p>I dearly love.---. </p><p>*	I 'HE Federal Board for Vocational Edu-</p><p>cation, 200 New Jersey Avenue, North- </p><p>west, Washington, D. C., sent us a state- </p><p>ment of the many practical helps and </p><p>services they offer in reeducating disabled </p><p>soldiers and sailors but there is not spat • </p><p>to print them all, concisely stated though </p><p>they are. Artificial limbs free, free medical </p><p>treatment after discharge (for disability </p><p>incurred in service), free vocational training </p><p>with War-Risk insuranc^provision cover- </p><p>ing period of training and period of further </p><p>disability, help toward suitable positions </p><p>following training, etc. Fourteen district </p><p>offices through the country. </p><p> If you were disabled in service make sure</p><p>that you know definitely and in full all </p><p>the many things the Board will do to help </p><p>you. Personally I was amazed at the </p><p>extent of the service offered. But all that </p><p>service was fully and honestly earned by </p><p>those in need of it and it would be only </p><p>childish and wrong lo refuse the service </p><p>because of any mistaken pride. You might </p><p>just as well refuse the ‘ charity” of a decora- </p><p>tion for valor. </p><p>'"THE adventures of our identificAtion- </p><p> -*• cards in the Great War—if collected</p><p>what a book they would make!

A., over to the camps of Blighty and </p><p>the wastes of Franee, where its bearer has during the </p><p>past two years alternated between laying rails for </p><p>France, iindcr General “Jack" Stewart, and dodging </p><p>“Jerry’s’’ shrapnel, bombs, “flying pigs," and many </p><p>of the other pleasant surprises "Jerry’’ entertains </p><p>our boys with. </p><p> Your card was present at the Battle of Vimy, April</p><p> 1917, at the Cambrai push of November, 1917, in the</p><p> big retreat of March, 1918, and between times was</p><p> all over the place in the terrain bounded by Arras,</p><p> Cambrai, Peronne, Amiens, Paris. Abbeville and the</p><p> Channel coast. Quite a big territory to cover, em-</p><p> bracing nearly all of the ancient domains of Picardy</p><p> and Artois. “Somme” battlefield it was! Never</p><p> have Dumas romances seemed so real as when I</p><p> saw Bcthune, Le Fdre, Beauvais, etc., etc. ad. lib.—</p><p> No. 749285 Sapper Roger F. Gardener, 12th</p><p> Canadian Railway Troops.</p><p>OOMETHING for us to be considering. </p><p>^ Wouldn’t it be a fine thing if we could </p><p>gradually establish Camp-Fire "stations" </p><p>or local headquarters all over the map? </p><p>A place where we could register ourselves </p><p>or leave word for a comrade who would </p><p>or might follow later, or run a good chance </p><p>Looking Ahead </p><p>of meeting other wandering or resident </p><p>comrades? </p><p>Nothing pretentious. Just a “station,” </p><p>which might be in a tobacco-shop or any </p><p>old place that was reputable. Bar-rooms </p><p>and such barred. (Oh, yes, I know the </p><p>objections to barring them, but this matter </p><p>for Democracy	185</p><p>has to be considered from the general aspect </p><p>and there are sound reasons for not making </p><p>bar-rooms our permanent and “official” </p><p>homes.) </p><p>How about it? Yes or no? If yes, what </p><p>suggestions? </p><p>—Arthur Sullivant Hoffman. </p><p>LOOKING </p><p>AHEAD </p><p>FOR </p><p>DEMOCRACY </p><p>J£Y THE time this readies you in print we shall </p><p>know the result of the call for action on June </p><p>twenty-fifth. I do not expect that the world will </p><p>be set on fire, but T do hope that here and there </p><p>some seeds will be sown, some publidty given to </p><p>the needed work and enough workers enlisted to </p><p>form the nucleus of an organization that itself is </p><p>built on democratic lines. </p><p> A choice had to be made. First, organize by the</p><p>usual method with the usual backing from men with </p><p>money and the usual control by a few men at the </p><p>head. It is the easier method and far more likely </p><p>to succeed than the second, but it would lie trying </p><p>to further real democracy by an organization that </p><p>is itself an autocracy. So the second mediod was </p><p>chosen, despite the fact that it is almost impossible </p><p>to make much headway at first by means of it. At </p><p>least it does not betray democracy from the start. </p><p>And in the long run it will be of more avail. </p><p> The movement must be from the people them-</p><p>selves, of them, by them, at all times under their </p><p>control. Better a small right one than a big wrong </p><p>one. </p><p>gINCE this is being written in the middle of </p><p>May, there can be no guessing whether the </p><p>response to the call will be very small or fairly con- </p><p>siderable. But there is always the fact that even a </p><p>few seeds sown will be working—in ways no man </p><p>can measure—the right leaven into the national fer- </p><p>ment. Sooner or later enough of the people to be </p><p>effective will see the need and take hold. </p><p> So far as I personally am concerned, I have done</p><p>what little I could in the way that seemed soundest </p><p>and there is nothing more that I can do except con- </p><p>tinue preaching and working in a small way. Little </p><p>enough, but 1 am only one American. You are </p><p>another. There are many millions of us. It is no </p><p>more my work than it is yours or any other Ameri- </p><p>can’s. It lies with you fully as much as with any- </p><p>body else. </p><p>TUST what shape this department will take from </p><p>J now on 1 do not know. Many interesting let- </p><p>ters have come in, proving the seriousness witli </p><p>which many Americans are considering the road </p><p>ahead of this people. Perhaps we can make the </p><p>department a torum. You will remember that it </p><p>was started as a forum but, the war being not yet </p><p>over, there were not enough who saw the coming </p><p>problems of peace to keep it going. Now it is dif- </p><p>ferent. The future has become the present. The </p><p>difficulty would be in selecting, from so many opin- </p><p>ions on so many subjects, letters for print m such </p><p>way that balance and fair hearing could be main- </p><p>tained in our small space. </p><p> The department will have to be worked out as it</p><p>goes along.—A.

And of animals, lion </p><p>in plenty, rhinoceros, 'buffalo, elephant and </p><p>leopard. </p><p> White men there do only boss jobs; all other</p><p>work is done by natives, Indians or Goanese (a </p><p>half-breed from the island of Goa, India). So, for </p><p>the answer to Lhe last question, I am sorry that </p><p>I can not encourage you to go there until you have </p><p>a profession or trade—and then such profession or </p><p>trade would be limited to a few, such as rubber </p><p>planting, fiber, or as agent for some commercial </p><p>firm; and then you would have little opportunity </p><p>for adventure or shooting. Native trading is no </p><p>good now as the Indians compete against the white </p><p>man. </p><p>The Sunken Lands of Arkansas </p><p>DID you know the Mississippi once ran </p><p>up-stream? Or that the famous, re- </p><p>cently reclaimed farming land in the </p><p>sunken country of Northeastern Arkansas </p><p>was the result of a great earthquake, still </p><p>remembered by oldest inhabitants? You </p><p>may want to take a fishing or hunting trip </p><p>there-; or even to buy a farm in this super- </p><p>fertile section: </p><p> Question:—'‘Please give me some information</p><p>regarding Big Lake, Arkansas. Is it a Govt, </p><p>game preserve? Can one fish there? </p><p> “Also, what and where are the sunken lands of</p><p>Missouri and Arkansas? Is there good farming </p><p>land there? Has the land been reclaimed?"— </p><p>F. R. Sptegielle, Charles City, Iowa. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Thompson:—There are sunken</p><p>lands in both Southeast Missouri and Northern</p><p>Arkansas. The greatest Missouri tract is in the </p><p>overflow formed by Cane Creek and Little Black </p><p>River. Those best known to the writer are in </p><p>Mississippi County, Arkansas. </p><p> Big Lake, Arkansas, is a Government preserve.</p><p>You can fish there, but commercial fishing is under </p><p>control of the Government. It is formed by the </p><p>widening of Little River and was for many years </p><p>the source of much rivalry between clubs and </p><p>market hunters, and was the largest shipping </p><p>section for wild ducks in the U. S. </p><p> The sunken lands commence a little below Cape</p><p>Girardeau. Missouri, and extend into most of north- </p><p>eastern Arkansas. The present conditions were </p><p>created by the earthquake of 1813 when the land </p><p>sunk and earthquakes were felt at intervals for </p><p>almost a year. Audubon, the naturalist, made </p><p>considerable note of it. For a short time the </p><p>Mississippi River ran up-stream. Until drainage </p><p>ensued, creating the most fertile farming area on </p><p>the globe, it was a wilderness of swamp and of </p><p>veritable fish and game paradise. Similar con- </p><p>ditions prevailed in southern Tennessee, and Reel- </p><p>foot Lake is a result of the earthquake. </p><p> For years it supported a population of market</p><p>hunters, fishermen and trappers. These were </p><p>recently forced to other pursuits when inundated </p><p>lands were redeemed. </p><p>I89 </p><p>Rifles and Six-Guns </p><p>PERHAPS the rifle won the West, per- </p><p>haps the six-gun. Then again, both </p><p>may have lent a hand. Anyhow, here is </p><p>a lot of interesting comment by two men </p><p>who know what they’re talking about: </p><p> Question:—"Just to get in on this gun chatter,</p><p>let me say that I learned to use a gun at the tender </p><p>age of 8, in the big timber of Minnesota. The </p><p>first time that I ever fired a gun was away prior </p><p>to that time, however. My mother, sister and </p><p>three brothers had allowed me to visit the sugar </p><p>camp with them. On the way to camp my oldest </p><p>brother shot a ruffled grouse—partridge, we called </p><p>them. </p><p> He reloaded the single-barreled Harper's Ferry</p><p>smoothbore, set it against the log cabin, and began </p><p>to gather sap. .All the rest moved off. I tackled </p><p>the gun, got it over a small log, braced my belly </p><p>against the butt, locked both middle fingers over </p><p>the trigger and—gosh, how quick I sat down! </p><p>I had to set the butt on the ground and cock the </p><p>gun by pushing down with both hands, but I had </p><p>done it. </p><p> I scared the women folks crazy, got a shaking</p><p>from Frank, my senior, had a sore spot on my front </p><p>elevation, but, Lordy, how big I felt! </p><p> I have, hunted with Mississippi Yaegers, Ken-</p><p>tucky squirrel rifles, the old Harper’s Ferry gun</p><p>(for years), with paper cartridge Sharps that </p><p>carried an ounce round ball, with Belgian muskets, </p><p>with Ballards, Colts, Wessons, Henry, Spencer, </p><p>L. C. Smith shotgun, with Winchesters. As I </p><p>write three Winchesters hang above me on the wall, </p><p>.22 special, .32-.40, and a .45-.70 meat-getter, as </p><p>Harry Knibbs calls it. </p><p> Having had a half century of gun experience</p><p>I claim to be there to a certain extent, with knowl- </p><p>edge of weapons and 1 smiled with a sincere pleasure </p><p>when I read what Chas. Beadle said in the February </p><p>3rd issue. A .45 automatic will kick itself up if </p><p>hred rapidly till it shoots far above the target. </p><p>I have tried them out on the Beverly Hill Gun </p><p>Club range and have had numerous others try </p><p>them while I watched. There arc few men who </p><p>can hold one down to its work and rattle off the </p><p>shots at the same speed that a fair gunman with </p><p>a good old six-gun S. A. when spotting his bull </p><p>every crack. </p><p> I have seen a man who had used an automatic</p><p>for a year try both on a 25-yard target and his </p><p>score, rapid fire, was 50 per cent, better with the </p><p>old gun. Then one of the boys who had an auto- </p><p>matic and boasted of its excellence, tried six shots </p><p>at speed and his last shot went out at about 15 </p><p>degrees above the target, each shot kicking it </p><p>higher. He simply could not hold it down. </p><p> I own two D. A. six-guns, but I always use</p><p>them as S. A. weapons. In case some guy bats </p><p>me over the head and climbs my frame, I may use </p><p>the self-cocking device to save his feelings, but not </p><p>otherwise. I agree with Chester, but here is a </p><p>point for the novice who wants to learn. Get to </p><p>know' the feel and hang of your gun just as a me- </p><p>chanic learns a tool. A good carpenter ran drive </p><p>a nail straight while he looks away from it. If </p><p>you know' your gun right it flips on the bull as it </p><p>comes from the holster, at any short range, in- </p><p>stinctively. </p><p>190 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> lake ihe empty gun in the privacy of your own</p><p> room and practise drawing and throwing down on</p><p> objects, also swinging directly on the bull from</p><p> the holster, without any extra motion. I never</p><p> throw down but shoot on the rise. To prove that</p><p> 1 understood throwing down 1 have dipped both</p><p> top and bottom of a 3-inch bull and centered it</p><p> with the third shot, rapid fire, throwing down</p><p> with a 44, but I Like my own style better. 1 lose</p><p> no motion.</p><p> My experience with the .32-.20 S. &amp; W.:</p><p>I once drilled a jack rabbit through the head at </p><p>S3 yards, only to have him go on slowly hopping </p><p>in a dazed fashion till I caught him. Never upset </p><p>him. Yet it tears a thundering hole when the soft </p><p>nose touches a bone in a bigger animal. But my</p><p>good old Colts .45 is the burglar annihilator, ele- </p><p>phant gun, whale-killer. </p><p> Ihe S. &amp; W. .44-.40 will do the work, too</p><p>and do it up brown. One I had not long ago used </p><p>up a 600-pound grizzly in three shots, whidi isn’t </p><p>so darned bad after all. </p><p> The .32-.20 may be what old Vincent, up in</p><p>our mountains here, calls “A - pea shooter,” </p><p>but it is such a beauty and such a performer on </p><p>the range and at small game that I love it. 11 will </p><p>stay with me till I croak, and then my grandson </p><p>gets it if he can shoot right. </p><p> In the argument concerning which gun opened</p><p>up the West, I say the rifle. The six-gun was the </p><p>scrapper's gun, the gun for brawls and murders </p><p>and for most of the arrests by officers, but the rifle </p><p>did the bulk of the real work in making buck </p><p>Injuns absent and varmints scary. Let the ultra- </p><p>modern hoot at the Winchester and praise his Ross </p><p>or his Newton, but the .45-.70 or .45-.90 cleared </p><p>a wide swath down which decent men could walk </p><p>safely. </p><p> In the Russo-Turkish war there were many</p><p>Russians killed at over two miles range by dropping </p><p>fire from .45-.90 Winchesters. A gun that </p><p>will do that is no slouch of a cannon. Remember </p><p>what the mine superintendent said in the Led </p><p>Horse Claim—“A Winchester is a mighty com- </p><p>prehensive weapon,” and many a pioneer thanked </p><p>his gods that it was so when he was up against </p><p>*red or white outlaws. Many such have found </p><p>the rifle a better weapon, properly handled, than </p><p>a six-gun.”—E. E. Harriaian, Los Angeles, Calif. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Wiggins:—Mr. Harri man’s</p><p>experience with automatics seems to be similar to </p><p>many others of which I know. I think the revolver </p><p>at high speed lines up more naturally and accurately </p><p>than the automatic. The double action is beyond </p><p>all doubt quicker than the single action. I con- </p><p>sider either one preferable to an automatic for </p><p>serious work. </p><p> A good shot will draw a revolver and hit a can</p><p> from three to six shots when the can is thrown in the</p><p> air, the revolver being drawn after it was thrown.</p><p> Also the revolver, caliber for caliber, seems to have</p><p> more killing effect than the automatic, due to the</p><p> soft lead bullet of the revolver expanding slightly.</p><p> I have never known of an instance where the</p><p>bullet from a .45 Colt failed to knock a man off </p><p>his feet. I do not think’the .32- .20 is the equal </p><p>of the .38 special for stopping power. </p><p> There is no doubt that the rifle killed off most of</p><p> the bad characters, but I think the credit should</p><p> go to Col. Colt for origination of the multi-shot</p><p> weapon I recollect an instance of a horse thief</p><p> being killed wjth a 45 Colt at a distance of L'60</p><p>yards. Short range weapon, eh? </p><p>British Honduras</p><p> A PPARENTLY it’s up to some venture-</p><p>some soul to penetrate the jungles </p><p>and ranges of this little known land and </p><p>find out what it's like. The natives won’t. </p><p>They’re too lazy. Anyhow, there is always </p><p>a strange, compelling fascination about an </p><p>unexplored country. Therefore we give </p><p>you the following: _ </p><p> Question:—“Can you give me some general</p><p>information about British Honduras? 1 am espe- </p><p>cially interested in the chances for placer mining </p><p> there.</p><p> What is its topography, chief industry, and</p><p>population? What sort of natives might one </p><p>expect Lo find? </p><p> Has the interior been explored? What arc its</p><p>imports?”—L. S. D., Tensacola, Fla. </p><p>Answer, by Mr. Young:—Area 19,585 kilometers. </p><p> Population 37,000.</p><p>Capital, Beliz, or Bclice, population 4,000. </p><p> Exports: a little mahogany, rubber, fruits and</p><p> hides.</p><p> Imports: small quantities of cotton fabrics, flour,</p><p> implements, etc., principally from the U. S. A.</p><p> Geography: Low lying, for the most part, with</p><p> a few hills known as die Cockscombs Mountain^</p><p> forming the highest elevations. A view from the</p><p> top of Victoria Mt. to the east shows at close</p><p> hand a number of thickly wooded hills about three</p><p> hundred feet high and dropping abruptly to a</p><p> flat, swampy, tropical jungle, marked here and</p><p> there with sluggish rivers and streams. Beyond</p><p> and beyond would be the coast and a chain</p><p> of islands paralleling it. No human being could</p><p> ever see tins far in British Honduras, for a clear</p><p> day is a rare thing, due to the excessive rainfall</p><p> at all seasons. The actual temperature is not high,</p><p> ranging from 26 to 30 centigrade, but on account</p><p> of the humidity it is very oppressive and quickly</p><p> saps the vitality. It is possibly for this reason</p><p> that the inhabitants of British Honduras are easily</p><p> the laziest of all Central America.</p><p> y There are very few white people in British</p><p> Honduras. The bulk of the population is negro</p><p> and mulatto who speak a poor kind of English</p><p> which puzzles a newcomer, a few pure Carib</p><p> Indians, mixed Carib-Ncgro breeds, and Spanish-</p><p> Indian or Spanish-Negro mixtures. The entire</p><p> colony is sparsely settled and is distributed as</p><p> follows: District of Beliz, 5,000; Corozal, 1,804;</p><p> Orange Walk, 3,700; Stann Creek, 5,166; Toledo,</p><p> 2,400; and Cayo, 2,000.</p><p> Very Utile is known of the interior of this country.</p><p> As small as it is the people are too lazy to go back</p><p> into it and see what it is like. They are content</p><p> to roll around in filth and idleness and Uve prin-</p><p> cipaUy on fish and the natural fruits and nuts of</p><p> the near-by jungles. The British government</p><p> keeps a few negro soldiers from Jamaica stationed</p><p> at various points to preserve order. The colony</p><p> is ruled by a governor, assisted by a congress of ten</p><p>Lost </p><p>members. The negroes of the colony are allowed </p><p>to elect a queen, which they do with great pomp. </p><p> The natives along the coast barter back and forth</p><p>among themselves, each coast town having a flotilla </p><p>of canoes tied in front of it, and quite a bit of turtle </p><p>shell is sold to local traders who export it to this </p><p>country. In the hill country com, rice, manioc </p><p>(from which tapioca is made), cotton, aloe, coffee, </p><p>cacao (chocolate), oranges, bananas, rubber, </p><p>pepper, and many other products thrive easily. </p><p>The price of land (government Crown land) is nom- </p><p>inally fixed at five dollars a hectare (over two acres). </p><p> Traces of gold, silver and lead have been found</p><p>in some of the creeks of this country, but nothing </p><p>of any note. The formation of the Cockscombs </p><p>is a hard granite with quartz veins cropping out </p><p>in places. Hunting placer ground is a rather tedious </p><p>process, due to the heavy growth of jungle. </p><p> The lowland was once sea-bottom and was doubt-</p><p>less built up to its present level by coral growth. </p><p>There have been a few small placer operations </p><p>at various points in the colony but I have never </p><p>heard of one that amounted to much. For my </p><p>part T would not suggest British Honduras if you </p><p>are thinking of trying to locate placer ground or </p><p>dredging ground. However, it will only cost you </p><p>a §5 tax to try it out. That is what the govern- </p><p>ment charges for prospecting license. And if you </p><p>find anything you must declare it immediately, </p><p>have it surveyed by a government surveyor and pay </p><p>royalty on each ounce mined. </p><p> The laws of Spanish Honduras are much more</p><p>liberal. Spanish and not British Honduras would </p><p>be my suggestion for prospecting. Several of </p><p>my answers regarding this country have been </p><p>printed in Adventure Magazine during the past </p><p>two years. Write to The Pan-American Union, </p><p>Washington, D. C., for the booklet “Honduras— </p><p>general descriptive data” for general information. </p><p>Also write Department of Commerce, Latin- </p><p>American Division, Washington, D. C., for supple- </p><p>ments to commerce reports covering Spanish </p><p>Honduras. </p><p>Trails	191</p><p>The Original Seven Seas </p><p> PERHAPS some of you may have still</p><p> a different explanation of the origin</p><p> of the term “Seven Seas.” Here are two.</p><p> Though no fixed definition can be found,</p><p> anyone is entitled to his own theory:</p><p> Question:—“Be so good as to inform me what the</p><p> expression the ‘Seven Seas’ signifies?</p><p> What seven seas are meant? How and when did</p><p> the term originate?”—Geo. M. Klein, Vicksburg,</p><p> Mississippi.	, •</p><p> Atirwer, by Captain Dingle-—The term Seven</p><p> Seas is hard to trace to its absolute source. There</p><p> are almost as many definitions, and dales of origin,</p><p> as there are waves on those Seven Seas. One of the</p><p> most general suppositions is that the term embraces</p><p> the Five Oceans and the Carribbean and Medi-</p><p> teranean Seas, which in bygone days were seas of</p><p> distinct trades. For example, ships plied the great</p><p> oceans on distant voyages or exploring cruises,</p><p> while the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas were</p><p> sufficiently well known to have established firms</p><p> trading to them with their vessels, the Levanters</p><p> and West Indiamen.</p><p> There was another selection of Seas which many</p><p> understood to be the Seven, but the reason is not</p><p> very bright unless one remembers that sailors in</p><p> days before steam made some very eventful voyages</p><p> in remote regions, and were apt to recall such voy-</p><p> ages by events that affected their ship—such as</p><p> pirates in the China Seas, savages in the South Seas,</p><p> slavers in the Arabian Sea, etc. These other Seven</p><p> Seas were the Mediterranean, Caribbean, Baltic,</p><p> Arabian, North, China, and South Seas.</p><p> Personally, although the evidence is not so dear</p><p> to a landsman, I lean to the latter explanation.</p><p> But there is not a fixed definition to be found, that</p><p> I have even discovered, so it remains after all greatly</p><p> a matter of opinion if not guesswork.</p><p>LOST TRAILS </p><p> Note—We offer this department of the "Camp-Fire" free of charge to those</p><p>of our readers who wish to get in touch again with old friends or acquaintances </p><p>from whom the years have separated them.
