For a while they leaned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rail, staring down at the dense crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had thronged the airport to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure of the Viking. In this warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather the men wore only light shorts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gayly colored shirts. The women wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long dresses and metal caps and thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauze veils that were so popular that year.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Around the fringes of the airport stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ramparts of New York's many tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings, with the four hundred story</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk of the Federal Building a giant metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger against the midnight sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When are we going to pull out, Chief?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve Brent asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As soon as the ship from Mars gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and Olga Stark can come aboard."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Funny thing--I've never been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that gal!" Steve said.

He yawned, and changed the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject. "Y'know--I've just been wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">what really did happen to the Stardust!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry shrugged without replying. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a question that was bound to be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minds of all members of this expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, whether or not they put it in words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Travel between Earth and Mars had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">commonplace for more than a generation</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, but there had not yet been any com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">munication with Venus--that cloud-veiled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">planet whose orbit lay nearer the sun than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of earth. Two years ago the explor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ship Stardust had started for Venus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had simply vanished into the cold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer space--and never been heard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GERRY NORTON thought the Viking</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get through. Science had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">some advances in these past two years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His ship would carry better rocket fuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">than had the Stardust, and more efficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity plates. The new duralite hull had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strength to withstand a terrific impact.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would probably get through. If not</seg><seg type="columnLine">--well--he had been taking chances all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. You didn't go into the Interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Service at all if you were afraid of danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There comes the ship from Mars now!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve Brent said, suddenly pointing up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A streak of fire like a shooting star had</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in the sky far above. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocket blast of the incoming space</seg><seg type="columnLine">liner. Yellow flames played about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow as she turned on the reverse rockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reduce the terrific speed. The roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discharge came down through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a faint rumble of distant surf. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rockets ceased, and the ship began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop down as the helicopters were unfolded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take the weight and lower her easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't be long now!" Steve said in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his low, deep, quiet voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, not long!" boomed a deep voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them, "but I'm thinking it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long day before we return to this braw</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet of ours!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angus McTavish, chief engineer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Viking, was a giant of a man with a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could be heard above the roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket motors when he chose to raise it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a pair of very bright blue eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and a luxuriant red beard. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably no more than a dozen full sets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskers worn in the earth in this day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and age, and McTavish laid claim to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most imposing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fuel all aboard, Chief," he said, "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tender's cast off and we're ready to ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever you give the word."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just as soon as these people come</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me, Mac," Steve Brent interposed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now that we're all about to jump off into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unknown--just why do you sport that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crop of whiskers?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I won't have to button my collar, ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">feckless loon!" the big engineer replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Scots are a queer race."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, lad--the salt o' the earth.

Why, they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">more fuss about one of their funny old</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged air-ships flying the Atlantic than we</seg><seg type="columnLine">do about a voyage to Mars or the Moon."</seg><seg type="columnLine">• The ship from Mars settled gently down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the concrete landing platform, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">helicopters ceased to turn. From a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred nozzles along the edge of the platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">came hissing streams of water, playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the hull that had been heated by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift passage through the outer layers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earth's atmosphere. Then, as the hull</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooled, the streams of water died away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the doors opened. The passengers be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to emerge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A platoon of police, their steel helmets</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming in the glow of the lights, cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">a path through the crowd for a small group</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hurried across to the waiting Viking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few minutes later three newcomers came</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard. All wore the blue and gold uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of the Interplanetary Fleet. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were Martians, thin and sharp fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured, with the reddish skin of their race.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other was an Earth woman. Olga</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stark stood nearly as tall as Gerry Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's own six feet. She had a pale skin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a mass of dark hair that was coiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">low on her ncck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pilot-Lieutenant Stark and Flight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ensigns Tanda and Portok reporting</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard, sir," she said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll find the officers' quarters aft on</seg><seg type="columnLine">B-deck. I'm calling a conference in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chart room as soon as we get clear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stratosphere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GERRY NORTON stood on the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform at the top of the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, under a curved dome of transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">duralite that gave him a clear view along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole length of the Viking's super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure. The last member of the expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition was aboard, the airport attendants</seg><seg type="columnLine">had all stepped back. The time of depar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture had come at last!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Close all ports!" he snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Close ports it is, sir," droned Chester</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sand, the Safety Officer. Warning bells</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang throughout the ship. Tiny green</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights came winking into view on one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">many indicator panels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All ports closed, sir!" the Safety Offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cer sang out a minute later. For a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment Gerry bent over the rail of the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form and himself glanced down at the solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank of green lights on the board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Start helicopters!" he ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a low humming. The ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to vibrate gently. From his place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dome, Gerry could see the Viking's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen big helicopters begin to spin. Faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">and faster they moved as Angus McTavish</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave his engines full power. Then the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose straight up into the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here we go, boys--Venus or bust!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve Brent muttered under his breath, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low chuckle swept across the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lighted surface of the airport fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly away beneath them. The myriad</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights of New York were spread out like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jeweled carpet in the night, dwindling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seeming to slide together as the drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Viking's powerful motors carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">her steadily upward. At the three thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand-foot level they passed a traffic bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loon with its circle of blue lights, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal blinker spelled out a hasty "Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luck!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT the thirty thousand-foot level they</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed an inbound Oriental &amp; West-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern liner, bringing the night mail from</seg><seg type="columnLine">6	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">China. She hung motionless on her heli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">copters to let the Viking pass, her siren</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving a salute of three long blasts while</seg><seg type="columnLine">her passengers crowded the decks to cheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spacc-ship. After another ten thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet they were above ordinary traffic lanes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The glass windows of the control room</seg><seg type="columnLine">were beginning to show a film of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">densing moisture, and Steve Brent brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy duralite panes up into place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand by rocket motors!" Gerry com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded. "Stand by to fold helicopters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ready? Contact!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a muffled roar. The Viking's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose tilted sharply upward. Momentarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space-ship trembled like a living thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she shot ahead, while the helicopters</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped down into recesses within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull and duralite covers slid into place over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Gerry climbed down from the dome</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the main control room. Momentarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie glanced at the huge brass and steel speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twelve hundred miles an hour," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.

Now that the trip had actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun, uniform coats were unbuttoned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caps laid aside. Angus McTavish had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered brier pipe clenched in his teeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stem was so short that the swirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke seemed to filter upward through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his whiskers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better be careful, Mac," said Portok</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian. "Maybe the air filters won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to handle that smoke of yours."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Never mind the air filters, sonny!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted the big Scot with imperturbable</seg><seg type="columnLine">good humor.

The Viking was going on the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous journey mankind had ever at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted, a journey from which no one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever before returned alive, but he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have asked for a better group of sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinates. They were people of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">choosing, and all but two were old ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mates. Though he had never sailed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chester Sand, the Safety Officer had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly recommended. Neither had he ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed with Olga Stark before, but he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">her by reputation as an excellent navigator</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when she applied to go he felt he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should accept her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR half an hour Gerry held them to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, while he set the watches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked assignments and outlined other</seg><seg type="columnLine">routine details. Then the meeting ended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only Steve Brent remained with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They walked forward into the darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">control room, where the only light was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim glow from the indicator boards. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quartermaster on watch stood motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the steering levers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerjy noticed that he had a tendency to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise a couple of inches off the floor with</seg><seg type="columnLine">each step. The pull of Earth was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessening! He threw the switch that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled the attraction-gear, and heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint hiss of shifting gravity plates beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet. The feeling and impression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal weight returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Gerry and Steve stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking out one of the big duralite win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows of the control room. At this level</seg><seg type="columnLine">the legions of stars gleamed with an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">real brilliance in the dead black of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens. The Earth was a vast globe be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind them, glowing for a quarter of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface with the familiar outlines of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">continents still visible. With the lessen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pull, the Viking had increased speed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">five thousand, but she seemed to be stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing still in comparison with the vastness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny thing, Chief," Steve Brent said</seg><seg type="columnLine">meditatively, "Olga Stark and Chester</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sand are not supposed to have met before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came aboard this ship--but I saw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering together in that dark corner off</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corridor 6 as I came forward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe she's just a fast worker," Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. For a moment the incident irritated</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but then he shrugged and forgot it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On a purely scientific and exploratory ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedition of this kind, there was no possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive for any underhand work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE days passed in slow progression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Viking had attained her maximum</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of fifty thousand miles an hour as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ceaseless drive of her great rocket mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors forced her ahead, a speed possible in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the void of outer space where there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no air to create friction. For all her great</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed by Earthly standards, she was but</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling slowly across the vastness of In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terplanetary space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Life on board had settled down to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth routine. Now and then alarm bells</seg><seg type="columnLine">would suddenly ring a warning of the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach of a small planetesimal or some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other vagrant w'anderer of outer space, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship would change course to avoid a</seg><seg type="columnLine">collision. Otherwise there was little ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement. Astern, the familiar Earth had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwindled to a shining disc--like the but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton on an airman's uniform. Ahead, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud-veiled planet of Venus drew steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Passing along one of B-deck corridors</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day, Gerry met Olga Stark coming out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the recreation rooms. She was oft' duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the moment, and instead of her uniform</seg><seg type="columnLine">she wore a long gown of green silk. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark hair was surmounted by a polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal cap, and a thin gauze veil hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her chin. Gerry stopped her with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very dccorative, Lieutenant," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a twitch of his lips, "but this is sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to be a scientific expedition. I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask that you wear your uniform outside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your cabin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am off duty!" she retorted, her dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes suddenly angry and sullen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's true that you're not on watch at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this moment, but everybody is on duty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-four hours a day till this expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is over. Resume your uniform."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if I refuse?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll go into double irons. When I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanding a ship, I do just that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment their glances met, the wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's hot and angry, the man's cold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unyielding. Then, without another word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she swept away to her cabin. Gerry Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton sighed, and went on his way. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never become entirely reconciled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of women in the Interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fleet. They made good officers most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, but occasionally they had fits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feminine temperament.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT last there came the day when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellowish, cloud-veiled mass of Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled half the sky ahead. Watches were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled up. Rocket motors were cut down</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the attraction of the planet pulled them</seg><seg type="columnLine">onward. Then the forward rocket-tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to let go for the braking effect, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flame of the discharges filled the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol room with a flickering yellow light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they entered the outer atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">layers of Venus, the effect of air on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's rays gave them natural sunlight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue skies again for the first time in over</seg><seg type="columnLine">six weeks. Something about the effect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow sunlight slanting in the port-holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised the spirits of all of them, and men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were whistling as they went about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Gerry brought the ship to a halt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few thousand feet above the endless, tum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled mass of clouds that eternally cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered all of Venus. They were now near</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to be fully caught in the rotation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet's stratosphere, so that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had normal night and day instead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eternal midnight that had gripped them for</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Early the next morning, with all hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on duty, the Viking's helicopters began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop her down into the cloud-mass. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottony billows swept up to meet them--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then they were submerged in a dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yellowish fog. Moisture gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly on the windows of the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This reminds me of a good London</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog!" said Angus McTavish, who had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from his engine rooms for a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes. "I wonder if they have any good</seg><seg type="columnLine">pubs down there!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">8	PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The soupy, saffron-colored fog en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrouded the Viking as she dropped lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lower. Gerry Norton checked the alti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude personally, watching the slowly mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hand of the indicator. Twice he held</seg><seg type="columnLine">her motionless while he sent echo-sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings down to make sure they were not too</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to land. Then they went a little lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and suddenly came clear of the cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass. They were sinking slowly down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward through a peculiarly murky, golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that was the normal day-time condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on the planet of Venus. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Below them stretched the rippling waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a vast and greenish sea. It was broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">by scattered islands, bare bits of rock that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dotted with a blue moss and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly bare of life except for a few swoop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sea-birds. On a distant shore were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lofty mountains whose peaks were capped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with snow. In one or two places a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft of sunlight struck down through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief gap in the canopy of eternal clouds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but otherwise there was only that sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dued and peculiarly golden light. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved but those few oddly shaped birds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord--but it's lonely!" Gerry mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no sign of human existence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no trace of the towers and buildings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind. Not even any sign of life at all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for those sea-birds. It was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene from the long-ago youth of the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the only life was that of the teeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallows or the muddy shores of warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas. The place was desolate, and forlorn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inexpressibly lonely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had opened some of the ports for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a breath of fresh air after long weeks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flat and second-hand product of the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">filters, with its faint odor of oil and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">infectant. The breeze that came in the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports was warm and moist and faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">salty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rocket motors -- minimum power!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry commanded quietly. "There's no use</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing on one of those bare islets. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what lies beyond the mountains."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The subdued blast of only two rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes began to drive the Viking forward at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slow speed of about 300 M.P.H., while</seg><seg type="columnLine">long fins were thrust out at the sides to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry the weight and free the helicopters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All hands were crowded at the windows</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and ports. After a moment Olga Stark</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Gerry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our magnetic compasses are working</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, Captain," she said quietly. "I sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gest going across the mountains and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning southwest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why there--rather than in any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction?" Gerry asked quietly. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a hunch. Of course, it's all guess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Viking had to go up to a level of</seg><seg type="columnLine">18,000 feet above this lonely Venusian sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">before she was above the peaks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains. Then Gerry turned her in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. Just before they left the shore-line</seg><seg type="columnLine">they passed some sort of a flying thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that swooped down to prey on the sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds. It had a reptilian body, and a spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">of leathery wings about twelve feet across.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you look at that!" Steve Brent</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd hate to meet that on a dark night!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry said grimly. Along the shore-line</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they flashed inland he could see mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous, crawling things that moved slug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gishly along the beaches or in the shallows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It began to seem that life on Venus was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different level than that of the Outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Viking drove steadily westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the mountains. From the lower con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol room windows Gerry could see only</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted snow and naked boulders, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauntly lonely peaks. The air was thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cold. The canopy of yellow clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a little way above them. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the mountains at last, they dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down toward a broad table-land covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with patches of forest and alternate</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretches of open grass-land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cut rockets!" Gerry snapped. "Pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pare to land!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later the Viking settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently down in a broad clearing, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarse grass was knee high. For the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in over six weeks the sound and vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the motors ceased. The expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">had landed on Venus!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE landing party filed out a door that</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened in the lower part of the hull.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The moist air was a little warmer than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Earth, and it had an unfamiliar smell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of growing things, but its density seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">about the same. Since the size of Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was similar to that of their own planets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither Earth-man nor Martian had much</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble in walking as soon as they became</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to a slightly lesser gravity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry found he could leap eight feet in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air without any trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry split the landing party into four</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups, sending them spreading out like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spokes of a fan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't go more than three miles from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship without further orders. Study the</seg><seg type="columnLine">countryside thoroughly, and then report</seg><seg type="columnLine">back on board."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the landing party wore light armour</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steel coated with duralite, and carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray-tubes at their belts. Every third man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a heavier ray-gun with its cylindr ical</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine, not unlike the old-fashioned ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine gun. Their polished armor took on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden tinge as they tramped away across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grass-land, while behind them the Vik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lay motionless in the grass like a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpedo of steel and blue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry took personal command of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southernmost exploring party, leading them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a broad belt of forest. It was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">still beneath the giant trees, where strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow flowers hung from the branches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their path wound between clusters of ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot ferns. Huge toad-stools of purple and</seg><seg type="columnLine">green rose higher than their heads, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once they saw a giant ant some three feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">long who scuttled off through the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush with the speed of a galloping horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually Gerry became separated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of his party, bearing more to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southward as he caught a glimpse of more</seg><seg type="columnLine">open-country through the trees. Then, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of a small clearing, he abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted as half a dozen men appeared on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the far side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That is, Gerry thought of them as men</seg><seg type="columnLine">for lack of a better term. They were like</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing he had ever seen on either Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Mars or any of the planetoids between.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lean bodies were covered with glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray scales. Though the hands seemed hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, the feet were clawed and webbed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Short, flat tails hung behind them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces were scaleless, low-browed and green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed, with a jutting mouth and nose that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came together in a sort of snout. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had pointed ears that stood sharply erect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their general appearance was a little more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the animal side than the human, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had swords slung at their belts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried short-barreled rifles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the center of the group was a woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was naked except for a scarlet loin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth and golden breast-plates. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no semi-reptilian creature, but a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight and clean-limbed and beautiful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with long blonde hair that hung nearly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her waist. She had blue eyes, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin was about as white as Gerry's own,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it had a faintly tawny tinge so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she appeared all golden. At the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment her hands were tightly tied behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">her back and a cloth gag distended her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, while one of the Scaly Men led her</seg><seg type="columnLine">along by a rope about her neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry stepped out into the clearing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ray-tubes swinging free in his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His wide shoulders were thrown slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, his whole muscular body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensed and ready beneath his armor. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">always when he went into a fight, his lean</seg><seg type="columnLine">and normally somber face was smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE captive girl saw him first, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes widened in utter surprise. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the half dozen reptilian men caught sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lone Earth-man standing there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gleaming armor, and their snout-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouths sagged open. Gerry walked quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was half across the clearing before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venusians recovered from their sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. Then one of the patrol flung his</seg><seg type="columnLine">short rifle to his shoulder. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiss of escaping gas, and a split-second</seg><seg type="columnLine">later an explosive bullet struck him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest with a flash and a loud report. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have instantly killed an unprotected</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, but it did no more than slightly dent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry's armor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Earth-man half crouched, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowing and his jaw jutting suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. He had meant to try and parley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but diplomacy had no place with creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">who shot first and challenged afterward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His ray-tube swung up to the level. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sharp crackling sound, and for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second a murky red light played around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open end. The nearest Venusian crumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went down. He twitched for a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond, and then lay still. The gray scales</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned dead black in the area where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the death-ray had struck him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At least the Scaly Men had courage I</seg><seg type="columnLine">The remaining five came forward with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrill and almost canine yelping, advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a bent-legged run. Their rifles hissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the compressed gases were released, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive bullets crackled all around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry. Twice more his ray-tube let go its</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly blast--and then his weapon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. He cursed himself through</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched teeth for having strayed away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the patrol while armed only with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light tube with simply three charges. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the reptile men lay twitching in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall grass, but the other three were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most up to him. After that one volley</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had drawn their swords, which prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably meant that their compressed-gas rifles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were cumbersome things to reload.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Gerry Norton suddenly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered the greater strength of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthly muscles. As the foremost Venu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian lunged for him with long blade swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, Gerry bounded high into the air. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went clean over the head of his antagonist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming down squarely on top of the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. They both went sprawling, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry recovered first. Gripping the fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusian by the ankles, the Earth-man</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung him around his head like a flail and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled him squarely at the other two. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of them went down in a tangled heap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time the reptile men again</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled to their feet, Gerry had snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the sword of one of the men he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed with the ray-tube. Now he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to fight with! The long sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistled as he jerked it free from its scab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bard. For an instant he tested the blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">in both hands. It was forged of some blu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish metal that seemed as strong and flex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible as well-tempered steel. Then, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling his thin-lipped smile though his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were as cold as the wintry seas, Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton waited the onrush of the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were a few seconds of clashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel. The reptile men were good swords-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, but they were no match for the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strength of the Man from Earth. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them were stretched on the ground with</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloven skulls, and then the last survivor</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and ran. Gerry could have caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him easily, for the webbed feet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusian did not make for great speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was content to let him go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the scaly tail of the fleeing crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture had vanished in the underbrush, Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust his sword upright in the ground--</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it would be handy if he needed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in a hurry--and freed the golden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired girl from her bonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder where you fit into this pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, Bright Eyes!" he muttered, knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would not understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was certainly nothing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrinking violet about this girl! When her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were free she faced Gerry without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any sign of either fear or even much grati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude, standing erect with her hands on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hips and her eyes nearly on a level with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jaro quimtar--who are you ?" she asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Martian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GERRY stared at her in startled sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. The girl had unquestionably</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken in Martian. It was a very old and</seg><seg type="columnLine">antique form of the language that she used,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dialect that had not been heard on Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself for countless generations, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">poss'ble for Gerry to understand it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">last thing he had expected to find on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet of Venus was anyone who spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the tongues common on the Outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planets!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm Gerry Norton," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Geree!" the girl repeated. "You talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Same to you, sister," Gerry grinned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And just who are you, anyway?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Closana, of course, the daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Rupin-Sang!" the girl said haughtily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't you see the Golden Arrow ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She touched a small golden arrow that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung from a light chain about her neck. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be some kind of an insignia of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank. Her deep blue eyes were looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wear queer clothes, Geree," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said at last. "Where do you come from?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"From Earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She frowned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is that? Is it one of the lands</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the Great Sea?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Much farther away than that. It's an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other planet, far off in outer space."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You lie," she said. "Such a thing is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay, sister," Gerry snapped, "we</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't argue about that right now. Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were your unpleasant friends here? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do we do next?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closana walked across to take the sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one of the slain Reptilians. She tested</seg><seg type="columnLine">its balance, seemed satisfied, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">belted the scabbard about her own waist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She handled the long blade with the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perienced ease of a warrior, and for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time Gerry noticed the play of corded</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles beneath the smooth and tawny skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her arms and shoulders. Closana,</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter of Rupin-Sang, was feminine</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough but there was nothing of the cling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing vine about her! She threw her long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair back over her shoulders and faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry with the sword in her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You should have killed the last of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scaly Ones," she said, "instead of letting</seg><seg type="columnLine">him get away. Now he will bring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole raiding party down on us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are they, those things you call the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scaly Ones?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Their region lies beyond the frontier of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our land of Savissa," the girl explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We are near the boundaries now. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is constant warfare between ourselves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Scaly Ones. Now and then their raid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing parties break through our ring of bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rier forts, and it was a group of five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred such raiders that captured me this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. That one who escaped will bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest back with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I guess we'll need help!" Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">said grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was a two-way, short-wave ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dio set built into his helmet. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached up to adjust the switch, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed the alarm signal. A few seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">later he heard the answering voice of Por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tok the Martian, who was in command of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest of the Viking's exploring</seg><seg type="columnLine">parties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jumping ray-blasts, Chief, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering what had happened to you!''</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Guide on my transmitter and get here</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as you can!" Gerry snapped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hurry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later they saw a glint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor through the trees, and then the half</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen members of the exploring party</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged into the clearing. Their eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide with surprise as they saw Closana</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing beside Gerry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who's your yellow-haired friend,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief?" Portok asked with a broad grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had spoken in Martian, the two tongues</seg><seg type="columnLine">being practically interchangeable with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of the Interplanetary Fleet. Closana's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes flashed fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Speak of me with more respect, little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Red-face!" she snapped. Portok's jaw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sagged open, but before he could say any-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing further the underbrush on the far</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side of the clearing suddenly vomited a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yelling horde of the Scaly Ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They came in close-packed masses, yelp-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing shrilly. Their scaly skins and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blades of their swords gleamed in the sub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dued yellow light. Evidently bent on cap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ture of the small group of strangers, they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were not using their gas-guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Keep together! Fall back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship!" Gerry roared, drawing the sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had captured earlier in the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was a sharp crackle of ray-blasts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as the Earth-men fell back before the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">charging horde of the Scaly Ones. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">short hand-tubes were soon exhausted, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the heavy ray-guns carried by two of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men fired steadily. Murky light continu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ally played about their stubby muzzles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dozens of the Scaly Ones dropped, twitch-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing, in the tall grass before the deadly blast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the rays, but the shouting hordes came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on unchecked. And then a bugle sounded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">somewhere off on the flank!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, you scaly devils!" Closana</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed, facing about and waving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword high above her head, "The frontier</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards have arrived I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long lines of warriors charged out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the bushes to take the reptile men</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the flank. The front line of skirmishers</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried heavy bows and had quivers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows slung on their backs, the ranks</seg><seg type="columnLine">^behind were armed with shields and spears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rank by rank and company by company</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came, nearly a thousand strong, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringing clamor of brazen trumpets urging</seg><seg type="columnLine">them onward. Gerry Norton stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them blankly, scarcely able to believe what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw. All the warriors were women!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They were tall and clean-limbed, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">long golden hair that streamed behind them</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they ran. Like Closana, they wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright-colored loin cloths and had round</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold plates fastened across their breasts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The might of the Golden Amazons of Ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nus swept forward like a giant wave, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">12	PLAJVET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a spray of tossing spear points above it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then the trumpets sounded again, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arrow storm began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The front ranks loosed their long shafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, and the air became full of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twang of bow-strings and hiss of speeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows. A shouting officer of the Scaly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones went down with a pair of shafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathered in his chest. His men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping all about him as the gold-tipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows struck home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE reptile men were using their gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns now. The sharp hiss of the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charges rose above the twang of the bow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strings, the snap of the exploding bullets</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a crackle of old-fashioned mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ketry. The projectiles ripped holes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front ranks of the Amazons, but they still</seg><seg type="columnLine">came bounding forward.. Then the sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">reports of the exploding bullets died away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the gas-guns were cumbersome things</seg><seg type="columnLine">to re-charge and there was no time. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two lines met with a clash of steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry Norton had thrown his armoured</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth-men and Martians as a guard around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Closana when she ran toward the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Amazon line. On two occasions small</seg><seg type="columnLine">parties of the Scaly Ones cut their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the guarding spears to reach them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each time the blast of the heavy ray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns mowed them down. The clatter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting blades was like the noise of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand smithies, the shrill yelping of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptile men was drowned out by the trium-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant blast of the Amazon trumpets. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scaly Ones were giving back all along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, under pressure of superior numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the greater agility of the lithe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amazons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry fought with the long, blue-bladed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sworcl in his hand and the shield of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen Amazon on his left arm. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater strength of his earthly muscles, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">raged through the fighting while his heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade wrought deadly execution. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was over! The Scaly Ones broke up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into scores of fleeing groups and fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">companies of Amazons bounded in pursuit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with their long bows twanging. Closana</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned on her dripping blade and held out</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a good fight, Geree. I think I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will take you for my husband."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," Gerry said, "We'll just leave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that idea for discussion some other time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE fleeing survivors of the Scaly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones had gone, with companies of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed Amazons in hot pursuit. The others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tending the wounded and gathering up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead, picking up fallen weapons, doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the routine tasks that are the aftermath</seg><seg type="columnLine">of battle. Closana was now surrounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a body-guard of tall, blonde Amazons</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose lion-cloths bore the same design of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden arrow-head as her own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," she said to Gerry, "that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">should come to see my father Rupin-Sang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is ruler of this land."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quite a thinker, decided Gerry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can take you there in the ship if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">show us the way," he said shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A horde of Amazons^ thronged around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big blue-and-silver hull of the Viking</seg><seg type="columnLine">where she lay in the knee-high grass. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the members of the landing party filed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board and turned their ray-tubes in to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ordnance Officer to be recharged, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the crew came out to stare at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the visitors. Angus McTavish stood on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps of the ladder with his big fists on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will ye look at all the bonny lassies!'</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "This may not be such a bad planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The feminine warriors of Venus saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTavish then, and a sudden murmur</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept over the throng. An instant later a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred blades flashed in the air in salute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then all the Amazons dropped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one knee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now what the devil . . .?" muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve Brent who had come out of the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">just behind McTavish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a proper tribute to my outstanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">personality, lad!" the big Scot muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside. Closana read the surprise in Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are few men in this land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savissa," she explained, "And the wearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a beard is the sign of a noble of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest rank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wonder how long it will take me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow a good crop of whiskers!" Steve said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closana and a dozen of her body-guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">came aboard, looking curiously about them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the Venusian princess walked into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control room she came face to face with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Olga Stark. For a long moment the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS	13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">women stood looking at each other, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">clashing glances hard and intent. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden Venusian and the dark haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthling. Then Closana shrugged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not like her," she said calmly. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow flush spread over Olga Stark's face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her eyes smoldered, but she did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With helicopters spinning, the Viking</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose a thousand feet in the air. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved ahead at minimum cruising speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Closana stood at one of the control room</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows to point the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was a strange land that they saw mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing past below them, though a pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. There were rolling uplands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches of forest, and occasional villages</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by broad tilled fields. Except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the yellowish tinge to the vegetation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the odd shapes of the trees, it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been an Earthly countryside. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry noticed another thing! Though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was broad daylight, as bright as it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">become on this planet, there were no shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows at all. The diffusing effect of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eternal cloud barrier kept the light equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Land of No Shadow!" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud. For the first time in this busy day</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought of the fact tliat they were forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">million miles from home. If anything hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to the Viking, they would spend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of their lives here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They passed some of the barrier forts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">square and stone walled buildings reminis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent of medieval castles on Earth. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">misty hills beyond, Closana told Gerrv, lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country of the Scaly Ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it like?" he asked. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged, but her eyes were shadowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All I know about it is legend, the sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tales that old women tell in the evenings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many of our people have been taken there</seg><seg type="columnLine">as prisoners in raids, but none has ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned alive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving Steve Brent in command in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control room for the moment, Gerry went</seg><seg type="columnLine">aft to his quarters where he had a compact</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tri-dimensional-cinema outfit. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing along one of the corridors on</seg><seg type="columnLine">B-deck when he abruptly halted. A faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">humming was coming from behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed door of the radio room!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Viking's sending outfit was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough to bridge the vastness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">interplanetary space. Such outfits existed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, but only a small set had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">installed on the space-ship because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extra weight involved. The radio room had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been closed and locked weeks ago. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was supposed to have access to it except</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve Brent and Gerry himself. And yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the unmistakable hum of a generator</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming from behind the closed door!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry cautiously tested the knob of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. It gave under his hand. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the portal a crack, he clearly heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sharp murmur of the sending apparatus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he swung the door wide on its noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less and well oiled hinges. A dim light</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed across the room! A dark figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">was crouched tensely over the table that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the sending set. At the moment Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not see who it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two steps Gerry took into the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three steps. The rubberoid soles of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes friade no sound. Then a crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight descended on top of his head! In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the half second before he lost conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, he realized that there had been a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond interloper in the radio room. Someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been crouching against the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the door, and who had slugged him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN consciousness returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry Norton, he was lying alone on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor of the darkened radio room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat up, and rubbed his aching head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore softly. There was no sign of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interlopers, nor any clue to their identity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole incident puzzled him. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">assailants must have been from among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Viking's crew. That was surprising enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">in itself, but there was also the problem of</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive. Why would anybody be sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">a secret message when there was no re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiving set within millions of miles? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing just didn't make sense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closing the radio room behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry went back to the control-room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew Steve Brent aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Steve!

Steve grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm serious. That really happened."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry snapped. The grin faded from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brent's freckled face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then it must have been Chester Sand,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said promptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why do you say that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brent shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because he's the only man aboard that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know too well to suspect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Interesting logic," Gerry grunted, "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can't lock a man up on such negative</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds.

Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">women drove small carts along the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads that wound through the fields. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem to be any men in this land at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. Then, atong the far horizon ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there began to lift the domes and towers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and minarets of a mighty city. Closana</seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly lifted her arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Golden City of Larr!" she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Capitol of our land of Savissa. None</seg><seg type="columnLine">but our own people have ever penetrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">those walls except as prisoners of war."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The walled city of larr dominated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain in all its towered splendor. Its walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of polished yellow stone were more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet high. The serrated battle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments at the top were faced with plates</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thin gold. Domes of blue and scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed within the walls. Slender min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arets lifted their lattices high in the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the center was a massive round tower</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose top was shaped like the point of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden arrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But surely your people never built 'his</seg><seg type="columnLine">place!" he gasped.

Larr, the Golden City,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is very ancient. It was built by the Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones--they who lived here long ago. in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim dawn of time. I have forgotten most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tale but my father can tell you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">As they passed over the outer walls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry saw some long steel tubes mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on swivels above the battlements. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were protected by gleaming metal shields.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He touched Closana's arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are those things that look like</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant ray-guns?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those are the defences of the walls,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl answered, "We also have them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrier forts.

Steve Brent</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodded him gently in the ribs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Persistent souls, these Golden Ama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zons !" he said in English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE appearance of the Viking in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air over Larr created a mounting ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement among the citizens of the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the open windows of the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">room Gerry could hear the brazen clamor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many trumpets, sounding the alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crowds appeared on the roofs. Arrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaked up at the space-ship, futile shafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fell short of the mark. As they neared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the central tower, gun crews swarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two of the ray-tubes. Knowing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">resisting power of the Viking's duraiite</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull, Gerry was not greatly worried, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Closana seemed to feel that things had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">far enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hitherto the girl had been quite evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoying the consternation that the Viking's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival had caused among the defenders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city. Now she leaned far out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open window and waved reassuringly. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was recognized, defense preparations</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased and the gun crews began to cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">their weapons up again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Viking settled gently down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn stone pavement of a square plaza di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly before the central tower. A ring of</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazon spearmen instantly formed to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the curious crowds, and other compa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nies were drawn up as a guard of honor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They saluted Closana with a shout and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">surge of uplifted spears when she and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry stepped out the opened starboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Then, when Angus McTavish came</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENVS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out with a group of senior officers a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds later, all the Amazon warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped instantly down on one knee while</seg><seg type="columnLine">their spear-points rattled on the stones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The big engineer beamed through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard, and tilted his uniform cap to a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">rakish angle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have already stated that these folk are</seg><seg type="columnLine">a verra discriminating people!" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">with deep satisfaction.

And one other. . . He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated, then named Olga Stark. Later</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was to wonder what evil genius had led</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to select her as one of the party. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not quite remember. Probably it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just a desire to take as varied and</seg><seg type="columnLine">representative a group along with him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. Closana looked annoyed at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice, but did not comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY passed through the ranks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear-guard, and up to the octagonal</seg><seg type="columnLine">main door of the tower where carved</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden leaves slid back into the wall on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side. A blue light glowed around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner frame of the door, and Closana held</seg><seg type="columnLine">up her arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait till the blue light fades, for it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Death," she said quietly. Then, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light died out, they all stepped inside while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the golden leaves of the door closed clash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were in a winding corridor whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone walls were faced with polished stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hung with ancient tapestries. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">place was lighted by metal discs set flush</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ceiling, discs of a substance that gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth a soft and golden glow'. Even this</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, Gerry noticed, was so diffused as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be shadowless. "The Land of No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shadow!" he muttered under his breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembering the phrase that had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him earlier. Somehow the friendly old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth seemed very far away at that mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an ante-chamber they met the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">man they had seen since they reached Ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nus, aside from the half-animal raiders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Scaly Ones. This man was short and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight, with a very high forehead and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually large eyes. His skin had the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">tawny tinge as that of the feminine war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors of his race, but he was more lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">built than they. He wore a loose yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunic, and his hair and thin beard were</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily shot with gray. Somehow he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked tired, and old even beyond his</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, as though the sands of his race were</seg><seg type="columnLine">running very low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rupin-Sang awaits your coming," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to Gerry. As Portok and the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Viking came into sight, the Venu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian stared at them with strangely startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. He said nothing more, but his glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to hold a strange, terrible haunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of the corridor they stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a small golden car. A door closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them. The floor shot rapidly up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. A few seconds later the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lift-car swung open again and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out into a round chamber near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the great tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enter to His Highness Rupin-Sang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord of Savissa and the Mountain Lands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruler of field and forest and castle, heredi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary Warden of the Great Sea!" the Venu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian courtier said sonorously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room was circular, with glassless</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows set in the walls every few feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A warm breeze blew in to stir the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal discs that hung around near the tops</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the walls in a sort of frieze, setting them</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging till they clashed together with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuous jingling. A small fountain mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mured in the center of the room. A pecu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liarly shaped telescope stood by one wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were other scientific instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a type unfamiliar to the Earth-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN a big carved chair in the center sat a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very old man, a rolled parchment lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his knees. What remained of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair and beard were pure white. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lined and sunken. He half raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm in a ceremonial gesture of welcome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but then a sudden expression of alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">came over his face. He pointed with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''/lie--woe to the City of Larr! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">16	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of the fulfilment of the prophecy is</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hand! Woe to Larr, with its walls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">towers!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closana hurried to her father's side. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later the old man had regained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm. He greeted them with formalized</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech of welcome full of old phrases, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">added:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forgive my agitation when you first en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, hisiren, but it brought to mind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom-filled phrases of what we of Savissa</seg><seg type="columnLine">call the Prophecy of Jeddah-Khana."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a very old prophecy, carved in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient runic script on the stone walls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the vaults under this tower.

Rupin-Sang</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed and touched his forehead as h£ men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned the Old Ones. "The Prophecy</seg><seg type="columnLine">states that the day will come when a red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinned man and a dark-haired woman and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ruddy, bearded giant will come together</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the city from afar, and that within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">month thereafter the Golden City of Larr</seg><seg type="columnLine">will crumble and return to the dust."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But surely you don't take such old</seg><seg type="columnLine">legends seriously!" Gerry said. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My head tells me not to, but supersi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is strong in we of Savissa.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of this talk of portents and legends!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I give you welcome to Savissa, and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of Larr. Also, I thank you for rescu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my youngest daughter from the Scaly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raiders. Whence come ye?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry sketched in hasty phrases the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of present conditions on Earth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars, and told of their trip through space</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Venus in the Viking. Rupin-Sang</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded without showing any particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so that's the story," Gerry con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded.

"In the days of the Old Ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a natural balance of the sexes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, as the slow centuries passed, the birth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rate gradually changed. Now one child in</seg><seg type="columnLine">five thousand born in Savissa is a male.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The few men we do have are needed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain administrative and scientific work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly the supervision of the alta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">radium mines in the mountains from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we get the raw material for the alta-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes that are our greatest protection</seg><seg type="columnLine">against invasion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw the tubes on the walls," Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "but why is it that your mobile forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">are armed only with primitive weapons like</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows and arrows?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because we cannot possibly mine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce enough of the alta-radium to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than supply the defences of the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of the barrier forts.

He touched a control lever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the mechanism began to hum. Blinds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dropped down over the windows, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the room was filled with a murky twi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. The humming sound grew steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">louder. Now the metal disc glowed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brilliant light. Momentarily its polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface clouded over, as though obscured</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a thin fog, and then the mists drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEFORE them they saw the Universe</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was in the youth of the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when roaring volcanoes were still active on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Moon and the rings of Saturn were</seg><seg type="columnLine">just drifting out from the girth of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning sphere.

The machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a perfect illusion of reality, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely tri-dimensional but touching all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses as well. They could hear the roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of new-made satellites spinning off into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">void, and the rush of burning gases. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">could smell the scent of molten rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then time passed! The planets began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cool. The mud-flats steamed under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloudy sun, the mountains shouldered their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way upward through the tilted and riven</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields. On the edges of inland seaS*, the hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallows were filled with slimy things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled with their bellies dragging. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the ripple of the waters, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustle of warm winds blowing through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowerless and fern-like forests. Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">could smell the rank odors of the steaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">and primitive jungles. There was a pun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent taste on his lips. Once he stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand out toward a trilobite that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be crawling up to his feet--and he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coarse surface of the shell before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled his hand back again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The picture changed once more, center-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on a ruddy planet that swept toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them while Portok exclaimed at the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mars in the ancient days before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets were built. Men and women walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">its smooth fields, among the flaming scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers. Music and laughter and the voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">of women drifted on the scented winds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Mars was changing. It was drying up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Life could no longer be the same. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the people were beginning to draft the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans for the great canals that were to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve the planet's failing supply of water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but others took to space-ships and sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">off into the void.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then, for the first time, they saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet Venus as the Martian space-ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped down through the veiling clouds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They saw those first pioneers of space land</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Venus, and subjugate the natives, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">build mighty cities in the plains.

The holdings of the descendants</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those interplanetary travelers of long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago dwindled to only the city of Larr and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land of Savissa itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The humming of the Temporascope died</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. The big metal disc again became</seg><seg type="columnLine">2--Planet Stories--Winter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blank. The machine had ceased to function,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the illusion of the reality of the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone. They were simply in a shaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower room with a tired old man who sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a carved throne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And that is the tale of the rise and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cline of our people, hiziren," he said sadly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now the sands of our nation run low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I am half inclined to believe that the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">prophecy will come true, and that this is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight of Savissa and its people. But--</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of that. Raise the blinds again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rotosa, so that we may have light while</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can. And I ask you visitors from afar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dine with me tonight before you go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your space-ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE banquet table was set on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground floor of the Arrow-Tower, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a room where an open colonnade looked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a walled garden behind the palace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rulers of Savissa. A carved wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">table was set with golden plates. Faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">music came from some hidden source. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garden outside, night birds sang softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was a constant sound of running</seg><seg type="columnLine">water from many fountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In addition to Rupin-Sang, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of his male attendants and about</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty women. On this ceremonial occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion they supplemented their usual scanty</seg><seg type="columnLine">garb with long and graceful robes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed like silk. Thin veils were at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached to jeweled circlets. Catching a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of the sullen discontent on Olga</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stark's face, Gerry suddenly realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earth woman was jealous of her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Probably hating my guts right now for</seg><seg type="columnLine">making her wear her uniform!" he thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Women are queer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To Gerry Norton, that meal was a peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful interlude between the monotonous</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain of the long interplanetary voyage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the uncertainty of what lay ahead. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the native dishes tasted strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his Earthly palate, the food was gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally good. Fragrant, heady wines from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill country bordering Savissa were served</seg><seg type="columnLine">in colored glass goblets. A sound of distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">singing drifted across the garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gerry was wondering what disaster had</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtaken the first expedition that had set</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to reach this planet, the space-ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stardust that had left Earth over two years</seg><seg type="columnLine">18</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ago under command of Major Walter Lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sing. Perhaps it had landed in some less</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly part of the planet and been over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed by the natives before it could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away again. Perhaps it had met some swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster in outer space and was now spin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning endlessly in the void--a lifeless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">man-made planetoid. In any case, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a thorough search for some trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Stardust before he started back to Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the meal was over and they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose from the table, Gerry noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Angus and Olga Stark walked out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garden together. It struck him as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd combination, for Olga was the one per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son on board with whom the genial Scot</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not friendly. Then he forgot about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later Closana took Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ry's arm and led him out into the garden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colored lanterns hung here and there along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paths, but most of the light came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes of glowing metal that were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed near the tops of the trees. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect was much like Earthly moonlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that the moon was golden instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver. Angus and Olga should have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few yards ahead of them, but both had</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared. Gerry wondered about it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then a dim figure rose up in the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows immediately before him. A cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking gas, hurled squarely in his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some sort of flask, filled his lungs</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the pain of many fiery needles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry crumpled soundlessly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. He could see and hear what went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, but otherwise he was paralyzed and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of sound or movement. For a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment he thought that Closana was behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">some form of treachery. Then dark fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures swarmed around him, lifting him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, and he saw the dim light gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on gray scales. The Scaly Ones had</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrated to the innermost sanctuary of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the City of Larr!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry's head fell back as they lifted him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he could see that Closana was equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless in the grip of more of the raid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers. A section of grass and bushes was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung back on a hidden trap door, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealing a flight of moss-covered stone steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading downward. The two prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">were carried down, and the door dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollowly into place above them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY were in a narrow and very an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient stone passage. Moss and lichens</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the walls, moisture dripped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ceiling. On the floor in the midst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another group of the Scaly Ones lay An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gus McTavish, evidently also a victim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paralyzing gas. Olga Stark stood near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by, her long dark hair loose about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and an expression of savage tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umph irf'fier eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tie them securely!" she snapped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer in command of the Scaly Men. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-nosed, brutish face creased in a grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It shall be done, Mistress!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closana was stripped to her loin-cloth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A cloth gag was twisted into her mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arms were tied behind her back. Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Angus were treated in the same way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Control of his muscles was returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly to Gerry Norton now, as the ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fects of the gas wore off, but he was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready secured and helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grim rage filled Gerry then, but even</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater than that emotion was his utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement. The thing was completely be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond his understanding. This was no rou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tine raid of the Scaly Ones against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of Larr, but a definite attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture him! Strangest of all was the part</seg><seg type="columnLine">played by Olga Stark, who acted as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was in command of the Scaly Men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It just wasn't possible--but it was hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three prisoners were pulled to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Guards gripped their elbows. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first bend in the passage a small waterfall</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down from above and formed a gur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling stream that ran in a deep gutter at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side. The air was hot, and moist, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy with the scent of running water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungus growths. Other jets of water came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from above to add to the trickle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water until, as the passage widened, a gur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling torrent ran along beside them. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly Gerry realized where they were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the sewerage system that carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the waste of the city's many flowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountains!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last they came to the main drain, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaulted stone passage where a twenty-foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of black water flowed along beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow foot-path. Tied up there, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like a sea-monster in the dim light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lanterns carried by the Scaly Men, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a metal boat that had only a narrow deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a round dome above the water. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude submarine!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three prisoners were forced aboard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their gags were removed, now that si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence no longer mattered, but their arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained bound and they were chained by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the necks to a steel bar as they sat in a row</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one side of the narrow hull. The raid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers cast off, came aboard, and closed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome behind them. Motors hummed softly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the submarine ■ moved sluggishly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the moment the three of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. They could see the scaly skins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of their captors busied at various</seg><seg type="columnLine">tasks in adjoining compartments, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no one within hearing. After twisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">futilely at his bonds for a moment, Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned back against the steel bulkhead be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him and looked over at Angus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--here we are!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye--so it seems!" The Scot's broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was grim. "I should have known that</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-haired witch had some deviltry in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind when she asked me to walk in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden with her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where does she fit into the pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture? How does she get her control over</seg><seg type="columnLine">these scaly devils?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do I know?" snorted McTavish</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily. "Ask me some more riddles!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What's more to the point is where they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking us in this queer craft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can guess that," Closana said quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl was very pale, but she smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly as she met Gerry's eyes. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">drain empties into the Giri river, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few miles farther along that river forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boundary between Savissa and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands of the Scaly Ones. We have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">known they could travel beneath the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What will happen after they get us</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Torture and death. Once any of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">people are taken across into the land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Giri-Vaaka, they never return alive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nice little trip we're taking, Gerry lad!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTavish growled. "Too bad you didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring your cinema camera along I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE submarine moved sluggishly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, silent except for the hum of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors. As Gerry looked around he could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">see that it was a crudely constructed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">makeshift craft. Even so, it was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have expected from men of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent mentality of the Scaly Ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thfc is a funny sort of submarine!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said to Angus. The big engineer, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had twisted around to peer at the bulkhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly behind them, growled deep in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's funnier than ye think, lad! Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this !" McTavish nodded toward one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheets of thin steel from which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulkhead had been built. On the edge there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stamped a few words. The letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">were small, and in the dim light Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to narrow his eyes for a moment be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he could read them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">U. S. Gov't Steel lVoi*%s</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlanta, Ga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How in Heaven's name did they get</seg><seg type="columnLine">that . . . ?" Gerry's voice trailed off with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out finishing the sentence. McTavish</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ye don't need more than one guess.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Stardust must have, been wrecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere near here, and these devils took</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of her parts to build this outlandish</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, long hours later, the submarine</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a stop. As his captors led him up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on deck, Gerry saw that the ungainly craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grounded in the shallows on the shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a broad river. It was just daylight. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale yellow light filtered down through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canopy of clouds, and a flight of marsh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fowl was winging by just overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are we?" asked Gerry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the Giri River," Closana said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Savissa lies on the far shore. This is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of the Scaly Ones."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the reptile men hauled the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine into a cove and began to cover it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over with piles of reeds. Some twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">others formed up in a column with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three prisoners in the center. Then the of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficer in command barked an order and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">all moved out along a dirt road that led</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the river. Olga Stark was</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking beside the first rank of scaly war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors. She had not looked at the prison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They tramped steadily onward through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dust in silence except for the dull slap</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the webbed feet of the reptile men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jingle of their equipment. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the officer in command came back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at the prisoners. He was a grizzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">veteran with shaggy ridges above his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the long-healed scars of-half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">old wounds on his scaly body. McTavish</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared at him for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take a good look, sonny boy!" the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scot growled. "What's your name--if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have one?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should tear out your tongue for</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking in that tone to an officer of Giri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vaaka," the officer said. His voice had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high pitched and metallic quality typical of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his race, and he bared his pointed teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a not unfriendly grin, "but the torturers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Lord Lansa will take care of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon enough. I am Toll, commander of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strikka in the border guards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you taking us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toll grinned wickedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the palace of Lansa, overlord of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GERRY noticed that this countryside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Giri-Vaaka was very different</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pleasant and cultivated fields of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savissa over which he had passed the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. The roads were dirt and half over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown. Not much of the country was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der cultivation. Strange purple bushes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with thorns a foot long covered much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land, crowding close on the patches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest where ten-foot ferns towered high</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead. Sometimes they came upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazing herd of the yard-long giant ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would go galloping away with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">antenna waving in the air and their hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelled leg-joints clicking loudly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Depression hung on Gerry Norton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest like a physical weight. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone the fact that every stride carried them</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper into a grim and hostile land--pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oners whose doom was probably already</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealed--that set him biting his lower lip</seg><seg type="columnLine">till he tasted the salt blood on his tongue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor even the fact that Closana shared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same fate because she happened to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been with him at the time of the raid. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also the utter strangeness of every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Yesterday, in Savissa, the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the mode of life had been nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to normal so that he was not deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious of the strange vegetation and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">other things in which Venus differed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth and Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now everything seemed different, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">alien. The lowering yellow skies of Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ominous. The hot winds brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange smells tand seemed to carry a hint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doom. The one thought that gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">any real hope was the fact that Portok</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian had not been captured with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of them. He must have missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them soon cfter the abduction. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be a chance that he and Steve Brent</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring the Viking to look for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY had begun to pass occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">small farms. These were scanty fields</seg><seg type="columnLine">carved out of the creeping masses of purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorns, usually with a roughly thatched hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center. On one such occasion the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer and his family stood apathetically</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the roadside to watch the patrol of Rep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tile Men go by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they're not scaly!" Gerry ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. Closana shook her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. They are of the Green Men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Giri. Once they held this land while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scaly Ones dwelt in the marshes of Vaaka</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther west, but the Scaly Ones have now</seg><seg type="columnLine">been masters of this place for many gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Green Men, Gerry noticed, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like ordinary Earthlings except for a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenish cast to their skin. Probably, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Golden Amazons, they were also de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended from the Old Ones who had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Mars so long ago. The ragged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud-stained fanner gave Toll a perfunc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory salute, and then leaned on his hoe to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch the column pass by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warriors of Toll swaggered along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road with the insolent assurance of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who know themselves masters of all around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The farmer's green face was care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully expressionless, but there was a gleam</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes that spoke of no great liking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his scaly masters. When his glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingered on Gerry's for an instant, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth-man read a definite sympathy in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They camped that night in a clearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside a small stream. One of the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot a giant ant with his gas-gun, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracked open the horny shell with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword. They cut long strips of the meat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roasted it over a fire. Though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste was peculiar the stuff was edible, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS	21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the three prisoners managed to swallow it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The condemned man ate a hearty</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal!" Angus McTavish said with grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor, wiping his fingers on the coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow grass beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Olga had gone on with a faster-moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">detachment, and only a dozen Scaly Ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained with Toll to guard the three pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oners. Gerry and Closana sat side by side</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the fire, their bare shoulders touch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The ruddy and flickering glow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firelight touched Angus' giant frame a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle farther around the circle, and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaly skins and long snouts of the reptile</seg><seg type="columnLine">men watching them. Gerry clasped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms around his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Y'know Angus, at the moment we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">living as our ancestors must have lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">long generations ago. No ray-tubes or</seg><seg type="columnLine">dura-steel armor. No portable electro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phones. Not even a low-speed rocket car</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry us along. It must have been this</seg><seg type="columnLine">way back in the days when they built that</seg><seg type="columnLine">little old building that's now used for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">museum in New York. The Empire State</seg><seg type="columnLine">Building."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got your dates mixed, laddie,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTavish yawned. "The Empire State</seg><seg type="columnLine">was built in the twentieth century, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the people of those queer old days</seg><seg type="columnLine">were more advanced than most of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we've seen of life on this planet of Venus."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't suppose those Ancients knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they were missing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe they were better off! At least</seg><seg type="columnLine">they only got into trouble on their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth instead of wandering off to other</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets like a pack of fools as we have!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toll and two of his men came toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, earning the ropes with which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had earlier been bound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry, but I must tie you up for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night," he said. For an instant Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of making a break. If he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away he might find some way of res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuing the others. Then he decided against</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. One of the reptile men would be al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most sure to bring him down with a gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun before he got out of the circle of fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, in spite of the greater strength of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Earthly mdscles. So he shrugged, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed the guards to tie him up again. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a while he lay awake, hoping to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hum of the Viking's motors, but at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fell asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the thjrd day of their journey, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail led upward, into a range of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleak and rocky hills. A few mean huts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the only signs of human habitation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as they rounded a bend in the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">which at this point clung to the face of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff, they saw the answer to a mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had puzzled the civilized world for</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the wreck of the space-ship Star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust. She lay at the foot of a cliff across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley, her steel and duralite hull still</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming brightly through the thick green</seg><seg type="columnLine">creepers that had grown up around it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even from this distance Gerry could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hopelessly crumpled rocket-tubes at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern, and the gaping holes where plates</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been ripped away to make the subma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rine that had brought them out of the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Larr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that was the end of the Stardust!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry muttered. "I wonder what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to her crew!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll probably find out soon enough!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTavish replied grimly. "I'll bet all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold in Savissa against an empty rocket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil tin that we're headed for the same fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor devils--I suppose the Scaly Ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">did get them. I never liked Walter Lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sing, as you know, but I could have wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">him better luck than this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last they crossed the hills and saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad valley before them. Dim and snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">capped mountains notched the yellow sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the far side of the Valley. A river</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound through the plain, and on the shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the saffron waters of a mighty lake they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the gray walls of a city. Toll, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptilian captain, pointed across the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yonder lies the city of Vaaka-hausen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon you will stand before the Lord Lansa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then," he added with a grim and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghoulish humor, "neither I nor anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">else will be bothered with you any more."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The countryside immediately around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of the Scaly Ones was better kept and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more cultivated than what they had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rest of Giri-Vaaka. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of small villages. Then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed in through the walls, gray stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">ramparts that seemed to be very old and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in poor repair. The muzzles of heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">caliber gas-guns peered over the battle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments here and there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">22	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowds in the streets stared cu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riously as Toll led his prisoners toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the city. Tall reptile men swag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered through the crowds with their swords</seg><seg type="columnLine">slung on their hips, but the shorter Green</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men were in the great majority. Most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, men and women alike, stared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captives without any particular sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion. This gray and crowded city of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vaaka-hausen had none of the atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pleasant friendliness that Gerry had no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed in Larr. It seemed a place of fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and oppression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE palace of the ruler of the Scaly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones was a squat gray building in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the city. An arm of the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept along beneath one wall, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddy waters lapping at the aged gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones. An iron gate swung aside to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newcomers into the courtyard. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who wore black metal breast-plates over</seg><seg type="columnLine">their scales took over the prisoners from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toll, leading them down a long flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs into the dungeons beneath the pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ace. They waited in a vaulted chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the only light was a shaft of yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance that came from a narrow slit</seg><seg type="columnLine">high up near the ceiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't be long now!" Gerry mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a gong sounded somewhere near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by. It was a very resonant and deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">throated gong, and instantly the rock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walled chamber became filled with a green</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. It had no visible source, seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come from the walls or from the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">air itself. Again the gong rolled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Lord Lansa comes!" barked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain of the guards, "the overlord of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus is at hand. Down on your knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">captives and slaves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closana went to her knees, though oth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erwise holding herself proudly erect with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands tied behind her back. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenish light her long blonde hair looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like molten gold. Angus McTavish mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered savagely in his beard and stayed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. Instantly one of the reptile</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards drew his sword and held the blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizontally behind the Scot's knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kneel--or I cut the tendons!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come down, you stiff-necked idiot!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry growled. With a muttered oath</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Angus dropped to his knees, and the guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back into line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the door opened, and three men</seg><seg type="columnLine">came slowly intoSthe room. Two were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray-scaled guards who carried their gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns cocked and ready. The third was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall man in a loose green robe. His head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hooded, so that nothing of his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen at all, his hands were tucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sleeves of his robe. There was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing deadly and almost grotesque about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that silent figure. Gerrv knew that at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in the presence of Lansa. Lord of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Scaly Ones and ruler of Giri-Vaaka,</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-styled Overlord of all Venus!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE seconds passed in silence. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards were frozen motionless at at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention. At last Lansa spoke, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming hollowly from the shadows of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take them to the cells. Their doom</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall be decided when the Serpent Gods</seg><seg type="columnLine">have spoken. I have ordered it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tyrant of Venus gestured sharply,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the guards closed in about the pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oners. For a fleeting instant Gerry had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of a thin green hand, a hand where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finger was missing at the second joint.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Lansa went out and the door closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him. The deeply resonant gong</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded again, and the pulsating green light</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly vanished so that there was again</seg><seg type="columnLine">no light except for the thin trickle of yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low radiance that came in the single high</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. The prisoners were pulled to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no chance to speak to Angus</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Closana again. Gerry's guards led him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a narrow corridor, past the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors of cells. It was very dim and si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent. From some of the cells he heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint rattle of chains, from others a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaning. Otherwise there was no sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">but their own footfalls. At last the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the door of a cell, pushed Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside, and cut the ropes that bound his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. As they slammed the heavy steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">door behind them he heard the rasp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolts. Then the slapping tread of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards' webbed feet died away and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">left alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dim as the light in the corridor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, that in the cell was so much less that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry had to wait half a minute before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could see at all. Then he made out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlines of a small, bare cell with a bunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of a light and flexible metal at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. There was nothing else in the place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry rubbed his wrists a moment to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">store circulation, then sat down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the bunk and dropped his head in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to be about at the end of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail. Well--that was fate. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind so much for himself and Angus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You knew you were taking risks when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed up for interplanetary travel in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first place! But he was sorry that Cl°sana</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been dragged into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry had now lost all hope of rescue</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Viking. He did not doubt that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">duralite hull could withstand the explosive</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets of even the heaviest caliber gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, nor that her three-inch ray-tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">could blast a way into these underground</seg><seg type="columnLine">dungeons in a few minutes. If only Steve</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brent knew where to come! That was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rub. There was now no way for Brent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn where the prisoners were being held,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he could not search all the land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Giri-Vaaka.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something small and furtive was moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">about on the floor a few feet away. Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">scuffed his feet on the stones, and the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture scampered quickly away. Probably a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat! It seemed that he was going to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant company during his stay in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Restless and gloomy, Gerry stood up</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He started to walk up and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the few feet that the length of his cell</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed him. Then he froze motionless!</seg><seg type="columnLine">A faint tapping was sounding from some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where to his left. Someone was knocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly on the wall of the adjoining cell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a voice spoke softly in Martian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You there ! You in the next cell! Can</seg><seg type="columnLine">you here me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GERRY knelt down on the damp floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put his head close to the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wall. Now he could hear the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">more clearly, could even hear his heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing. Gerry's groping fingers found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a place between two of the stones where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mortar had been picked away to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small air space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I hear you!" he called softly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a dry chuckle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good! I have been waiting a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for them to put someone in the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell. Some of the stones are loose. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a soft rattle of falling mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tar. and a scrape of sliding stones. Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the head and shoulders of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust through the opening, and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man crawled laboriously into the cell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" he whispered. "Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">accent is not like that of the Green Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Giri. Wait, I have a light here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small flashlight clicked on. Its beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed up into Gerry's face. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord!" he whispered. "It . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's Gerry Norton!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the man swung the light so that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung on himself. Gerry saw a tall, gaunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the tattered remains of a blue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver uniform. It was Major Walter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lansing, once of the Interplanetary Fleet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had commanded the ill-fated Stardust</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she set out on her voyage into space!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Norton!" he gasped in a hoarse whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per. "Man, I never expected to see anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Earth again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We thought you were dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I might as well be!" Lansing said</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly. "But tell me how you come to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they squatted there in the darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell, Gerry whispered the story of the Vik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing's expedition and of his own capture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lansing told him how the Stardust had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been wrecked on the rim of the mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">when landing, and how the Scaly Ones had</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured all the crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have kept me alive because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs pointed that way when they cast the</seg><seg type="columnLine">omens before the Serpent Gods," Lansing</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "but all the rest of the crew were</seg><seg type="columnLine">used as bait for hunting the giant Dakta.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They died. You and your companions will</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably meet the same fate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pleasant prospect!" Gerry said grimly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lansing gripped his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a chance, Norton! Listen!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've been able to get these scaly devils to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring me a good many things from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck. I couldn't get a ray-tube, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were too wise for that, but I did get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">portable radio by telling them it was my</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribal god. I have it in my cell. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">go over and you can phone your ship to</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">come after us." He eyed Gerry eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They both crawled through the gap in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall. It was like Gerry's own, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was piled with an assortment of junk from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrecked space-ship. In one corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood a compact two-way radio telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">set with its tubes still intact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think you can tell them how to come ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lansing whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not sure. They marched us along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roads, and the route was winding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll draw you a map!" Lansing inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted. "You hold the light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Gerry held the flash, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">man spread out a piece of crumpled paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor and began to draw on it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stub of a graphite stylus. He talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he wrote, in a shrilly, excited whisper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry had never liked the man in the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, considering him excitable and unde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendable, and it was evident that the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">captivity had not improved Walter Lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sing's self-control. That did not matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The main thing was to get out of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. And then Gerry saw something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffened every muscle and made the short</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair prickle all down the back of his neck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ring finger of Lansing's left hand was</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing at the second joint!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE suspicion that had come to Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton seemed impossible. Walter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lansing . . . the Lord Lansa. It couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. And yet--he was sure he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">that same mutilated hand thrust out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleeve of a green robe an hour before!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lansing was still talking as he bent over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the improvised map.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's the line of the Giri River. Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to cross by the bald gray hill, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear west-six-north, using Venusian mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netic bearings. After that ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He suddenly stopped and looked up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching Gerry's grim glance fixed on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand. Hastily he jerked it aside into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadows. He must have read in Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ry's eyes that his move had been too late,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his own gaunt face hardened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You rat!1' Gerry hissed between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. His right hand shot out, clutching</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the other man's throat, but Lansing</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted aside and jerked a dark object</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his pocket. An instant later a sting-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cloud of the paralysis gas took Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the face, and he fell limply to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lansing straightened up and tossed aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flask that had held the gas. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a savage gleam in his narrow eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Norton," he said, "we'll do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it the other way. Ho--guards!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A gong sounded in the corridor, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsating green light immediately flooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cell. Scaly-skinned guards swarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and saluted. Lansing ripped off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn uniform, revealing a tight-fitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">green garment beneath it, and one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards helped him on with the cowled robe</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had worn before. He glanced down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bring him and the others up to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he recovers the use of his muscles,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BY the time Gerry Norton recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the effects of the gas he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been securely bound again. Two guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">led him to the end of a corridor and up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flight of stairs to the level above. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also part of the prison zone of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">castle, but built in an entirely different</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. Walls and floor were of a pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished green metal. Super-charged elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronic locks fastened each door, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">death for anyone who attempted to tamper</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them. Metal globes gave a steady light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mirrors above each cell door gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards who lounged in the corridors a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete view of the inside of every cell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, Gerry realized, was actually the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison used by the lords of Giri-Vaaka.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been placed in the old and aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doned dungeons beneath as part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme to lure him into calling the Viking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her doom. Glancing in the door-mirrors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cells as he went by, Gerry saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the occupants were men and wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of the Green Race of Giri, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair number of Golden Amazons and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few reptile men who had been guilty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some crime or infraction of discipline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw Closana! The girl was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly spread-eagled against one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished metal walls of her cell, her out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched wrists and ankles held by steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuffs. Gerry's jaw jutted stubbornly for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and for a moment he twisted help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly against the cords that held his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guards halted before a door deep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior of the palace, where a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaly warriors stood on guard with gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns cocked and ready. The opening it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self was not closed by any door, but by</seg><seg type="columnLine">what looked like a tightly stretched curtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some transparent green material. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer inspection he saw that it glowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a steady pulsation, while occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">specks of green fire ran through it. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the guards moved incautiously back</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the tip of his scabbard touched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green glow filling the door, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackling hiss. The tip of the scabbard</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply vanished. It was as though it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cleanly cut off by a very sharp knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A challenge came from within, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Gerry's guards shouted a reply. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">green glow suddenly vanished from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway. Whatever elemental force it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that blocked the passage had been with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn, and they walked freely in through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE wide room before them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">walled with slabs of polished black</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble. The figures of writhing snakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rearing reptiles were inlaid into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black walls with some iridescent green</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. Their eyes were inlaid jewels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thin trails of pungent smoke drifted up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward from their nostrils. A low and throb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing music, full of the thunder of muted</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums, came from unseen source. At reg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular intervals around the walls stood tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden standards with glowing globes atop</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the throne room of Lansa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord of Giri-Vaaka, who had once been</seg><seg type="columnLine">an officer in the flying forces of Earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man himself sat on a black marble</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne with a dozen of the higher officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his scaly warriors grouped around him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These Inner Guards wore breast-plates and</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmets of a bright green metal, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed ears protruded upward through</seg><seg type="columnLine">twin openings in the sides of the helmets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lansa's swarthy face was gloatingly tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphant. It had always been Gerry Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's private opinion that Walter Lansing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slightly mad. Brilliant in many ways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but definitely unstable. At last he appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have slipped over that shadowy border</seg><seg type="columnLine">that divides the rational from the insane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''It is unfortunate that my little scheme</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to have you summon your space-ship here</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not work," Lansa said in English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But we will find some other way of per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suading you to do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You think you're quite the little tin</seg><seg type="columnLine">god, don't you?" Gerry sneered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am a god--to these people," Lansa re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied quietly. "Though the Stardust was</seg><seg type="columnLine">damaged too badly to return to earth, little</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her equipment was harmed except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocket tubes themselves. Within six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months after landing I had made myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">master of these primitive but obedient peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple. The submarine that brought you</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the city of Larr shows what can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done with them. In the meantime I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicated with friends on Earth by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of a secret radio frequency, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for the sending of the next space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off as a door behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne opened and a woman came into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. It was Olga Stark, now wearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long gown of shimmering green. Metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">strands of the same color were braided into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her dark hair, which was crowned by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circlet bearing the design of a rearing ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pent. All the officers and courtiers lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arms in salute. The woman walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and stood beside Lansa's throne, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down at Gerry with a cold and imper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal scorn. It had not taken Olga Stark</seg><seg type="columnLine">very long to fit herself into the role of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen of Giri-Vaaka!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A NUMBER of things were clear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry Norton now! It had been Olga</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stark with whom Lansing had secretly</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicated after he made himself mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of the Scaly Ones, and that explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">her insistent requests to join the expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Again, it had been Olga who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been surreptitiously using the radio to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Lansing that day when Gerry had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into the radio room on hearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hum of the generator. They had been ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranging the details of his abduction. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">--who was Olga's confederate who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked him over the head when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked in on than that time? There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still some traitor on board the Viking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have now developed the resources of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this country to the point where the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">campaign is ready," Lansa boasted, "all</seg><seg type="columnLine">these reptile men needed was a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient brains and initiative to lead them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We are making ray-tubes, modeled on those</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the Stardust, and will soon be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blast down the guardian forts of Sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vissa and to conquer those few other por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of this planet that still stand against</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Then I will return to the Earth in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your Viking, taking with me enough gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">to buy a vast fleet of ships. There is more</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold available here on Venus than all your</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks on Earth have ever imagined! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make myself ruler of Earth with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that gold, but I will choose another</seg><seg type="columnLine">method. I will bring back the space-ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and load them up with my scaly warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and then sail to conquer the Outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planets and whatever else may lie beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Solar System!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry Norton stared at Lansa in a grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. The man was undoubtedly mad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stark, raving mad! No one but a maniac</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cherish such a wild dream of Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versal conquest. He had that dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">combination of natural cleverness and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted values that has often distinguished</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaders who have taken nations into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy valleys of ruin. For a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lansa hesitated, his narrow eyes blazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one 'arm flung up in a dramatic ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. Then some of the fire went out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and he returned to more prosaic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But all that lies in the future. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I must ask you to radio-phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Viking to come to this city and land</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the plain just below the walls."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll see you in hell first!" Gerry snapped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lansa shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I expected you to indulge in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">such heroics! Your type always does. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not forgotten your attacks on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation back on Earth some years ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton, nor your charges that I was unfit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to command the Stardust. It will give me</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable pleasure to watch what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to happen to you. Ho--guards!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bring him down to the torture chamber."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE place of torture was a circular and</seg><seg type="columnLine">low vaulted chamber. Gerry was led</seg><seg type="columnLine">across to one of the walls, and his bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands fastened behind him to a metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. The place was lit by a dim green</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that had no visible source, though in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one spot there was a ruddy glow where</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">irons were heating in a brazier of burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">charcoal. A bench was placed for Lansa</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Olga to sit on, and four of their guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood beside them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The torturers themselves had been se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected from among the Green Men of Giri,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of the scaly skinned warrior race</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Vaaka. They were squat and heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, those torturers, evidently of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutal and debased type that Lansa had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to find. One in particular, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide green face was made hideous by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old scar that had put out one of his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">licked his thick lips in ghoulish anticipation</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his fingers prodded the flesh about Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ry's ribs and felt the Earth-man's muscles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bring in the other two," Lansa com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All about the room were the tools of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torturers art. Some were familiar things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that have been used since men first began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mistreat his fellow creatures--leaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">whips and stretching-racks and cradles lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pointed spikes. Others were strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking and probably even more horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanisms of coils and wires and elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trodes. Gerry licked his lips. The place had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hushed stillness of a chamber that has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been thoroughly sound-proofed. Probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">no screams of agonized victims ever pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated beyond those smooth walls of pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished green metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They brought Angus McTavish in first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked like some shaggy red giant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing only a loin-cloth with his hair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard all awry. Then came Closana. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed wrists were tied together before</seg><seg type="columnLine">her by a cord that was held by one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, and she was very pale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lansa nodded quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let them begin," said Lansa tonelessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A suggestion, sir!" Olga leaned forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bench. The glance of her brooding</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes was fixed on the young Amazon prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess. "Let them work on the girl first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It will probably succeed more quickly. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think the man Norton has fallen in love</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that empty headed young savage, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know how men are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right. Let it be done that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closana was spread-eagled in mid-air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her upstretched arms fastened to ropes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to the ceiling and her ankles lashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal rings in the floor below. She could</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">move nothing but her head as Olga Stark</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked up to stand before her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This will repay for the condescension</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which I was treated in Savissa!" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth-woman said venomously. Closana</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at her in silence for a moment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then suddenly spat squarely in the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Atta girl!" roared Angus with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of his big lungs. Olga struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless girl twice in the muuth with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched fist, then returned to her seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Begin!" she commanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the torturers tossed Closana's</seg><seg type="columnLine">long hair forward on either side of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, to leave her back entirely bare for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lash. The girl's eyes were closed again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was a thin trickle of blood at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one corner of her mouth. The torturer</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook out the lash, whirled it once through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, and then brought it smashing across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of Closana's back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE girl's whole body writhed convul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sively for a moment. There was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant red welt where the whip had struck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A low moan escaped between her clenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. Then Gerry Norton leaned forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he stood bound against the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You win, Lansing!" he said hoarsely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"stop it!

Olga set up the sigmoid antenna</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its duralite frame, and twisted the dials</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the space-ship's wave length. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the transmitter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Calling Steve Brent on the Viking!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calling Steve Brent on the Viking!

For perhaps an hour they rested and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eased their stiffened muscles. Then more</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards came and bound their hands behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and took them away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was again broad daylight when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were taken out into the streets of the city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peculiarly yellow daylight that filtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the cloudy canopy overhead. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">three prisoners were surrounded by a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard of reptile men who marched them</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the city and out through a gate in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the far wall. Here a broad plain swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the waters of a saffron colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake, a sheet of water so vast that its far</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore was no more than a dun line along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon. A sort of grandstand had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been erected along one side of the plain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''I think I begin to understand the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this little game!" McTavish muttered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squinting as he peered ahead, "and I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancy the idea at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't get what you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McTavish snorted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Did ye never see a piece of cheese in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mouse-trap?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Gerry himself began to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, On a broad platform before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandstand stood a line of men armed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas-guns. Some were gray scaled officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fighting forces, and others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dandified Green Men of the decadent</seg><seg type="columnLine">minority that had fawned upon and min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled with their conquerers. In the flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and marshy expanse of the plain before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them there had been driven a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">short but heavy stakes like tent pegs, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a metal ring set in the top. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were long rows of them. Gray scaled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">guards were busy fettering prisoners to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pegs, making them fast by tying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal ring the other end of the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord with which their hands were tied be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind them. The hunters and the audience</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ready, the bait was being prepared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closana was a few feet away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry, fastened to the next stake. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood erect, her shoulders drawn back by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strain of her bonds and her long hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowing in the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the end, Geree," she said, "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">not today, then tomorrow or the next day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the tale told in Larr of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens to the prisoners of the Scaly Ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I never believed it till now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE were sixty or eighty prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened in the field to serve as bait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the giant dakta. About half were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Golden Amazons captured in various raids.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The remainder were men and women of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Green People of Giri, prisoners con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demned to death hy the grim and ruthless</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribunals of the Scaly Ones. Now a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">attendants carrying leather buckets ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down the lines of the captives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashing each victim with a dipper full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a purple colored and very pungent oil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now what's the game?" Gerry mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. Angus bent his head to sniff at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy liquid trickling down his hairy chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It smells like a harlot's dream!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered sourly, "probably intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make us more attractive to whatever kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of creature it is that's coming after us!",</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The attendants had hurried away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their buckets of oil, and now the crowds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the grandstand and on the plain settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to wait. They were in holiday mood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing and talking in their shrill voices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a black dot appeared high up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. A murmur of anticipation ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the crowd. The dakta came plum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meting earthward as its super-keen senses</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw and smelled the attractive bait wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing below. The thing, as it came near, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like some figment from a night-mare. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a reptilian body between a twenty-foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread of leathery wings, and a long beak</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a double row of pointed teeth. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the things that Gerry had seen flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">over that lonely sea when he first brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Viking down through the canopy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds that covered the planet of Venus!</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS	29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that is a dakta!" Angus muttered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"bonny little creature!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The winged lizard checked its flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily some ten feet off the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly above one of the captive' Ama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zons. Then he dove down. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed and twisted away to the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her tether, and the toothed beak just</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed her. The first of the hunters fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the dakta whirled and lashed out again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the bullet exploded off to one side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gripping the writhing Amazon with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">beak and his clawed feet, the dakta flapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his great wings and soared upward again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two more of the hunters fired together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the explosive bullets missed en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely, the other blew one of the girl's legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pieces but did not harm the monster that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Lansa tossed aside his green robe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood up. Gerry saw that he held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray-tube, either one from the Stardust or</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the new ones he now claimed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to make in Giri-Vaaka. The tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">slanted upward. Murky light played</seg><seg type="columnLine">around its muzzle. The dakta gave a shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost human scream. Then it dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">its mangled victim and fell twitching to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. Its leathery skin was turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">black where the ray-blast had struck it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along the edge of the field, the close packed</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds broke into wild cheering and Lansa</seg><seg type="columnLine">acknowledged it with a condescending ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of one upraised arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hunt went on. Sometimes the dakta</seg><seg type="columnLine">came singly, sometimes in pairs. The hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers had the range better now, and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">them consistently. On several occasions</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying lizards were brought down be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they had time to seize a victim at all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but most of the time one of the prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">was killed or mortally wounded before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dakta was slain. A Green Man tethered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stake next beyond Closana had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripped about the throat by the raking teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a dakta's bill, and was breathing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of gurgling moan as he bled to death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So far, that was the nearest that one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying lizards had come to Gerry or his</seg><seg type="columnLine">two companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Gerry saw the thing for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been watching. There was a streak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire along the eastern horizon. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast of speeding rocket tubes! A cigar</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped hull of gleaming blue and silver</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came streaking across the saffron sky with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trail of smoke behind it. The Viking</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SWELLING uproar came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds which began to mill about in</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion. Lansa had risen to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was peering upward with one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised to shade his eyes. Yellow flames</seg><seg type="columnLine">played about the Viking's bow as the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse rockets checked her momentum. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of swooping dakta veered away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, then dropped down toward the bait</seg><seg type="columnLine">tethered below. One of them was headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight for Angus McTavish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Instantly one of the forward ray-guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the space-ship glowed into life, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winged lizard crumpled in mid-flight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry knew then that someone on board</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been looking down through the pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erful viewing glasses, and had recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and Angus. He shouted hoarsely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing he would not be heard but unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Drums were throbbing a swift alarm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the milling crowds were in wild con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion. Companies of the scaly warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were firing by volley, but the explosive</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets only flashed harmlessly against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Viking's duralite hull. Some of the heavier</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas-guns set on the battlements above</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed into life then, but even the larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">caliber explosives could make no impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion on tempered duralite. With her ray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns flashing and ripping black swathes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the scaly ranks below, with her heli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">copters spinning to take the strain as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast of the rockets died away, the Viking</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled rapidly groundward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "By Lord, Steve came a-fightin'!" Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tavish roared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, you old goat!" Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted back, "did you really think I'd call</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship into a trap? You're as bad as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that maniac who calls himself Lansa. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that if I spoke too strongly of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">nice fellows these scaly devils are, Steve</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have the sense to know that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">under pressure and in a trap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then came swift disaster! Over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the nearest black and battle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented wall of Lansa's palace thrust the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle of a large caliber ray-gun. Steve</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brent saw it, too, and tried to lift the nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his ship to bring his own guns to bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on this new menace, but he was too late.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The muzzle of the ray-gun on the battle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments glowed dully, the blast of the supode-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays struck the row of spinning helicopters</seg><seg type="columnLine">on top of the Viking's hull. The blades</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big propellors went spinning into</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, their shafts bent and crumpled like</seg><seg type="columnLine">straws in a gale. Robbed of their sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port, essential when lacking rocket power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of at least 300 miles per hour, the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship plunged downward like a falling star.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She struck the waters of the lake with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty splash. Spray dashed as high as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls of Lansa's castle, and when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone the space-ship had vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GERRY NORTON stood motionless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was staring at the muddy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">foam flecked waters of the lake, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spreading ripples that still beat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore as the effect of that mighty splash</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsided. At the moment he felt old and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired and defeated, his brain numbed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Viking was gone! Freckled Steve Brent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the cheerful Portok, and all the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them were gone. Buried deep in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddy bottom of a Venusian lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second expedition from Earth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this cloud-veiled and ill-fated planet had</seg><seg type="columnLine">also ended in disaster. In the future the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Viking would be classed with the Stardust</seg><seg type="columnLine">--simply another luckless space-ship that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed away into the void and vanished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The men of her crew and what they tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accomplish would be forgotten, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">names would only remain on some yellow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing record buried in the maze of govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment files. So deep was CJerry Norton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter brooding that he scarcely heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words Angus McTavish was shouting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, Gerry lad! Let's get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">while there's all this confusion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVER since they had been brought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this field beside the lake, Angus had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been working at his bonds. He was a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong man anyway, and the swell of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly muscles was far greater than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of any of the races that the Scaly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones were accustomed to making prison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers. While the attention of all the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">was absorbed in the appearance and sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequent wreck of the Viking, Angus had</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to snap his own bonds and was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">now unhurriedly freeing Gerry's wrists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry ran to Closana and untied her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, while Angus freed the nearest other</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner who was a stocky and broad shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered Green Man with a heavily lined face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As soon as his hands were free, the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled to face them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My thanks, hiziren!" he panted, "now</seg><seg type="columnLine">go while you can. You are more easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">spotted in a crowd than I. Hurry! I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">free as many of these others as possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Get into the city, and try to reach the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">men call 'The Square of the Dragon.' Say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Sarnak sent you. Hurry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even though he was carrying Closana</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his arms, Gerry's Earthly muscles al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him to run in mighty six-foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounds. Angus went leaping along before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. So great was the confusion that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were half way across the plain to the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">before anyone noticed them at all. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shouting officer of the Scaly Ones threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in front of them with his drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big engineer roared like an angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">bull, and leaped clean over the man. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the scaly warrior could turn the Scot</seg><seg type="columnLine">had him from behind. An instant later</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angus had the sword and was racing ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the Venusian lay sprawled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud with his neck broken and his long</seg><seg type="columnLine">head twisted grotesquely awry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The hal f dozen guards posted in the arch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gate stared indecisively at the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinned trio racing toward them. Angus</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a sword in each hand by this time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he leaped at the guards with a shout. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitive broke through the line of swords-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men by sheer momentum and dashed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city. There was no pursuit. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the panic stricken throng rushing back</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the shelter of the city reached the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment later, and the guards were</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamped by a jostling mob of mingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scaly Ones and Green Men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry and his two companions darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the nearest of the many narrow alleys</seg><seg type="columnLine">that twisted about this part of the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They dodged from one dingy thoroughfare</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the next. When they met a woman of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Green People, Gerry unceremoniously</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore off her robe and shielding veil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung them to Closana to hide her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">tawny skin and golden hair. Later, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and Angus had also disguised them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">selves in the rough garments worn by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poorer folk of this city of Vaaka-hausen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were able to walk quietly down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets without fear of detection unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">they met a patrol at dose range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last they came to a dingy plaza that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surrounded by ramshackle buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great age. It had probably once been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prosperous and fashionable part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, centuries ago, before the Scaly Ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">overran the land of Giri. Now grass grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">up between the paving stones, and the roofs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dingy buildings sagged close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking point, and piles of festering rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bish lay along the gutters. The place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slum of the sort that had not existed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more enlightened planets of Earth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars for many generations. A canal</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed along one side of the square, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center of the plaza stood the eroded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ancient black marble statue of a rear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dragon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This must be the place!" Angus mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered from the shadows of the hood that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had drawn up over his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS they hesitated, a few people peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">furtively out at them from the broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows and sagging doors of the houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the square. Then a man came to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward them. He was bent and crippled, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beggar wearing filthy rags. His matted</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair hung down over his eyes, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole body seemed covered with the caked</seg><seg type="columnLine">filth of one who had never thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">washing. As the man came forward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of limping shuffle, Gerry instinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively laid his hand on the hilt of the sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">he carried concealed under his cloak, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Closana drew the concealing veil more</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely over her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alms, hisiren! A little charity of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">generosity!" the beggar whined as he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What place is this?" Gerry asked, try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to give his voice the soft tone and lisp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing accent characteristic of the Green Men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beggar limped a little closer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered up into the shadows of Gerry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood. What he saw seemed to satisfy</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take your hand from your sword hilt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend!" he said in a low voice quite unlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">his previous whine, "what place do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Place of the Dragon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is it. Who sent you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sarnak sent us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is good." The beggar pointed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flight of worn stone steps that led to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canal whose surface was some eight or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet below the level of the plaza. "Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down there, below the bridge, and tap on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone that bears a rusted iron ring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will find friends. Go quickly, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are no strangers to observe you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">''Do you trust that man ?" Angus whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered in English as they turned away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got to. It's- our only chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">We're too easy to recognize, in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these clothes, to stay free in this city for</seg><seg type="columnLine">long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black waters of the canal flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sluggishly along between slimy stone walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Refuse drifted on the surface. The water</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself had a foul and penetrating odor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry walked down the steps, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the walk that stretched beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water at one edge of the canal until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was under an arch that served as a bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to support the street above. The arch was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide enough so that they were now com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely hidden from the view of anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the plaza above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On one of the stones of the arch, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the height of his shoulder, Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a rusted iron ring. He tapped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stone with the hilt of his sword. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a faint click, and though there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no visible change in the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitted stone wall before him he heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered question:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who knocks?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friends," Gerry replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who sent you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sarnak sent us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a low, metallic jingle. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of the wall about the height of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and some three feet wide swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly inward. As soon as the three of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them had stepped through the opening into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small room that was built in the interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the arch, the door swung shut behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE were half a dozen men in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">low roofed and stone walled chamber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All were of the Green People, dressed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged beggars but with the bearing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">32	PL.4UVET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of warriors. Drawn steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed in their hands. Their faces were</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy with suspicion.

Hastily Gerry told the tale of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dakta hunt and of their subsequent escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So Sarnak got away I" the leader of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Green Men exulted. "Ho! That is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best news that we of the Dragon's Teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">have heard in many weeks 1 All right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slag, take these strangers through to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner places."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the Green Men beckoned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry to follow him down a narrow flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steps at the back of the room. It ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a circular pool of water like a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, the steps going on down below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface. Their guide opened a cupboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">built into the wall and took out four glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmets. The helmets were attached to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather pads that fitted tightly about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and chest, with straps to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in place. A cylindrical metal tank</seg><seg type="columnLine">was attached to the back of each helmet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a tube that led to a valve at the side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The guide also took out some heavily leaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put on these helmets and then open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valves," he explained, "then follow me</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the steps. Be careful not to fall in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness. After w^ get around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first bend in the corridor below there will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry put the globular glass helmet over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, opening the valve as soon as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had adjusted the straps. The air in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet immediately took on a faintly chem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical odor, but it was pleasant and in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">way oppressive. As soon as all of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ready, the man called Slag beckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then started down the steps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warm black water rose to Gerry's knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then to his waist. As it came up to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders he saw the top of Slag's helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappear below the surface ahead of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment the smooth surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was level with Gerry's eyes as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose around his own helmet. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped dow'n into a darkness as black and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">impenetrable as though he were immersed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry guided himself with his left hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the slime covered stones of the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him. He reached back with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand to steady Closana who was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. All together he counted thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, feeling carefully with his feet each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, before the floor leveled off. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall curved around to the right. Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed it, rounded a bend, and was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer in darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stood in a straight passage that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lined with blocks of polished stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Metal plates, set in the ceiling at regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals, glowed with a greenish-yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that was nearly as bright as the cloudy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusian daylight. The place was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely filled with water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an eerie sensation! Slag was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing a few feet ahead, grinning at them</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the glass of his helmet, but now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned and w'alked slowly down the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor. Gerry followed him, bent well for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward as he walked, forcing himself ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the resistance of the water. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">their movements were sluggish and slow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the heavily leaded sandals held them</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and gave their feet purchase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SMALL fishes swam past them along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage, their round eyes peering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the helmet glasses as they passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clumps of colored seaweed grew out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls and ceiling, their long streamers</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving gently in the slow currents set up</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the passage of the men. In spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brightness of the light from the ceiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates, the effect of the water made it dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficult to see far down the passage ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The outlines of Slag were clear enough as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he plodded along directly ahead of Gerry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but everything beyond him was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred and uncertain. It was like living</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a mirage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last they came to a point where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage branched. Here they passed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentry who wore a glass helmet and a tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitting green rubber uniform. On his chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the insignia of a rampant black dragon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was armed with a very thin, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle-like sword whose point was razor</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen. Gerry realized the reason for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarly designed weapon when the sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try swung his sword upward to salute their</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">guide. The blade was so thin that it of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered little resistance to the water, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of being quickly wielded made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">a far more effective weapon under water</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a heavier sword would have been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They passed more branching passages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more rubber-clad sentries who stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them curiously as they went by. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a whole network of corridors in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">underwater world! At last Slag opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">a metal door at the end of the particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage he had followed, and they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded into a small room. Slag closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and dogged it, then tapped on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass panel across the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A silvery flood of air bubbles came</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring out the end of a pipe that pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truded through the wall. At the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry heard the thud of heavy pumps start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to suck water through gratings at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the wall. The water level dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly. When it was down to their waists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slag took off his helmet and slipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaded sandals from his feet. He mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned to the others to do the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are about to enter the hidden realm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Luralla, the home of the Dragon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teeth!" he said. "If you can prove your</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to be here you will be welcome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Otherwise you will go back into one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these waterlocks--without any helmets on."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He grinned cheerfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE water dropped below the level of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door sills. The pumps sucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">noisly on the last few foaming inches for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, and then they ceased. The inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was opened by a sentry whose tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitting green uniform with its black dragon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made of dry cloth instead of dripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber. He wore a plumed metal helmet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carried a heavy sword instead of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thin water blades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come in, Slag," he said, "who are these</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were in a sort of guardroom, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">square chamber where glass water helmets</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in long rows on metal shelves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many weapons hung in racks on the walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The control levers of the pumps were just</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the left of the door. There were half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen uniformed men standing about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, one of them bearing the silver in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signia of an officer on his chest. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">3--Planet Stories--Winter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Slag had given a hasty account of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of Gerry and the others, the officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded toward an inner door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Prince Sarnak has just returned. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will find him in the great hall. Take these</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of music and laughter, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the confused babel of many voices, came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry's ears as soon as the far door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened. They entered a vast hall. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">low ceiled, as were all the water-locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">chambers of this strange place, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad and spacious. Heavy stone columns</seg><seg type="columnLine">carved like giant sea-horses supported the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof. Patterns of seaweed and star fish</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other denizens of the deep were inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled wth rearing dragons in the painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">designs along the walls. The room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with wide tables flanked by long</seg><seg type="columnLine">benches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men and women who sat at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables, or stood gossiping in noisy groups</seg><seg type="columnLine">in corners of the hall, were nearly all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Green People of Giri, but there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few escaped Golden Amazons who came</seg><seg type="columnLine">flocking eagerly around Closana. In out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward appearance these green skinned men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women were similar to the folk who</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived in the city overhead with their scaly</seg><seg type="columnLine">masters, but there was a subtle difference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These people had none of the cowed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjugated air of the citizens who lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">above ground. There was a different look</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their eyes, a more confident note in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices, a firmer set to their shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These folk had the air of free men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors, not slaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stocky and merry eyed man caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of them and came striding across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall. It was Sarnak, the man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been tethered next to them in the field of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dakta hunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Welcome to the halls of Luralla!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">boomed, "we are glad to have you come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the hidden realm of the Dragon's Teeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hizlren and comrades, these are the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">landers from afar who freed me this after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon so that I and a dozen more of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">people escaped death at the hands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scaly Ones!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thrice hail!" roared the crowd, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred blades flashed in the golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Angus McTavish rung the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his dripping beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These look like men of spirit," he rum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">34	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bled cheerfully, "I think I'm going to enjoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A LITTLE later, wearing dry clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three of them sat down with Sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nak and his officers at a table in the comer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hall. Young girls brought them</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes of fried sea-urchins, and broiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaks of the grappa fish, and other savory</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We who call ourselves the Dragon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teeth are outlaws descended from out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws," Sarnak explained. "Our ancestors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were men and women who never acknowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged the rule of the Scaly Ones when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they overran this once pleasant land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Giri. I was born in this hidden place, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">was my father before me and his father</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. We live here in the water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked Halls of Luralla, and harass the ty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rants in what ways we can, and try to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive the traditions and glory of the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">days when the Dragon Kings ruled in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">city and the Scaly Ones were still lurking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their Vaaka marshes to the westward."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Does Lansa know of this place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He knows that the Dragon's Teeth ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ist, as all rulers of the Scaly Ones have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known it, but the location of our hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">place has never been betrayed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," roared Angus, pounding his big</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist on the table till the dishes rattled, "why</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you revolt? I'll go with you myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to strike a blow against those reptile</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinned devils up above!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Count me in, too!" Gerry said quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angus' voice had boomed out through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big hall. It was answered by a lilting</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout as men sprang to their feet. Hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of sword blades flashed clear of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">scabbards. Only Sarnak himself remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated, slowly shaking his head. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a twisted smile on his broad and heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily lined face. His eyes held bitterness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would only be pointless suicide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiziren!" he said grimly. "We number</seg><seg type="columnLine">only about a thousand all together, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted men oi the Dragon's Teeth, against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the countless thousands of Lansa's scaly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hordes. It would be different if our coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trymen up above could be inspired to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass uprising, but the time is not yet. Too</seg><seg type="columnLine">long have they lived under the rule of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tyrants. They are cowed. They have lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">their spirit, and some of the younger ones</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have even become fawning satellites of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conquerors! I f there comes a day when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forces of the Scaly Ones are engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some major war along the frontier, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this suggested assault upon the barrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts of Savissa that Lansa is said to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">planning, then we may be able to do some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. For the present we must continue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lie hidden and bide our time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry Norton was uncertain about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own course. Now that the Viking and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew had been lost, with all hope of a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to Earth cut off, he felt hopelessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">adrift. Sarnak urged his visitors to stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Luralla. The place was a remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineering feat, completely under water</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with its air constantly re-conditioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and preserved, but Gerry felt restless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cramped there. Though the outlaws car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried on a constant guerilla warfare with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Scaly Ones, it was all on a small scale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry felt that he would rather return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savissa, where at least the people were</seg><seg type="columnLine">free and the Amazon warriors kept cease-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less watch on their frontiers. Closana, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, was very anxious to return home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suits me, too," Angus rumbled, "in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that country they at least show a proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect for a man of my attainments."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Meaning your whiskers?" Gerry asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look out, Angus," Closana warned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smile, idly running her slender fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the keen edge of her dagger. "Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savissan princess will choose you for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband as I have chosen Geree here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you we wouldn't talk about that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the present. . . ." Gerry began. Clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ana's hand moved swiftly as a striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">dakta. The keen blade bit through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth of Gerry's sleeve and pinned it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''You'll never get away from me, Geree,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl said quietly. Angus McTavish</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst out in a great roar of laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Might as well admit you're licked now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad! These Venusian women seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">verra strong minded lassies!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY started two days later. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, of course, neither night nor day</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sub-aqueous halls of Luralla but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaws ran their lives on a normal sched-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ule. Sarnak supplied Gerry and the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rubber uniforms and complete equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment including the thin bladed water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">swords in the long feathery scabbards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will have you guided out to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our exits that is a quarter mile off shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the place where the dakta hunt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">held," Sarnak offered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought that water was a lake," Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. Sarnak shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. It is an estuary, an arm of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Sea.

"Well--you had better</seg><seg type="columnLine">start. May the Dragon Gods be with you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They strapped on their helmets and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justed the valves. A uniformed guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into the water-lock with them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sarnak shook hands, saluted, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back through the door which</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed behind him. The guide lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand in a signal, and a second later a tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent of water rushed out of the gratings</seg><seg type="columnLine">to foam about their feet. They were ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave Luralla!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again they went through the maze of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-filled passages, passing occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentries. After a while the character of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corridor changed. It was wider, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was arched instead of square, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a carpet of soft natural sand beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet instead of a stone floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We come to the last outpost of Lu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ralla, hiziren 1" the guide said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stepped out of the end of the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage and found themselves in the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea, many fathoms down. A broad and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly sloping floor of smooth sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">studded with lumps of coral and clusters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sea-weed stretched before them. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">were giant ferns stretching twelve and fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen feet high, others were low and sponge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like growths. A school of tiny red fishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot swiftly past them. Larger fish sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">majestically by overhead. The top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was a gleaming golden ceiling far</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">above them, the greenish yellow light les-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sening in intensity as it came down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The end of the passage was surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a barrier of piled coral. Outlaw swords-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men stood on guard, also armed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of compressed air cross-bow that shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">a heavy metal needle with great force. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corral at one side an orderly brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">three saddle-dolphins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big fish were equipped with rubber</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddles strapped around the body, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">short stirrups. They were guided by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridle similar to that used on Earthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses. As Gerry swung up to the saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dolphin bucked once or twice with quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">flips of his tail, then steadied down as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the tight pressure of his master's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees. When the other two were mounted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officer commanding the outpost lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm in salute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Dragon Gods be with you!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. At a distance of fifteen or twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet the sound of his voice was slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">muted, but the words were perfectly clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ear-pieces of Gerry's helmet. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his own rubber gloved hand to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">globular helmet and returned the salute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY rode off at an easy pace, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dolphins rising above the tops of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tallest vegetation. Gerry found that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy to sit the saddle as long as he bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little forward to overcome the resistance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the water against his chest. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about thirty or forty feet down. On Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a depth would have been uncomfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, but the lighter gravity of Venus made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it easily bearable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry glanced back. Closana was riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few feet behind him, slender and erect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlling her restless dolphin as easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though she had been accustomed to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeds all her life. Angus was grinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadly through his globular glass helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he sat astride a particularly big dolphin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swung his light bladed water-sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">from side to side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If any of our friends back on Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see us now in some sort of an astral</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectroscope," the big Scot cried, "they'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">think themselves crazy. Maybe this is only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nightmare at that! Do you think we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake up soon and find ourselves safe back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on board the Viking?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">36	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid not," Gerry answered. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered in what part of this vast sea the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted hulk of the Viking was now lying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All day they rode, roughly following the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoreline to the northward. Whenever it</seg><seg type="columnLine">got so deep that nothing was visible below</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a vast green shadow Gerry headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">inland until the tops of the sea gardens</seg><seg type="columnLine">again came into view. Sarnak had told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them that by the middle of the next day</seg><seg type="columnLine">it should be safe for them to come above</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and check their maps and put fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical cartridges in the cylinders of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmets. The Scaly Ones patrolled their</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast line in shallow open boats, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not go beyond their own borders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once Gerry checked his dolphin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then headed downward as he caught sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of something big and dark lying on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. The others followed him. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broken and rusting hulk of a space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, a vessel of a strange type with a name</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an unknown tongue still visible on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered stern. The wreck must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for a very long time, for the sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heaped high about it and sea-weeds</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew up through the open hatches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leaping ray-blasts!" McTavish said</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. "Yon craft never came from either</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth or Mars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably from some far distant planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in outer space that we've never heard of,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry said. "Some adventurous wanderer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the interstellar regions who came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grief in this lonely spot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was desolate and forlorn, the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that wrecked vessel from so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. It made Gerry think of his own lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">command. There were clean picked white</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones of strange shape lying about on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. Gerry saluted, a tribute to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange and forgotten wanderers of space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then urged his dolphin to a higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">level again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the dimming light showed that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dusk above the water they rode in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four-fathom shallows and halted iti a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth patch of yellow sand. Gerry un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddled the dolphins and tethered them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumps of coral where they browsed con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentedly on the short vegetation. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three exiles sat down in a circle on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. McTavish stretched his long legs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bouncing a few feet off the ground as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">did so and then floating slowly down again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll never forget this journey if I live</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be older than the whole Solar System</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself 1" he said. "Also--I'm hungry."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's nothing we can do about that</seg><seg type="columnLine">until noon tomorrow," Gerry grunted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe the fasting will make you lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of that surplus bulk of yours. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll admit I could do with some of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">special coffee Portok used to brew in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward room on the Viking in the evenings."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'd give a lot for a drink of plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">water," Closana said wistfully. "Acres of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water around us and nothing to drink!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the last of the light was gone they</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit a small lamp that Sarnak had given them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It illumined a circle some twenty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">across, a little patch of light in the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the utter blackness of the depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea. They sat there talking for a while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Gerry stretched out on the sand with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one arm hooked around a lump of coral</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold himself in place. He was thankful</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the waters of Venus were always</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm. It would scarcely have been pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to sleep at the bottom of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth's oceans in this manner, even with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the equipment with which Sarnak had sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a while Gerry drowsed. The audi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phones of his helmet picked up all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint sounds of this watery world. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">muffled splash as Angus McTavish stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">restlessly ... the steady movement as</seg><seg type="columnLine">their drowsing but apparently sleepless</seg><seg type="columnLine">dolphins fed on the fields of sea-weed . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">an occasional steady churning as some</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger denizen of the deep swam past above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Then he slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was well past midnight by the illumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated dial of the waterproof chronom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eter that Sarnak had given Gerry when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">awoke. Angus was shaking his shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light had been put out hours before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was no illumination at all except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an occasional flash of green phos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phoresence where some fish sped by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Either I'm an overgrown sponge," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big engineer muttered, "or there's a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining through the water off to the west."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry yawned and sat up, instinctively</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting to rub is eyes before his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">bumped against the hard glass surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his curving helmet. Some of the bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">coral around them glowed with an eerie</seg><seg type="columnLine">green radiance, and a tall frond of sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weed had tiny specks of light on the tips</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its constantly waving leaves. Then, far</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to the left, Gerry caught a faint glow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was hard to tell what kind of a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was, so great was the refraction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, but there was something there. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was little more than a lessening of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep gloom that otherwise surrounded them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all sides. Gerry got to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up his rubber saddle which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been using as a pillow under his helmet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'd better investigate," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wake Closana."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They saddled their dolphins and rode out</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an easy pace, holding the big fish down</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a tight rein. As they rode the glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of them became more definite. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to come from a long row of twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more lights. Then they were near</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough -to see each other in the reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's some kind of a ship," Gerry said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Those lights are her port holes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's more than that!" snapped Angus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's the Viking! I know the lines of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern anywhere, even in this sunken and</seg><seg type="columnLine">God forsaken spot!1'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The space-ship lay quietly in the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud of this part of the ocean bottom. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">her port holes of transparent duralite were</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing with the reflected light from in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. The twisted wrecks of her helicop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters were still visible on top of the hull,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but otherwise she did not appear to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">damaged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry was in the middle as the three of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them rode their dolphins up close to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big windows of the control room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ship had evidently survived the fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water, for they could see dim fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures moving about inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you that duralite hull could stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">u little thing like a fall into the ocean!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTavish exulted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they crowded their finny steeds close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the glass of the control room window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portok the Martian came to peer out. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">red skinned face went pale as he saw them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even through the ship's hull their au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diphones picked up his agonized cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steve! Tanda! I just saw the ghosts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Norton and McTavish looking in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steve Brent came into the control room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked haggard and unshaven, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stained with oily grease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you raving about, Portok?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's no raving, Steve!" the little Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian chattered, "I tell you I saw the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them.

Steve Brent</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped, but he walked to the window. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">own eyes widened as he saw the strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad trio sitting their mounts outside. Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved violently to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us in, you idiot!" he shouted, for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting that the Viking did not carry any</seg><seg type="columnLine">audiphones that could pick up his words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He heard Steve's unsteady voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe we're both crazy, Portok, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think they're really out there. Open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer door to the starboard space-lock."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SMALL door swung open on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">starboard side of the Viking's blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silver hull. That small compartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">had really been designed for dropping ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects into the void of outer space, or for</seg><seg type="columnLine">testing the quality of the atmosphere on</seg><seg type="columnLine">any stray planetoids the Viking might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">visited on her journey across the vastness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of interplanetary space, but it would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a water-lock in this instance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry and the others dismounted from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their dolphins and let the reins hang. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gus gave his mount a slap on the flank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a flip of its tail the big fish wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swam off, and after a second the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed it.

Larry affectionately</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped the laminated duralite shell of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">38	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">space-ship. "She can stand more than be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dropped in the drink from a few hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet up.

She lay in the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a half submerged cigar, the yellowish</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripples lapping on the curved blue duralite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her superstructure. The twisted re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains of the shattered helicopters were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly stumps along the space-ship's sleek</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. A single rocket tube flamed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoked astern, its blast driving the vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the water at a good pace while</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wake smoked and bubbled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry Norton opened the duralite dome</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the upper control room and stepped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wet deck with a few of the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were well out on the great sea, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green hills of the Giri-Savissa border</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low smear along the horizon to star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board. This was the same lonely sea they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen when they first dropped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the clouds to Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vast and greenish-yellow waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">were broken by scattered islands, bare bits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rock that were dotted with blue moss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sea birds swooped about them. Lofty</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains on a distant shore were capped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with snow. In one or two places a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft of sunlight struck down through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief gap in the canopy of eternal clouds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but otherwise there was only that subdued</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and peculiarly golden light in which there</seg><seg type="columnLine">movd only a few oddly shaped birds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So much had happened since they first</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that lonely sea!

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have aged ten years since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day he brought the Viking down through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cloud screen. Well--the immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem was to get some suitable metal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">repair the smashed helicopters. The Vik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing might possibly get up into the air with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power of her rockets alone if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">beached her on a sloping shore with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose upward, but she could never come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down safely without helicopters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll hold her on this course a while,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry said. "In the morning we can strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and try to pick up the frontiers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savissa."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was just at dusk that they saw white</seg><seg type="columnLine">towers against the sky. They rose out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea as Gerry turned the Viking's blunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose toward them--the mighty battlements</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a vast city. Closana, who was standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on deck beside him at the time, rested her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on the rail and stared in utter amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it isn't possible, Geree!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped, "there isn't any civilization out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there on the islands of the Great Sea!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Could it be a mirage?" he suggested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A reflection of some Savissan city on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainland ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No." The girl shook her head.

We'll go</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer and get a better look."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was sunset, the unspectacular Venu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian sunset which was simply a swift les-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sening of the golden glow from the cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">veiled sky above. Lights were gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from most of the tall buildings of the tow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering city as the Viking drove toward it</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">through a quiet sea. Sea birds swooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">low about the ship's wake. The watchers</seg><seg type="columnLine">011 deck could see the low shore line of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island on which the city was built. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they heard distant bells, pleasant bells that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be chiming a farewell to the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a welcome to the night. And then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">red light flashed on top of the tallest build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and in an instant the entire city van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE minute the strange city had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly visible before them, its grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful towers agleam with lights as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">notched the sky. The next instant the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole place was gone. There was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight at all but a low shoreline. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as though a thick veil of concealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist had been suddenly drawn across be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the ship and the city. Only--the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear and without a trace of mist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry Walked across to the open dome of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper control room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cut rockets!" he snapped. "Get some</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of an anchor overboard. We'll just</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay right here off shore until morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's something queer going on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry and Steve Brent leaned on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail together, peering through the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the island. Nothing was visible in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faint phorphor-glow that marked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusian night, but they could just hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distant singing as of many voices lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in chorus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think happened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city so suddenly?" Steve asked. Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I suppose some mist hid it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There wasn't any mist," Steve said</seg><seg type="columnLine">flatly, "anyway--we could see the low hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">on shore just as clearly after the city dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared as before. Anyway. ..."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen!" Gerry interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now they could again hear the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bells coming across the water. Half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time the sound was swept away by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night breeze, half the time they could just</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear it. The bells were of many blended</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones and notes, an immense carillon. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were singing some outland melody that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of the surge of ocean breezes and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries of the sea birds. It rose, and swelled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and died away again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The city's there, all right," Gerry said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. "Though I can't imagine why we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">don't see any lights with the sound of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bells that close. But we'll see in the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell you there is no city," Closana</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, her voice troubled. "We have often</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed ships into these waters from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savissan coast, and we know that none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these Outer Isles are inhabited. What you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have heard must be the ghosts of the Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones, ancient phantoms speeding through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skies. There is a legend that the bells</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their phantom ships can sometimes be</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard off the coast at night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ghosts or no ghosts, we're going ashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the morning!" Gerry said stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bornly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL night the Viking rode to a crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchor that Angus had improvised</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some spare parts on board. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-ship's designers had never expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to lie in water. Most of the crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on deck as soon as it grew light</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to see. Ahead of them, less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a mile away, stretched a sandy shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed by a line of low hills. The island</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a wealth of the yellow vegetation typi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal of the mainland of Venus, so that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a more friendly appearance than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other specks of land which dotted the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sea and were only bare rock, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no sign of life. Certainly there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no trace of any city! There was not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">an indication of human habitation at all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the dawn-mists cleared away they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that another range of hills stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the horizon some miles behind. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenish-yellow slopes were clear and sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the cloudy sky beyond, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were located well in the rear of where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city had appeared to be in that hasty</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse the night before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ready the landing party!" Gerry com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded. "Full armor and equipment!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">They gently beached the space-ship on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sloping expanse of sand, running her</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose a little way up above the water level</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the light surf lapped her dripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides. Some giant crabs scurried away</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the beach in startled surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Want to go ashore, Angus?" Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked as McTavish's red bearded face came</seg><seg type="columnLine">up through an escape hatch. The big en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineer shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll just stay aboard here and brood</seg><seg type="columnLine">40	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over my broken helicopters, thanks. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">last trip ashore took care of all my wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derlust for the present."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry took half the vessel's crew with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, leaving the other half on guard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Closana went with the landing party. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">their armor gleaming in the golden light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray guns and other weapons ready, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramped up across the loose sand of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach. Beyond the shore line was firmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, a field of some low plants that</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew in orderly yellow rows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll swallow my ray-tube if this isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a field cultivated by man! Nature was</seg><seg type="columnLine">never that orderly." Steve Brent muttered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord knows! If we ever get those</seg><seg type="columnLine">helicopters fixed, I'm all for a quick return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Earth. This planet is certainly no peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful garden of Eden, and I've had pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">near all I want of it. Savissa was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">place I really liked. I wonder what's hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening there now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll know if anything very exciting</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns up," Steve said. "When we started</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on our search after you disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night, I left Tanda behind with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">portable radio to keep us posted. Sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured it was our base on Venus, and any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way there was always the chancc you might</seg><seg type="columnLine">wander back there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great planetoids--I just thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">something! As soon as we get hack to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship, remind me to radio Tanda to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rupin-Sang that the Scaly Ones had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to use the old sewers, and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must either block them off or place a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a mile they walked inland, across</seg><seg type="columnLine">those odd fields. The orderly rows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants stretched off to the horizon on bath</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides. And then they came to a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">level plain. The ground before them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange looking, so strange that Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">called a halt while he stared down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight slope at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MOST of the plain was of bare rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock that was absolutely smooth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">level without any sign of weathering at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. Along the outer edge it was pitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">at regular intervals by what looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallow wells a foot in diameter. Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">that zone were many excavations of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">sizes and shapes, all cut down into the solid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rock with the sides perfectly straight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth. Gerry took off his helmet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratched his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now what do you make of that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know what it looks like to me," Steve</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "It looks just like the foundations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a city--without the city. Those round</seg><seg type="columnLine">pits are the anchorages of the outer wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those square holes are the basements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall buildings. Only--somebody has lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole city away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're crazy!" Gerry growled. Steve</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe we all are! Anyway, I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take a look into one of those holes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steve walked quickly forward toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest of the round pits. Suddenly, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he reached the very edge of the zone</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bare rock, there was a dull clash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel. Something had seemed to pick Steve</seg><seg type="columnLine">up bodily and hurl him backward. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed flat on his back on the ground, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet bouncing off and rolling a few feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It hit me," he shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know." Steve sat up and rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. "Y' know, Chief, it really felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">more as though I'd just walked squarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a solid stone wall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has just occurred to me," Gerry said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, "that maybe that's exactly what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you did do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry walked forward cautiously, a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a time, one hand stretched out before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. When he reached a spot on line</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the place where Steve had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, his hand encountered something</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool and firm and smooth. It was like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of a highly polished stone wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or a sheet of heavy and invisible glass. lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran both his hands over it. The thing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuous and solid. There was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible to the eye, and he could see far</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of him across the strangely surfaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky plain, but there was an impenetrable</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier blocking the path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stepping hack a few feet, Gerry picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a pebble and tossed it upward. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone bounced sharply back as soon as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in line with the invisible barrier. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw the pebble higher and the same thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. There was something mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous and disquieting about the way the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">would soar up into the clear air--and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply bounce back from a point in space</seg><seg type="columnLine">where nothing at all was visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Magic!" Closana said nervously. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earth-men of the landing party had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn together in a compact group, ray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes ready and eyes alert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry moved back a few feet farther,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then hurled the stone forward and upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">as high as he could. This lime the pebble</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not bounce back. It simply vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thin air. And then, from somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">off in the emptiness of space above them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came the sound of a deep and mock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing laughter!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS though that first laugh had somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">eased the necessity for a carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">enforced silence, there came a whole burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unseen and eerie merriment. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a murmur of many voics. Then it died</seg><seg type="columnLine">away again. There was still nothing vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible, and the silence Was once more un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''For Lord's sake, let's get out of here!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portok gasped. "This place is ghost</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridden I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are no ghosts here, little red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced man!" boomed a voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound had seemed to come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere overhead. From the empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">void above, where there was nothing at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the cloud canopy was reached many</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of feet up. One of the Viking's</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew bared his teeth in a sudden panic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his ray-gun to fire blindly upward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before he could pull the trigger there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blinding blue flash and a crash like sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer thunder. Captive lightning! The ray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun flew from the man's hands and landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few feet away, its wooden stock badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">charred and its barrel a glowing mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let your weapons rest, for they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless here!" commanded that same boom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing voice from above. "Whence came ye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers in odd clothing who have trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eled in a ship like a blue whale? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do ye seek here in the Outer Isles?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry stepped forward, a few feet ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the group. He shouted that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scientific exploring party who had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Earth in a space-ship. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief period of silence, as though men con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulted in whispers. Then the voice called</seg><seg type="columnLine">him again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You there--the leader! The Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Elders will talk with you. Go fifty paces</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your right, to where there are two</seg><seg type="columnLine">white stones, and then come forward be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them. Do not be afraid. You will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be harmed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you going to take the chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief?" Steve whispered. Gerry nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll have to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About fifty yards to his right Gerry saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">two white stones. They were set some</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve or fifteen feet apart, on the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the invisible barrier. Gerry walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, turned left, and then walked squarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">in between the stones. He held one arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">protectingly in front of him, but this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand did not encounter any barrier. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead--he found himself standing under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arch-way of a gate with a mighty city</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread before him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE city had simply appeared in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash, with its mighty towers soaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the sky, as soon as he stepped over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer line of the arch. Whatever it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that held the place invisible from out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, it had ceased to function for him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as he came within the limits of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer surface of the walls. Glancing back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw that his companions were still star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blankly at the spot he had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">quitted. They were evidently unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see either him or any part of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right, Steve!" he shouted. "Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold everybody there till I come back."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doors of heavily carved glass slid noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly out of recesses within the wall to</seg><seg type="columnLine">close the gate through which Gerry had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just entered. The arch in which he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inside the thickness of the wall, faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">with white marble, inlaid with designs in</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold. Ahead, he could see a broad avenue</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ran from the gateway down through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the city. It was tree lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pleasant, thronged with people. Flow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers grew in little plots in front of the gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and white houses. Small furry animals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs, were evidently kept as pets. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsed on the doorsteps or scampered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the neat gardens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half a dozen men were standing around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry, within the arch of the gate. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were slight in stature though wiry, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads a little larger than normal and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptionally high foreheads. Their skin bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a tawny tinge, similar to that of the Ama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zons of Savissa. Two of them, who imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately took up posts just inside the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">portals of the gate, wore a semi-military</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform that included a gilded helmet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">others wore white cotton tunics and high</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather shoes. It suddenly struck Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this was the first place on Venus that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had visited where the majority of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens did not go heavily armed at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">times. Perhaps it was a good omen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the men stepped forward, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearded and gray-haired man who bore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold-tipped staff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Gool, chairman of the Council of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elders of Moorn," he said in the deep voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Gerry had heard outside. "The Coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cil has decided to see you at once. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the first outsider who has been per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted to enter the city of Moorn--White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Queen of the Outer Isles--in countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">generations. It would not have been per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted even now if you had been a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this planet. Come with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY went up a flight of steps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed into a metal car that hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an overhead rail supported by col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umns along the street. Gool touched a but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, and the car shot ahead at high speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the overhead mono-rail. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, who had settled comfortably back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the upholstered seats, was faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling as he watched Gerry's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are puzzled, stranger?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. There seemed to be nothing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plain but a lot of holes bored in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, and now ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now you find yourself in the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Moorn," Gool said. "A knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensional control is one of the reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">why we of this city have lived in peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and safety for so many centuries while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the planet is torn by constant wars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dimensional control?" Gerry said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. Gool nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. It is hard to put it into language</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will be clear to one who has no knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of our science. Perhaps I can ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain it by saying that the human eye is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-dimensional organism, and therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of perceiving only things that fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">into that same category. There are a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">many things in the universe, some of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest importance, that the ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's senses are incapable of. perceiving.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have learned how to cast a protective</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen of fourth-dimension rays about our</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, and the effect is that it becomes com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely invisible to the human eye. Do I</seg><seg type="columnLine">make myself clear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not entirely," Gerry grinned. "But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do know that your screen works!

They halted in a circular cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber where heavy springs caught and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">layed the last of the car's momentum, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pair of gold-helmeted guards saluted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gool as they helped him to alight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Council is ready and waiting, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord," said one.

The dozen mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of the council were all old men, gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beards who seemed dwarfed by the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed chairs in which they sat. They lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened with grave attention to Gerry's ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of what he had seen of conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Venus, but their austere faces showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sign of animation when he again sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested that they should intervene in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet's affairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are not interested," Gool said list-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the short-wave alarm in Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ry's helmet buzzed loudly.

That is the most that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HALF a dozen flying cars rested on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad platform on top of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the city of Moorn. Many bells</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tolling the noonday chimes as Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton led his armored men from the Vik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing aboard the compact little flying ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines. There was room for six men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">each car, the pilot and five passengers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only Angus and the necessary assistants</seg><seg type="columnLine">had remained behind to repair the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship with the materials supplied by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of Moorn.

The words</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed definitely ominous to Gerry, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he could say anything more the old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> man had bowed ceremonially and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back off the landing platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flying cars of Moorn were shallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowls of some gleaming blue metal, oval</seg><seg type="columnLine">in shape and with three comfortably up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holstered seats. They had no visible means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of propulsion. Curved windshields of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy glass protected the passengers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air-blast of swift motion, (jerry got</seg><seg type="columnLine">in beside the pilot of the leading car, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a slight and taciturn Moomian with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big head and high forehead of Ids race.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A complicated control board was fixed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">place before him. Closana and Portok</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the seat next behind, while two</seg><seg type="columnLine">more members of the Viking's crew occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied the rear seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ready?" the pilot asked. Gerry nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pilot touched a switch on the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol board before him, and three globular</seg><seg type="columnLine">dials glowed with an iridescent light. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-car rose easily from the landing plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, moving upward and outward at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep angle. There was neither noise nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration. The city vanished as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they passed outside the zone of dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional-control on its outer walls. Looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and down, Gerry saw only the pitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock of the foundations far below. A cart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was moving toward the beach with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars of metal for the Viking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the next flying car came into sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it sped out beyond the walls. Its nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into sight first, then the middle sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, finally the whole car. One after an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, the rest of the flotilla took off till</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were flying in a V-shaped formation</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a flock of wild geese.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What kind of power makes these cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">go?" Gerry asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Iso-electronic rays," the pilot replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly, not taking his eyes from the indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cator board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And can they be made invisible like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. The dimensional-control lever is</seg><seg type="columnLine">here." The pilot pointed at many of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls, then again lapsed into silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was evident that Gerry was not go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to be able to have any extended con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation with the driver of the car. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be due to instructions the man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">received from his superiors, or simply to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own nature. Probably a combination</seg><seg type="columnLine">of both! These men of Moorn were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and self-centered race. Probably they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were an isolated off-shoot of the original</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Ones who had first settled this planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a group who had managed to retain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific knowledge of their ancestors but</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lost the vigor and fire that are found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in active and vital nations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BELOW them lay the greenish yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanse of the Great Sea. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">these electronic flying cars of Moorn trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eled with a noiseless smoothness that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last word in flying comfort, their speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was much less than that of the Viking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">even minimum rocket power. The pilots</seg><seg type="columnLine">were holding the flotilla down to a level of</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few hundred feet. The sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vast expanse of rippling waters sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">past so close below them was a strange ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience to Gerry Norton, who had spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life in space-ships that always traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the upper levels where everything be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low looks like a gigantic patch-work quilt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scattered islands shouldered their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward through the sea ahead, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed past below. So utterly smooth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiseless was the movement of the elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronic flying cars that they seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing motionless, while a strong wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew against their glass shields and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the planet unrolled beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. It was well into the afternoon be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the familiar mountain ranges border-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Savissa came into view ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closana was leaning forward on her seat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes eager and youthful in the shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the steel helmet with which she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been fitted out from the Viking's stores.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as the coast line became clearer with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every passing mile, she suddenly pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead and down to two black dots on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the sea. The pilot took one</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at them, and then his hand moved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dimensional control lever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they first entered the flying cars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry had noticed that each one bore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very realistic appearing metal bird at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of a sort of flag-staff that protruded</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward at the bow. At the time he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it was simply a form of decora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Now he realized that the metal bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulfilled a much more useful purpose. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was outside the zone of invisibility, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave all the pilots something to indicate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">locations of the other cars and avoid col-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lisions. When he glanced back, all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see was a flock of birds following</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in a wide V. The flotilla was keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing formation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS they soared closer to shore, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">black dots gradually took shape as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of good-sized surface craft. A black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hulled raider, manned by a crew pf the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scaly Ones, was hotly engaged with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden Savissan patrol boat. Companies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Amazons crouched behind the high bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warks of their warship, loosing their ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows in stinging flights. Explosive bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets crackled around them as the Scaly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones replied with their gas-guns. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat was equipped with a big charging-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank, for reloading the gas-guns, equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment too heavy to be carried by land raid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers but possible here. The tide of battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was definitely setting against the Amazons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bodies of many of the golden-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">feminine warriors lay sprawled in the scup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers or scattered on the riven decks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closana's fists were clenched as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered down at the battle on the seas be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. The decks of the Savissan craft were</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to smolder, and her arrow fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">was weakening. Closana threw Gerry an</seg><seg type="columnLine">agonized glance, and he turned to the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him.	•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there any way we can strike at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">raider below?" he asked. The Moornian</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot smiled faintly, and then handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry a long metal rod that was equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gun-sights and had a sort of rubber</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock. A wire trailed away from it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was attached to the car's power plant be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the control boar. It looked like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd form of rifle, but the metal rod was</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid instead of hollow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aim--then press the button!" the taci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn Moornian said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry brought the strange-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon to his shoulder and sighted through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a line of rings set in the top. He cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the cross-hairs amidships on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-hulled Reptilian craft, then gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed the switch button set in the stock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a blinding flash of lightning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An instant later came the crashing roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder. Momentarily the flying car</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocked under the buffeting of the disturbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">air masses, then it steadied down again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the sea below, the battle had come to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">abrupt end. That single blow was enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lightning bolt struck the sea raider</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidships, with a blinding flash. The metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull glowed red hot. Water steamed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The jkfrk shapes of Scaly warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">went spinning off into the sea. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank of gas amidships exploded, sending a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet of blue flame high into the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Savissan war-craft rocked violently</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the waves created by the lightning bolt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the explosion. The surviving Ama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zons clung frantically to bullwarks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigging to avoid being washed overboard by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheet of foam-flecked water that spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">over die decks. Then as their craft stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ied down again, they looked up into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. All they could see was a flock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small birds speeding rapidly inland. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted their weapons to the sky in salute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tribute to whatever dark Gods had sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deadly bolt that wrecked the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry gingerly handed the deadly light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning caster back to the pilot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's an effective weapon," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If these flying cars can only stay with us</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few hours after we arrive at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of Larr, we can probably break up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attack of the Scaly Ones and ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We return to Moorn immediately, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as we have landed you in Larr," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot said with cold finality.

An</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour later the lights of Larr itself came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view. At first they were only a glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the horizon. Then, as the flotilla</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flying cars swept nearer, the lights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city began to take on definite form</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shape.

Other fires had been kindled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">besiegers. Dozens of cottages outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circuit of the city walls were also aflame,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing furiously. The whole place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffused with a ruddy and uneven light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the observers in the flying cars had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear view of the scene below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind the battlements and bastions atop</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city's walls crouched the Golden Ama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zons of the garrison, loosing their storms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of arrows at the swarming besiegers below</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Other tawny-skinned crews worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alta-ray tubes that belched blasts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue flame at regular intervals. Wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue beams struck, the ground was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackened while the twisted and charred</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes of Scaly Ones writhed in brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony.

The walls were crumbling into</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder in dozens of small spots as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching beams of the rays found a weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">point or flaw in ijhe stone, but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of the wholesale collapse that Lansa</seg><seg type="columnLine">had probably hoped to achieve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole scene below was like a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabre nightmare. The fires flashed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackled, and the explosive bullets of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scaly Ones twinkled like fire-flies through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drifting smoke. Red light glinted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the points of flying arrows. Savissan trum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pets blared defiance to the thunder of rep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilian drums. Most dramatic of all, silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">but terribly deadly, was the duel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray-casters as the red beams of the attack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers and the blue rays of the defenders</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted back and forth through the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the rapiers of fencing giants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE flotilla of flying cars darted down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the plaza in front of the Tower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Arrow. The pilots kept them invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they had landed, lest the nervous crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a defending ray-machine blast them be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore their identity was known. As soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the dimensional-control was switched</seg><seg type="columnLine">off there were cries of alarm, and a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasty arrows glanced harmlessly off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthmen's armor. Then Closana shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassuringly and they were recognized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little later Gerry and a few of his offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cers stood with Rupin-Sang on one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balconies of the Great Tower. The aged</seg><seg type="columnLine">king of Savissa wore full armor though</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shadows of his gilded helmet his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face looked old and gray and tired. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side them, a squad of the Golden Amazons</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked a long-range ray-tube that was fir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the rear areas of the Reptilian posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. The muscles of the feminine war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors rippled beneath their tawny skins as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they swung the heavy controls of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray-machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They came against one of our barrier</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forts from the rear, in great, numbers,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rupin-Sang said wearily. "I cannot im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agine how they had managed to get so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many men in behind our lines. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably brought them under water in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that submarine they used when they took</seg><seg type="columnLine">me captive," Gerry said. "Brought them</seg><seg type="columnLine">through in relays. I should have sent you</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning to block the river channel against</seg><seg type="columnLine">that craft, but I never thought Lansa would</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike so quickly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At least we had enough warning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepare for the defense of the city after</seg><seg type="columnLine">they broke through the frontier," Rupin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sang said. "We called in all the surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing troops. We sent the very young and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very old, the ill and the crippled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to comparative safety in the hills by way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of secret trails through the swamps. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls will stand against the new rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Scaly Ones are using, we should be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold out for a long time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The armor of my men is proof against</seg><seg type="columnLine">either rays or explosive bullets," Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him, "and our ray-guns are superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">to those that Lansa has been able to make.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll use my men as shock troops to beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">back any particularly pressing attack. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween us, we can hang on until Lansa gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired of the siege."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope you're right," Rupin-Sang said</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomily, "but I recall the old prophecy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is in my mind that the end of the Golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">City of Larr is at hand, and that the sands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my nation run very low. However--</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will fight to the end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No bunch of half-lizards led by a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">renegade is going to lick me!" Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A WEEK later Gerry Norton was less</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident. Haggard and unshaven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stalked into an inner room and tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his helmet clattering on the table. His ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mor was badly dented by the impact of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many explosive bullets, and one forearm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was burned where a supode ray had mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily pierced between the chinks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Steve," Gerry said wearily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it's your watch. Go up on the walls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anything new ?" Steve Brent asked, sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting up on the cot where he had been sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and running both hands through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENUS	47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tousled crop of sandy hair. His freckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was as .lined and drawn as Gerry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another of the bastions on the west</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall came down under the rays, but we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding the breach all right with archers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a portable ray-caster. Hurry and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there, like a good fellow! I left Por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tok in charge, and he's dead on his feet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not so damn much alive myself!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steve muttered, but he put on his helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went clanking off up the corridor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry sat down heavily on a bench, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment too tired even to take off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor. The city of Larr still held out--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that was all that could be said. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scaly Ones still pressed the assault day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and night without ceasing. The once</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty walls of yellow stone were crum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling under the constant attack of the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the defense of the steadily widening</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaches put an added strain on the dwin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dling numbers of the garrison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If oniy the Viking would come! Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">duralite hull would withstand either rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">or explosives, and her own powerful ray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes should be able to blast the attacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">artillery out of existence ad thereby raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">the siege. But he could not raise the space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship on the radio! That was the thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried Gerry most of all. Tanda had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been trying at hourly intervals for days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he could not get any answer from</seg><seg type="columnLine">McTavish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last Gerry stretched out on the cot</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Steve had quitted, and almost instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to sleep. It seemed only a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later that he awoke to find Portok the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian shaking him by the shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry laboriously raised himself up on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow shaking his head to clear his brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So strong were the bonds of sleep that sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral seconds passed before his brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the meaning of the words that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portok was shouting in his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Chief! Can't you hear me ? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole western wall has come down, carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all the ray-tubes with it. The Scaly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones are in the city!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GERRY seized his helmet and weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the table where he had thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and dashed out of the room. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the balconies of the Arrow Tower</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could see the swift disaster that had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">come upon the City of Larr. The cease-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, unrelenting play of Lansa's supode</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray machines had finally weakened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city's western wall until the whole rampart</seg><seg type="columnLine">had collapsed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The once towering wall was now only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long mound of rubble. The companies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scaly Ones nearest the wall had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried in the debris when it fell, but fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">hordes were pouring forward with a shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelping. The Amazon archers defending</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall from above had been mainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed in the wreckage. Reserve regi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were hurrying into place at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">double, bow strings twanging and long</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden hair streaming out behind them but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was one loss that could not be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed. All the alta-ray machines on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall were shattered and broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The despairing courage of Larr's femi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine defenders was not enough to hold that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile-long pile of rubbish whose sloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides could be easily climbed by the swarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hordes from Giri-Vaaka. The Ama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zons were falling back all along the line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The retreat was a slow and stubborn one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was steady. Such of the alta-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines as could be brought to bear upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shattered wall from other portions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fortifications swept the advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scaly Ones with blue blasts that tore gap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing holes in their ranks, but there were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of them. The firelight gleamed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the armor of a few of the Viking's men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were fighting with the rear-guard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ray-guns stabbing viciously into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reptilian ranks as they fell back. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums of the Scaly Ones took on a deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthed bellow of triumph, and the brazen</seg><seg type="columnLine">trumpets of Larr were the voice of a for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lorn and fading hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rupin-Sang appeared on the balcony be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Gerry, leaning his gnarled old hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rail. He was smiling, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">final disaster had at least brought a relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">from strain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the end of the City of Larr,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "The ancient prophecy of Jeddah-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Khana comes true after all. Save yourself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and your men while you can, my friend."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't we all escape through the swamps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put up a better fight in the hills?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry asked. Rupin-Sang shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, my friend. The last survivors will</seg><seg type="columnLine">do that when all is over, but we will de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fend Larr to the end--street by street and</seg><seg type="columnLine">house by house--as the tradition of Sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vissa. We are the last descendants of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Ones. We may die, but we will do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with honor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The swift advance of Lansa's men bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply into the city, halfway from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered wall to the central plaza sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding the Great Tower, before it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked at a line of hasty barricades.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was bitter house-to-house fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">all across the city. Gerry knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand at the barricades could not be sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained for very long. The advance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scaly Ones had at the moment outdis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanced their supode ray casters and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy caliber gas-guns. For the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Amazon arrows held them checked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The advance was sure to resume as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Lansa's heavy weapons could be brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">up again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was a hopeless fight--and yet Gerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not bring himself to leave. Partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was his affection for the grief-stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">but indomitable Closana that held him</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Partly it was the sheer courage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Amazon's gallant fight against such</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy odds that kept him in the battle line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By some standards the affair was none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his business but he could not quit now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However--he had not the right to hold his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the stricken city if they wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave. As he located the various members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Viking's crew in the disorganized</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amazon ranks, he gave each one permis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion to escape from the city through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastern marshes. Portok's reaction was</seg><seg type="columnLine">typical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Run from these snake-skinned dev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ils?" the little Martian panted hoarsely, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruddy face gaunt and his eyes sunken deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their sockets. "Not while I can still</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand. I'm staying with the rear guard--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as there is one!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> New fires had been started by the vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory-drunk Reptilians, fires within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. The lurid glow of burning houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">made, the night hideous. Fully a third of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city was in flames by now, and only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the easterly wind kept the flames from</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving the defenders away from those</seg><seg type="columnLine">portions of the city that they still held.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By noon the next day the tale was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">all told. The Savissans now held less than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a third of their city, a V-shaped sector</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Arrow Tower at its apex. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">murky beams of supode rays were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually playing against the walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Tower itself, and small cascades of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulverized rock kept sliding off the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stone work as the weaker parts be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to decompose under the steady impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rays. And still the fight went on!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry liad forgotten what it w'as like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lie down and rest. He was leaning in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an angle of the wall, actually asleep on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, when Chester Sand from the Viking</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried across to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rupin-Sang wants to see you down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garden right away, Chief!" Sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted. "You and Steve Brent both."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right. Get Steve," Gerry growled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sighed, and tightened his belt, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearily down the steps to the lower floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE pleasant walled garden behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower was a very different place from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stop Gerry had seen when he first came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Savissa. The explosive bullets of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scaly Ones had ripped up many of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, and shattered the marble statues. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap of debris fallen from above lay along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the tower wall, while more was</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly trickling down as the murky</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams of the supode rays criss-crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead. The bodies of dead Amazons</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scattered here and there on the tram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled grass. Dense clouds of acrid smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the burning city swirled down over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garden wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Closana was waiting in the garden, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor dim and battered. Her left arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heavily bandaged, but she still carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">a naked sword in her right hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was told that you wanted me," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. Gerry shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it was your father who sent for</seg><seg type="columnLine">vie." Just then Steve and Chester Sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">came across the garden. A faint suspicion</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to stir in Gerry's mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is Rupin-Sang?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sand hesitated, and cleared his throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were shifty. Then Gerry heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slight sound behind him. He spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">around--and looked squarely into the muz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zle of a ray-tube held by Lansa himself!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had been neatly trapped! Lansa</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a dozen of his men had come up</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOLDEN AMAZONS OF VENVS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">through the sewers and slain the Amazon</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards' posted there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "DropTyour weapons!" Lansa snapped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerry shrugged and obeyed, and the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed his example. There was a tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphant smile on the renegade's saturnine</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. "I am glad you were not killed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fighting, Norton," he said, "because</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and Brent and the girl will make very</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable hostages for me when your space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship eventually returns."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gerry turned and stared at Chester</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sand. The Viking's Safety Officer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale, but he met the other man's glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sort of weak defiance. Gerry's lip</seg><seg type="columnLine">curled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you are the rat who slugged me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I caught Olga in the radio room!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I should have known it. I seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have left several loose ends I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have watched, but I'll fix you for this some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day and ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You won't be fixing anybody any more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton," Lansa said grimly. "After I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">used you to get possession of the Viking</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll die in the torture chambers at Vaaka-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausen. Thanks to my good friend Sands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I also know the location of the invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. That, too, I will attend to.

Bind and gag the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He never finished the sentence. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sharp hiss, and a thud. A narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel point stood a hand's breadth out be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond his throat. A wondering expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into his eyes. Then his knees buckled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he went down on the trampled grass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Across the garden, still holding the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun from which he had shot the long steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">slug, stood Sarnak of Luralla!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Scaly Ones went for their weap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ons, but a vengeful throng of the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">law brood of the Dragon came pouring up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from below on the heels of their leaders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no thought of quarter between</seg><seg type="columnLine">these hereditary foes. There was a short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp fight--and then the last of Lansa's</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiding part}' died in the shadow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Sarnak came striding forward, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand outstretched and a cheerful smile on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his broad face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems that I came in very good time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friends!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A--Planet Stories--Winter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perfect," Gerry grinjjed. "But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">does your coming mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It means that the hour of deliverance</seg><seg type="columnLine">is at hand. When Lansa brought his full</seg><seg type="columnLine">force eastward against Savissa, it gave us</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opportunity we have been needing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">generations. We of the Dragon's Teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose against the scanty garrisons he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, and put them to the sword. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of the people joined us then, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chances of victory looked so strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hope overcame the despair born of</seg><seg type="columnLine">generations of oppression. Now the Green</seg><seg type="columnLine">Folk of Giri have thrown off the yoke of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invader at last, and thousands of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">are marching this way to take the army of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Scaly Ones in the rear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how did you come to arrive in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden at this particular moment?"

We saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crude type of under-water craft moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this direction, and followed it at a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance. You know the rest. After bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down the sentries that Lansa had posted</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, we left our dolphins and our water</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmets down at the main drain and crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">up through the passages to this place."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When do you think the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Green Folk will come?"

The worst is over now!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shouted.

Out of the ruined and flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">city fled the Reptilian men, while troops</seg><seg type="columnLine">of swift-footed Amazons hung on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">flanks and rear with twanging bows. Back</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the plains toward the border they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled--and ran squarely into the grim thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of the Green People who tore them</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart with the savagery of an oppressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">race just finding their souls again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">few that survived, out of the powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">army that Lansa the mad Earth-man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought eastward to attack Savissa, were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">handful who fled back across the land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Giri and vanished into the desolate Vaaka</seg><seg type="columnLine">marshes from which their people had first</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged generations before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Golden City was hopelessly afire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">past saving, and the survivors gathered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a level field outside the northern wall.

"Lansing never walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from here, unless as a ghost. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him go down.

Gerry was watching the flames</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweep over the last of the city. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time the Arrow Tower remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing above the sea of fire, but then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it began to tip. Faster and faster it fell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">till it came down in a shower of sparks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Closana dropped her head in her hands, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Rupin-Sang touched his daughter on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Save your grief," girl," he said.

That, after the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster, the people of Savissa would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a re-birth.

"Fluorine doesn't attack mica--</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least at earth temperatures.

The pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty men at the lock swung the handles</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a bored manner, and just as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering Adam thought he caught another</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of Paulette around the comer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corridor, and raised one sheathed arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wave her farewell, but she did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Jake?" called Adam through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chest phone. There was a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clicks. "All right, Mr. Adam."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Adam swung the lode control and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grip of the pale ocean, colder than</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything on earth, sliding up around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, to his waist. Another spin of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle, and side by side the two were set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling gently through the opalescent depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the surface of Pluto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INSIDE the ship, the lock attendants</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone off duty and the corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for the moment empty. Paulette</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at the pressure gauge, saw that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">registered a blank, which meant that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two had left the lock, and then turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly to look along the corridor. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At least," Walter had said to her, "wait</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">till those two come back. You don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what may be in that ocean out there--an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean of liquid air and fluorine. Dr. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kins says we don't know a thing about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">climates of these extreme cold planets, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what forms of life may exist. Think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those horrible quick-acting fungi that</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed the explorers of the first Uranus</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you practically ordered Mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Longworth to go," she had retorted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's different. Danger is his busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no point in arguing. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">left it at that, and promising Walter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejoin him later, strolled down the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor and up the ramp to the outer air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock. But danger was her business, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she told herself, as she swung back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door to the compartment in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space suits were kept, and hastily took</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the smallest on the rack. Yes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye-pieces were mica-covered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danger was her business, she told her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self again, as she turned on the pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">jets to clear the lock; she was Paulette</seg><seg type="columnLine">deVries, the radio gal, chosen for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in this expedition out of all the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorders of three planets for her utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearlessness. And besides, that snip of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">First Mate, Adam Longworth, had inti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mated that she needed protection. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock snapped to behind her, and as it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, she thought exultantly that Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walter McCausland might as well learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">now as any other time that he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">order his prospective wife around, even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could make everyone else aboard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddard jump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE water was very dark, the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bottle glass, splotched here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there with darker, purplish shadows. Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">above her, Paulette could see the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">shimmering line of light that marked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space ship. It looked to be hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above her. Five steps in any direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, she knew, would blot it out com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely. She had no great fear of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost, as the compass guide at her belt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuned to the ship's control compass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would always point to it. Somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">down here in the dark around her Adam</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Jake were also exploring the bottom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although she couldn't see them, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">62	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thought gave her courage. She stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentatively forward. One--two-three--</seg><seg type="columnLine">four--five--at each step floating a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">before she came down. She could no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer see the faint, comfortable lights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship som'ewhere above her, and for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief moment, panic tore at her throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She fought it down. Silly! She peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">around her, as though the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake and Adam wtrnld make them mate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rialize. There! There they were. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see them dimly, like shadows, to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. She turned and walked as swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she could in the direction. How Adam</seg><seg type="columnLine">would laugh at her for her fears. What a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little coward--. She stopped suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cold, clammy fingers of fear rippled</seg><seg type="columnLine">along her spine. The dark shadow before</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wasn't Adam or Jake! It was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing tall and thin. Something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed alive, weaving back and forth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the same color as the water. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed about ten feet high and six inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, and was made up of sections like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a string of sausages. Then over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right she saw more of them--a regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like the snapping of a brittle icicle, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tension broke. They were plants. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of natural flora, swaying to and fro</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the icy currents of that dark sea. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed hysterically, and relief flooded her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathing her in perspiration. But the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience had nevertheless unnerved her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coward or not, she decided she had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, and turned to find her way back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ship. Then she saw it! Behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little above her. Something big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiter than the color of the water, hover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, drifting. She tried to hurry. Tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell herself it was just another surpris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but inanimate form of life to be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this strange planet, but as she glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and up, she saw the thing was keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing perfect pace with her. Horrified, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched as it settled slowly toward her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huge. White. Hideously opaque. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't move. She could only stand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooted as in some frightful nightmare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring with bursting eyes as the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted gently toward her. Then panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">took her. She opened her mouth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream, but no sound came from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangling throat, and her tongue clove</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly to the roof of her mouth. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">put her arms up, like a child trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">push aside a horrible dream. Her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched a soft, white pulpy body. Touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, then to her utter horror passed thi-bitgh</seg><seg type="columnLine">intv the body itself! They were gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that opaque substance. And still the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing settled lower, like a great hideous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white cloak. It would cover her com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely. Absorb her. As it had absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands. As it was even now absorb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her wrists--her arms . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ADAM and Jake Burchall had set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the idea of tracing a circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some 300 yards around the ship. In spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the weak gravity, the pressure was</seg><seg type="columnLine">against them, and at each long, floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">step they paused while Adam probed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silt of the ocean floor with a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod. Rock surface was only inches down;</seg><seg type="columnLine">what kind of rock he could not tell. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">each step they encountered the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">sausage-like chain-weeds Paulette had met,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twice Adam attempted to pull up one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the singular Plutonian plants, only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find it breaking into sections at a touch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suspect," said Adam through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone, "that these are some very low form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life. Look how they break along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">joint, Jake. They probably reproduce in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fashion, breaking off to form an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely new plant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny we haven't seen any other form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. It would be more usual to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of hundred on an ocean floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A surge in the water round them nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept the explorers from their feet. Adam</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up. Scarcely ten feet above him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge brownish globe shot past, twice his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own height, its smooth surface studded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with countless tiny arms that beat the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water in unison. As he gazed at it, a paler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitish mass soared through the twilight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leap on the brown globe, and twisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in each other's grip, they passed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jake's gasp came through the earphones</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then his giggle, "Pie--he--he, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam, there's two more forms of life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we make another one, if we stay alive till</seg><seg type="columnLine">we get back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another three steps, and they halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">again at the sight of a shapeless, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">EXPEDITION TO PLtTO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">white mass looming through the fog of</seg><seg type="columnLine">green ahead. It was alive; it moved, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowing, rather than swimming, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly as they could make out in the dim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was without eyes, mouth or visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">organs of any kind, a huge, shapeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">jelly. Adam reached for the rocket pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his belt, but Jake's eye had caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion and his voice came through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earphones, "Don't use that thing, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam. It ain't--Holy catfish!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The huge colorless jelly had sidled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them through the water, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheered off, revealing as it did so, a core</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some darker color through its trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucent sides and three shapeless legs whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion propelled it. As it made the turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the explorers it bumped one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the curious segmented weeds and Jake</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cried out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR where the animal had bumped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weed a huge dent appeared in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded forward end, growing rapidly till</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a cavern, a cavern which engulfed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chainweed. Instantly the lips of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern closed; Adam could see that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface had become as smooth as before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while inside the translucent structure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the animal the outline of the weed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've seen things like that before," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam softly, as though fearful of attract-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the monster's attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where ? I ain't never seen nothing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. And I'm telling you, Mr. Adam, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">been around a lot. Even in those dinosaur</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamps on Venus."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ever look through a microscope, Jake?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can't say as I have very often, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's just what you see in a micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope, Jake.

Those big white lumps, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">can turn themselves into mouths anywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">they want to and then close up and turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves into stomachs, they're amoebas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amoebas as big as whales! They're the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most savage animals in the whole created</seg><seg type="columnLine">kingdom--and just about the most danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous for their size"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer's voice was doubtful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mean we're sort of in a microscope?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam grunted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Microscope my left foot! Those things</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">are real! They're dangerous!

Let's get out of here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took off in a long soaring step that</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried him jerkily six feet through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, Jake following. They had pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressed perhaps three leaps, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer's voice was suddenly loud inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam's helmet--"Look! On the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Adam checked himself in mid-leap and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a dark figure in the green gloom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the undersea world, with one of the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">amoebas swooping toward it. "A man!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">came Jake's voice. "It's attacking one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew. Stand still you, we're coming!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was no answer; the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">diver only put up his arms to ward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing off, and they saw1 his hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty, weaponless. Another leaping step</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried them almost within reach of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous thing that at the first touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other diver's hands had suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed itself into the huge ingestion fun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel. Adam swung his arm back to stab</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amoeba with his explosive spear, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake's voice came through the earphones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too close, Mr. Adam. He's right on</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of that man; you'll blow him to pieces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let me try to attract him away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jake was holding out the harmless end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the spear. He prodded the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">amoeba briskly, and he did so, the jelly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like creature again opened a huge funnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swooped with a speed surprising for</seg><seg type="columnLine">so large and formless an object. Jake</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged and flattened to the sea-bottom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting "Give it to him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Adam jabbed, pressing the button of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spear as he did so. There was a vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent shock; Adam himself went down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impact of the compressed water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he fell saw the diver they had rescued</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbling also. Above them a cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">milky silt boiled up, then whipped away in</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ribbons as some obscure current of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that strange sea caught it. The giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">amoeba loomed through the murk, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ragged hole in its side--but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole was closing, healing before their very</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes!</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he tried ta rise and draw the rocket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol again, Adam's ears caught Jake's</seg><seg type="columnLine">growl of fury, and he saw the engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunge with another of the bomb-spears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again there was the violent shock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">murky cloud, half clearing to show Adam</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange diver, who took two staggering</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps toward him and then collapsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his supporting arm. At their feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant amoeba lay, a whitish, shapeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, injured beyond the power of a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond restoration--but no! As he watched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot long bud'suddenly projected from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of the mass, swelled, detatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, and then slithered off into the dim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Holy catfish!" ejaculated Jake.

A weight gripped him</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the chest; he rolled over, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands caught only loose stones, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slide came to a stop as abrupt as its</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning, he found himself lying on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, the weight across his legs, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, far up toward where a speck of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ship seemed miles away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached out one hand and touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">something as smooth as though it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished and gently warm. "Mr. Adam!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said a voice suddenly, and he recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as Jake's. 'Are you all right, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think so, but my legs are caught."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll get you free in a minute. Anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">else?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I got hit in the belly," came a voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where's Flack?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer was lifting something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can you get out there now, Mr. Adam?</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll be all right in a minute." Adam</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a heave, felt his entangled legs slide</seg><seg type="columnLine">free and pulled himself onto a pile of debris</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as a light glared on like a star from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the other men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are we all here? Where's Flack?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a counting of noses and a gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral feeling of bodies for bruises. Above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, where the wall of the cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, they could make out that the sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den break through had carried them down</seg><seg type="columnLine">some twenty feet. "Here he is. Just an</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm sticking out. I'm afraid he's done</seg><seg type="columnLine">for. Come here, everyone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the digging machines was brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">into play and they labored to get the pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oned man free, but as they cleared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken stone and rubble from around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, it became evident that the effort was</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless. The eyes were glazed, the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung limp. Adam stepped back against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the cave-in around them, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did so his hand touched it. Once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">he noticed it was both smooth and warm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned, and in the light of the atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps now blazing across the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave-in examined it. It was not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth and warm, but polished; and just</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his head he could see where the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and metal began--a clean-fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">job, a manufactured wall!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jake!" he called excitedly, "bring that</seg><seg type="columnLine">digging machine over here for a second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The one with the cutting head."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little engineer turned, and bounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in a couple of steps, digging machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand. "Why, that's a metal wall," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried, and applied the head for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a brief surge of power. The bit cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">out an inch-deep circle of metal, dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on some of the rubble with a tinny</seg><seg type="columnLine">clang. Jake bent to pick it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's light enough to be beryllium," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, handing the disc to Adam, and turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back to the wall, drove his cutter into</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with renewed energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you doing?" demanded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate, hefting the disc of metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This wall sounds hollow. Here goes!''</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had driven the machine deep in, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping back, pulled the handle marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Split." There was a sudden rending</seg><seg type="columnLine">clang; a crash and a six-foot section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall fell inwards. The two men stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hole it had left, heedless of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that the other members of the exca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">EXPEDITION TO PLUTO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vating crew were crowding up behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were looking into a low square</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, perhaps twenty feet across. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far side was a doorway, and in the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way stood a man!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To be sure he was such a man as none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them had ever before seen. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not over four and a half feet tall, yet with</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms as long as an earthling's hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">down below his knees, tremendously broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, and a head that seemed per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manently pushed forward and downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">above them. Below that head the creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wrapped from neck to toe in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">shimmering blue material with a metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">luster, banded around the arms and legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">with red metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they gazed in astonishment, the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">took two steps forward, his head bobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his neck at each step, opened his lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and uttered "Wahwahroo!" in a voice thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gutturals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ADAM glanced around at his own men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then once more at the Plutonian</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarf, whose face, as far as he could judge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore an expression of intense interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than of fear or anger. The remark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he judged, would be a greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wahwahroo!" he replied amiably, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Plutonian continued to stare in a man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner that indicated Adam's first lesson in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this unknown tongue was far from a suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand by," he remarked to the crew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm going in and try to talk to this bird.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ma}' be trouble." Catching the sides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the split in the wall, he jumped down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small cascade of pebbles that rang on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor below in a manner which assured him</seg><seg type="columnLine">this also was metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't understand what you're saying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man," he remarked to the Plutonian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had remained standing in the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and touching a finger to lips and ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">to emphasize the point. "I don't under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, but maybe you'll be able to get it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a picture."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From one of his pockets he produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of paper, and with one of the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">print-pencils that had just been developed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketched rapidly at a crude drawing of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket-ship with little men issuing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath it into the waves of an ocean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Plutonian accepted it from his hand,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at it with a puzzled expression, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned it, nodding violently, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expression on his face that bespoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete lack of comprehension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Adam!" It was Jake's voice from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. "I'm sending the others back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Flack to get some weapons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right.

Adam smiled approval; the Plu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonian reached out, took the drawing again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and studied it gravely for a moment, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed at one of the little figures, at Adam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Adam did his best to signify that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plutonian had grasped the point. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarf held up one hand, palm out toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam, then turned to the door behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam watched without moving, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown spread across the Plutonian's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I got it, Mr. Adam," called Jake from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rent in the wall, "all the signals are</seg><seg type="columnLine">different here. He holds up his hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop you because he wants you to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It might be. Adam took an experimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">step toward the Plutonian, and saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter's face clear. They reached the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, and Adam noticed it did not open</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hinges, but slid. The Plutonian touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">some kind of lever or contact in the frame,</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered something in his deep voice, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood waiting. Beyond the door, Adam</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed, was another room, perfectly dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as the Plutonian stopped speaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a rustle of feet within and a file</seg><seg type="columnLine">of half a dozen dwarfs emerged, each an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exact duplicate of the first as nearly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam could judge. They formed a circle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at Adam and at the torn wall with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jake gazing through Each in turn stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, examined Adam from head to</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot and having emitted a few expressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunts took his place in the circle again. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed friendly, but after the last one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">70	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">looked over Adam, one of the Plutonians</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced some kind of weapon with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer-like head and a handle set cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise, and waved the earth-man back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tear in the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Adam looked around at Jake, saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had one of the digging machines in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and decided that retreat toward this</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection was the best policy. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the Plutonians intention to dismiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, evidently. One of them, whose metal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic armbands were more numerous than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest, stepped forward, reached for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam's print-pencil, and when Adam</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to it his piece of paper, was busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the paper, when he handed it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth-man, were seven groups of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dots, one in the first, two in the second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three in the third, regularly up to seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">dots in the seventh group.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dwarf pointed to himself, then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the single dot; and followed by indicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of the other six Plutonians, in turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one of the lines of dots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When this effort at communication had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been executed, he pointed to the single dot</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, then to Adam, and finally to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does he want ?" asked Jake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's he trying to get at ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I know," replied Adam. "See</seg><seg type="columnLine">these numbers of dots? He's trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me he's the number one man here, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wants to talk to our number one man."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned to the Plutonian, saluting, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed to see the dwarf returning him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">carbon copy of the movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll stay here," he said to Jake.

Perhaps she could discover why</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seemed to be intent on wrecking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own expedition. She glanced about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">noting every possible location for hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. There was the chart rack, full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled maps. Not likely. Then the book-</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, rows of neat bound volumes. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained the desk and the safe. Methodi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally she examined drawer after drawer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling sure that nothing very important</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been left so loosely about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing--but what was this? A</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip of paper on which were written four</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers and the words, "Changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">4/14/2432."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She pocketed it quickly'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastily she went to the safe and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the simple number locks--to find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle swing instantly open! Its contents</seg><seg type="columnLine">were two bundles of papers. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">consisted of ancient stock certificates. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye glanced at the name on one, one thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand shares of Niagara Hydro to Walter</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCausland. Worthless old things . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">but kept in the safe! Then the light broke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She pieced together a dozen slight refer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences from remembered conversations--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walter's warm liking for the ancient days</seg><seg type="columnLine">of electricity and steam, his hatred of mod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">em things. He had plotted to turn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world back four centuries; to destroy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole system that had been built on atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. And, she realized as she explored</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thick pile of stocks that he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the richest man in that restored world. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a wild dream, an insane one, yet she</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddered as she thought how nearly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had succeeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Idly she glanced at the other slab of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper--the drawn conversations with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plutonians. Nothing else. But why were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they also kept in the safe? She glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly through them, frowned at one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then gasped in sheer horror as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood it. It was an incredible draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of dwarf men who thrust taller humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a tank of water, while other dwarfs</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed in a strange ritual. But the horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for the vague thing drawn inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank--it was impossible, yet what mistake</seg><seg type="columnLine">could there be? . . . She must hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . hurry . . . yet she banged the safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut and locked it, before leaving and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing down the corridor with the bundle</seg><seg type="columnLine">76	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of drawings hugged to her gasping breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">McCAUSLAND'S face was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">w'ith some nameless thought, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes narrowed shrewdly enough when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the girl had left.

The Plutonians</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, on the last day, not only permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">but actually suggested that the crew visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sacred temple. He looked hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the ante-room, trying to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in order. The half dozen scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">were everywhere, poking about into things</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cries of excitement. Two strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed guards began throwing open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple door and everyone surged forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inside, they gazed open-mouthed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge room was three times as high as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual low Plutonian ceiling, on which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthmen frequently bumped their heads.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At one end was a large gallery, ten feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the floor, and here, tier on tier, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of the dwarfs. They rose at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment and began reciting a sonorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">chant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the center of the room, twenty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">square, milky blue, lit from unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths below, was a glass tank. Adam saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a gasp of horror and dread, the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that floated in it--it was a huge Amoeba.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked shrewdly about and noted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverent attitude of the gallery. Could this</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror be the Plutonians' deity ? The Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">God Amoeba? Nervous now, he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind and shouted. The temple doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were closing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wayland! Jake!" he cried, leaping to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doors. A dozen men turned and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the run, but they pushed and battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in vain on the smooth metal as the doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">clanged shut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're prisoners!" snapped Adam.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Anyone bring a weapon . . . anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all? Even a spanner, Bjornsen? A</seg><seg type="columnLine">bomb-spear, Rossiter? Don't use it, fool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll kill us all! Well, we're in a hell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fix! Our bare fists! Let's get at those</seg><seg type="columnLine">dam' dwrarfs on the balcony, anyway. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow boost his neighbor up. Ready ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They rushed in a mob, and though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten-foot wall meant incredible height to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dwarf Plutonians, their front ranks</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew back nervously, and the rearmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">made for the exits. When they saw these</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthmen climb on each other's shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">EXPEDITION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and actually drawing themselves over into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gallery they broke in a panic and milled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the exits. Great Bjornsen was amopg</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first and while the others turned to aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">their companions, he charged roaring. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen of the dwarfs, dangerous as</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapped rats, threw themselves on him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three went down with pile-driver blows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">skulls cracked like egg-shells, but the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pulled down by sheer numbers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been killed on the spot had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cry from the rear of the balcony saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The Plutonians were through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors, which were held open until the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineer's assailants rushed through, where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon they closed shut. The earthmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged and raged against them five min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes before Adam called them back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Save your strength, men.

Then, on the ceiling low over their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads at the back of the gallery the familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">whining snarl of one of their own atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">drills broke out. Adam crouched, muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for whatever might offer. The drill</seg><seg type="columnLine">droned on and the point showed through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a pause and with a clang a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of the ceiling was wrenched up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell over on the floor above. And the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing framed the face of Paulette deVries!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come up!" she cried softly. "Oh hurry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry!" and into Adam's ear she poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">her story, as soon as he had crawled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bjornsen's shoulders to her side. Adam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice immediately broke into action, urging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men to greater speed. He lay on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach reaching down to aid the climbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">from below. Bjornsen was the last man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as the strain of his weight fell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam's muscles he saw the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple open and a vast mob of Plutonian</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards rush in. Bjornsen was up now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paulette tugging at Adam to come, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Adam had seen something--could it</seg><seg type="columnLine">be! Yes, no mistake. There were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans, still struggling, being carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the temple floor to the great tank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dozen dwarfs bore the leading man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its brink and with a great heave and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout from the mob, he fell into the milky</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO PLUTO	77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">water. "It's the captain," groaned Adam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-lowering himself as though to attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rescue. But Bjornsen's great arm gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his leg. "The dirty rat," growled that</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant, "he's gettin' what he planned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Anyway, it's hopeless, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as he dragged Adam away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hole in the ceiling, he caught one last</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of Walter McCausland, frantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring eyes pressed to the glass under</seg><seg type="columnLine">wat§r, as the great white Amoeba closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">its flesh around him and the man's form</seg><seg type="columnLine">became cloudy and, after a moment, ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh Adam, hurry!" moaned Paulette.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were in a low space, which ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended in all directions, supported by squat</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillars. "It's a sort of bulk-head space</seg><seg type="columnLine">above their hollow world--separates them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the water above," explained the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I broke into it from the dig-tunnel and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we hurry. ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Longworth, sir," a member of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew broke in excitedly. "I've still got</seg><seg type="columnLine">this bomb-spear. I can set it and time it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go off. Why not leave it here behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and blow this damn bulk-head to pieces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wipe out that lousy nest of murderers."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gripped the missile in his hands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent over to place it against the bulk-head</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Adam turned to him flashingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"None of that, Rossiter. These people are</seg><seg type="columnLine">only protecting themselves.

I said to pick up that bomb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and come along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rossiter looked at Adam with red, fury-</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled eyes. "To hell with what you said,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he screamed. "These lousy freaks killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain McCausland.

Yes, and us, too. Let me go!</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll kill me, you fool! Let me go!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah--a-a-a-ah!" He collapsed inertly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor of the tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Adam sucked his bruised knuckles, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes like bits of flint. His gaze stabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the silent circle of men around him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Anyone else feel the same way ?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "No? All right, we'll go on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Petersen, pick him up and carry him along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'll be all right. He cracked, poor devil."</seg><seg type="columnLine">78	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They raced along the bulk-head, crouch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the confined space. After what</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed ages, Paulette gasped. "Just ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us ... see it .. . there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jagged hole in the wall appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them, but even as they tore madly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it, it filled with a horde of seamed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinkled faces, and squat, ugly bodies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam knew there could be no hesitating.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If they stopped now, they were lost. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop," he shouted. "Keep going. Right</seg><seg type="columnLine">through 'em !" With a thudding shock the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthmen met the dwarfs. Bare fists rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell, flailing like sledge-hammers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown horde fell back before the on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaught. Countless numbers were down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">skulls crushed like egg shells. Then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly the crunch of Bjornsen's fists cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gap, and the desperate crew plunged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Ahead of them was the dig-tunnel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its ladder leading upward to the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious safety of the space-ship. The way</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear, for the astounded Plutonians</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not had time to rally their scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But Adam knew it would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before they did. Across the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vening space the little party dashed, straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the opening of the dig-tunnel. Fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Just fifty feet above them was safety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But climbing the ladder with an uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious man among them was torturingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow work. Adam was the last to go up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he passed the quarter mark, he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enraged shouts of the dwarfs behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He risked one quick look over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. They were already pouring into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel, and the first ranks had started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swarm the ladder. "Hurry," he gasped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're coming up!" Like a snail he</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed. Rung by slow rung. Time stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. There was no sound except the pant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the earthmen above, and the ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearing swish of small slippered feet below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Adam saw that the first of his crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached the ship, and were clambering</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the port. He saw Paulette enter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hands reached down to help Petersen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his unconscious burden. They could</seg><seg type="columnLine">go up faster now. Another moment or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two and they would be safe. Adam gasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in relief as he saw the open port close</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him. Three more rungs. Two!</seg><seg type="columnLine">One!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something gripped his foot. Something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that pulled, and clung like a vise in spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his frantic kicking. He looked down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twp of the Plutonians had grabbed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bracing themselves were pulling fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically. Helplessly he watched while</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, powerful arms went out, closed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his other foot. He felt it pulled from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rung, and now he hung there, held only</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his arms that grasped the rung above</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Arms that creaked in their sockets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until darting streaks of pain shot across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes. Hands that were wet with sweat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping . . . slipping. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick sir. Here!" Adam's staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes saw the huge figure of Bjornsen lean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the port above him. But so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him. The man could never reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Then he felt strong huge hands that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped him by the arm-pits and pulled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pulled until he thought his body must tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in two. But he was going up! With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last of his strength he kicked his feet vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciously, trying to dislodge those straining,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinewy hands that gripped his legs. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, they let go. Like a limp bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sand he was hauled through the port,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay gasping on the flooring. "Quick!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he croaked. "The door. Close it." With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clang of metal against metal he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">it shut, and lay back, drawing in great</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungfuls of cool, refreshing air. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he clambered rockily to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes met those of Bjornsen. His hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out, and was clasped in the Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wegian's great paw. "Thanks," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "I shall never forget that." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head, and passed an aching arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his eyes. Some measure of strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to him, and with it the realization</seg><seg type="columnLine">that as officer in command, there was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be done. "To your stations, men. Pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pare to ascend immediately. Close the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner hatch. We're not safe yet. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">have our atomic drills, and if they start</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use them on the ship, we're lost. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayland, come with me.

"Engines ready, Jake?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked into the radiophone. "Stand by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very well, Mr. Wayland. Six ascensions</seg><seg type="columnLine">please."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayland gasped. "Six, sir! Why that'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">EXPEDITION TO PLUTO	79</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tear the ship to pieces. She won't stand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Adam fixed him with cool eyes. "I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">six ascensions, Mr. Wayland."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Way land opened his mouth to protest</seg><seg type="columnLine">further, then closed it with a snap. "Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, sir. Six ascensions, sir." He seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lever to the left of the control board,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved it to neutral, then shoved it hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. Six red lights glowed suddenly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the board. For a moment nothing hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, then deep in the bowels of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship a low. almost inaudible whine started.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like a siren it rose in pitch and tone, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it sounded like a hundred banshees scream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and wailing. A great shudder passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ship from stem to stern. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wounded beast struggling to rise she</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained upward from the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">icy ocean until it seemed she must tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself to flying, screaming fragments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayland's eyes were filled with fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paulette stared unblinkingly, breathless, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam. Little beads of sweat stole out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his forehead, but with a calm he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel he forced himself to keep his eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the panel before him. "Let me know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment we're clear," he ordered. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long minute no one spoke. Then from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control board a voice: "We're clear, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayland's eyes lost their wild look. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sigh heaved from his lips, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumped to trembling relaxation. Paulette</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered a single, glad cry, then sank gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor, while great sobs racked her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed head and trembling shoulders. "Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce to two ascensions, Mr. Wayland."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam's voice was hoarsely unsteady. "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">two minutes plot your course and shift</seg><seg type="columnLine">your engines. We're heading home." Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">in two steps lie was beside Paulette, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending over to pick up the sobbing girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He held her close, with her arms curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly around his neck, and her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried in his broad shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was a quiet group that gathered some</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours later in the main cabin of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Goddard. Every member of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew was there. Deep within the great hull</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engines were running smoothly. Out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the glassed ports the dark blue heavens</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched away on all sides. Like the shim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer of a thousand diamonds against a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">velvet backdrop the suns of the Milky Way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">danced and glowed. At Adam's side sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">.Wayland and Paulette. Adam looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">those before him. "At ease, gentlemen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the grace of good fortune we are on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way home. The expedition is a suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess. A success, that is, materially. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">you all know, we have lost Captain Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Causland and Dr. Reuter. If I am cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rect, you all know also the reason, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner in which we lost them. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain McCausland is not entirely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame. Perhaps it is given to every great</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to fail once. Whatever the reason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has always been--up to this trip--a hero</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all of us, and to the world. I must of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course make a complete report of his death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That report will be: 'Killed by the Plutoni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ans in defense of his ship and his crew.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a long moment no one spoke. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paulette, with tears of happiness dimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes, turned and gripped Adam's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her own. "My dear," she smiled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"thank you." As Adam turned to her, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt Wayland gripping his other hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly. "I understand, sir. Nothing will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be said." Adam smiled tenderly at Paulette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then his eyes turned anxiously to search</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of his crew. On every face was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">commending grin of approval. In every</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of eyes was a promise that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given, and would be kept. With a sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picious huskiness in his voice, Adam drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself erect. "Thank you gentlemen," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said softly. The crew filed out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With his arm around Paulette, he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">her gently to the starboard port, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to a dim, fast-receding, silver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">green orb. "There it is, darling. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know whether to curse it or bless it." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned at her quizzically. She came close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, and her arms stole gently about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "I'll bless it as long as I live," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He held her close. His head bowed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet her soft, red lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beg pardon, sir."

The Seven had won</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horta over finally by offering him all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth secrets of the red rays that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made Earth-Moon travel possible. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had even set up a ray reservoir in Horta's</seg><seg type="columnLine">great cavern, and had shown him how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harnessed rays could provide power for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships and explosive for sky-torpedoes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet Horta had never succeeded in building</seg><seg type="columnLine">any but tiny ships that could barely cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cle the Moon, and he had denied any suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess with the torpedoes. Only on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray-type and the ray-phone, essential to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth-Moon intercourse, had he followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions with real results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KinLUE rays, then?" muttered Ross,</seg><seg type="columnLine">XJ staring at Moore.

Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the great room, Artana led them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to low divans of stone, covered and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable with soft cellulose-like stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rustled as they moved.

"Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horta and his savants have made progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">in employing the R-ray, drawn from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red stars, as you taught him." He knit</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brows. "I have heard of nothing else</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but wait. He and his most learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">men have worked secretly for many moons,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	know not to what purpose. You think--'&gt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We think," cut in Ross grimly, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's possible that Lord Horta may be cook-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up something new in the ray field."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Artana's face darkened. "If that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">true," he murmured, "we may have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation of the disappearance of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my brigades. I sent them out in force</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scout Horta's territory. No word has</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from them." His hand clenched.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A war of rays--here on the Moon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROSS' and Moore exchanged uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable glances. They had fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the terrible war on the Earth when na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions battled with the new red ray, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole fleets of the ancient steel warships</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sunk by the first of the ray-torpedoes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the Council of Seven was formed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule all Earthly affairs. And they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">served in that first Moon-flight, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain with rays the first Moon armies who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had resisted the intrusion of the Earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet. Was history to repeat itself--in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse, with Horta's Moon machines raking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earth with death? Perhaps that</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange Purple Death of the Trowbridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">message ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross made his resolve. "If your armies</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't find out what Horta's doing, Artana,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps my fleet can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your fleet?" Artana looked up, a flicker</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hope in his somber eyes. "You mean</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that you would fly over the Caverns?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross nodded. "And study the work he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has done. Photograph it, and report to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and the Queen. If you then wish us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to try to destroy it, I'll take the respon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility. I feel that the Council of Seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">would approve."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Artana stood up, his eyes alight. "Ah,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross! If you succeed, and bring peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Moon people, your planet and mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do you homage!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross flushed sheepishly. "Well, maybe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For my part I'd rather be overlooked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know, there's an old, old saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I come from, 'A hero today, a bum</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A 'bum'?" echoed Artana, puzzled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A-a sort of--" Ross remembered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time that there were no beggars on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moon. Nor panhandlers, nor paupers, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">hobos. "Oh, never mind. We'll take off</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the first hour of light, and see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the meantime," Artana hastened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, "You must sleep." He ushered them</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a circular chamber, the elevator that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take them to the spacious under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">world of the Moon. Closing the door, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed a button. The resultant motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost imperceptible, but Ross and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moore knew they were being hurtled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Moon's core at hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour. Almost instantly the cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber stopped, the shock of cessation being</seg><seg type="columnLine">oddly cushioned. Artana opened the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the three stepped into the great ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunda whence radiated the life and activity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Province of Peak Four. Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">people hurried to and fro, only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to stare at the Earth-men. Bakers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hawking the curious brick-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">loafs of bread, and the fruits that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown from the seeds from the Earth were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacked on stands. Drapers stood by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">gossamer-like fabrics. Soldiers hurried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fro in squads, and their presence ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to Ross and Moore the inhab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itants' disinterest in the Earth-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spacious chamber to which Artana</seg><seg type="columnLine">led them was guarded by two tall sentries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tastefully furnished. The Lord of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Peaks cast a last glance about, said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I shall call you at the first light," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">88	PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moore sank gratefully down upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-piled bed. "Well, if this is to be my</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night's sleep, I'm going to do well</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're always worrying," chaffed Ross.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he lay, awake, mind racing, long after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moore's even breathing denoted that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chubby navigator's fears had succumbed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fatigue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ARTANA awakened them as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised. His first words were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the widowed Queen. "Boada is here," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Ross. "She has slept, and will greet</seg><seg type="columnLine">you after you have eaten."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They breakfasted in the chamber, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">food that Artana had commandeered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocket ship, with some of the pale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicious Moon pears beside the familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth fare. Artana talked fast as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two Earth-men ate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two of the Cavern men came in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Queen." As the two flyers looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in plain surprise, he smiled. "Yes, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were H orta's men. But they say they do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wish to serve him longer. They say</seg><seg type="columnLine">he plans to rule the Moon Kingdom alone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and will make war with the Earth."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two leaned forward, food forgot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten. "Did they say," asked Ross, "how</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horta plans to make war? With what</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Artana shook his head sadly. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">deny all knowledge of such things. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are star savants, and they say all Horta's</seg><seg type="columnLine">war secrets are known only to his war</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiefs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flyers' disappointment impelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Artana to go on. "They do say that Horta</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most of his forces arc gathered in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Cavern, where all his secrets are</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept. And that, too, is where he has set</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his ray machines."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross narrowed his eyes. "The Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavern, eh? Well, that's what we'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shot at."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You would have me accompany you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Artana asked eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, no, Artana. You are needed here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What if Horta were to make a sudden at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack? You must give us a guide, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show us the Great Cavern. And I will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> leave my chief signalman, Jorgens, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may keep in touch with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Artana assented, somewhat cast down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Truly, the Great Cavern held a secret,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Lord of the Peaks was as eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any to learn it. But he regained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerfulness as they sought out the Queen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was in the great chamber where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Artana had first received the Earth-men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Erect and haughty, she sat on the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">divan, regarding them with brooding eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they entered. So much Ross saw be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore his glance went to the slim figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside her, He caught his breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dream! A goddess! This girl--ah,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes, the Princess Illeria. But a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">now! Not the scrawny girl of five years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. Ross tore his eyes from her with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerk. Artana was presenting him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Queen Widow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "--Commander Ross, leader of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth-fleet, was a visitor at court five years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago," Artana reminded the Queen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She extended her hand, surveying him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a softening of her austere expression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he bent over it-she said in a harsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice that was obviously held steady with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an effort, "Commander Ross, you come at</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unhappy time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross murmured condolences, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged into the subject that was filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with impatience. ''I seek permission</seg><seg type="columnLine">from you, Queen, and from the Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">Artana to fly over the Caverns and report</seg><seg type="columnLine">on conditions there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Queen Boada darted a sharp glance at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Artana, then averted her head. "I see no</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion for such a flight," she said curtly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Artana stepped forward. "A rebellion,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">O	Queen ? Surely that is occasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She met his eyes, frowning. "But these</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not our people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yet," argued Artana, "the Earth people</seg><seg type="columnLine">are at peace with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross saw the Princess regarding her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother curiously. Moore, too, was star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in frank astonishment at the Queen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As she sensed their intent regard she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laxed her rigid pose. "Oh, very well. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there shall be no fighting?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"None, O Queen," Ross hastened to say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Artana nodded with satisfaction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There remains, then, the finding of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">WAR-LORDS OF THE MOON	89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">guide for the fleet. I could send</seg><seg type="columnLine">CaJisto--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Princess spoke for the first time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Calisto has not the gift of the Earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue. Who guides the Commander Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">must speak the tongue he knows best."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's true,'' muttered Artana, taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">aback. "Who. then--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Princess was looking at Ross.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almost hostilely, he thought con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusedly. Had she resented his long open</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare? She was such a picture, clad in</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a single filmy garment, caught at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist with a gold twisted belt and cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunic-like at the knee. Bare-armed, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly swelling contours and a skin like</seg><seg type="columnLine">peach down, she was an entrancing sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His confused thoughts were set at rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Princess had a plan. "I shall go with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Commander Ross," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Queen turned sharply. Artana</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowled. "No, no!" he cried sharply. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">there should be fighting--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fighting?" echoed Boada in a whip-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no, not fighting," Artana hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to correct himself. "But danger, perhaps."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Boada's brooding gaze came to rest in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiringly on Ross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There can be no danger, I think." he</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured her. And wondered why he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. For if Horta was on the war path,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely the Earth ships would be his targets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt his heart beat faster as he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered the possibility of this amazing girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing beside him in the control room</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his flagship, then a moment of depres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion as he reflected that the queen would</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuse her consent. But to his surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boada, after one dark look at the Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Peaks, nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They left at once. There was a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of delay when Illeria, given an oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet, demurred at the idea of wearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it until she was convinced that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">save her life if the shell of the rocket ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pierced in the upper air. She wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with ease, the straps fitting snugly over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flowing golden locks and the oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes crossing her face to add to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">piquant enigmatic look she wore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flagship took off with a rush, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six following ships keeping their distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Once in the air, they formed the echelon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Ross turned to the princess, and led</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to the telescopes trained through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She studied the crater surfaces wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, like a child with a strange toy. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she remembered her duty. "Sail there,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she directed, pointing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amusedly, Ross gave the order. Pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vately Artana had given him a full de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription of the Great Cavern, so that once</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had sighted it he could map his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. But the girl had guided him truly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a few minutes the yawning chasm lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He called Moore. "All the cameras set ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All set," grunted Moore, squinting</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a glass. "Going to skirt the cav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross nodded. "No use tipping Horta</seg><seg type="columnLine">off at the outset.

They turned, fearfully. The look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out's face was working. As they watched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears began to stream down his face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to speak, but he could only point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross sprang to the winddw. The sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear, save for the following ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Number Two, and Four, and Five. Six?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where was Six? And Seven? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled on the lookout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man gulped, drew a deep breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said huskily, "There was a flash, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--and then--nothing! Nothing, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Number Seven was flying! And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Number Six--went the same way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross and Moore stared frantically at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another. Then Ross sprang to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal post. "Jorgens! Where's Jor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gens?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A white-faced signal-man spoke up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's back at Peak Four, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes." Ross in his agitation had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten. "Well, signal Ships Two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three, Four and Five to sheer off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavern and return to Peak Four!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man sprang to obey. Ross turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to order the course changed. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing din that followed silenced him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His body hurtled against the stanchion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suddenly he found his arms about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Princess Illeria.</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HER body was soft to his touch, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">silky hair caressed his cheek, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath sweet on his face. But he pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her aside, and cried out to the helmsman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How does she fly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The helmsman, craning his neck as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">curled an arm about the wheel, shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, "On even keel, sir, but she won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">steer 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross pushed the Princess unceremoni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously from him and stood erect. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed to the window and saw with relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ship was circling away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crater. Gauges showed that the ship flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady except for that odd circling. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">artisan, bursting into the control room</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the after gun station, explained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One rudder flange haywire, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that's it!" Ross spoke calmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shot away?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's face worked. "Burned away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Burned--" Ross thought fast. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded to the artisan, who departed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scared look about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Moore had heard the report. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistled. "Burned away, huh? Sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a B-ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "B-ray? What's that?" snapped Ross.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"B for blue," explained Moore affably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Horta's draining the blue stars, or I'm no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harvard man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross eyed the navigator narrowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You really think that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What else?" countered Moore calmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Horta was a washout on the R-ray--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides, our red ray doesn't burn like that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think Horta's got something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross turned to the helmsman, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied the chart that Artana had pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided. "We can circle just like this, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make Peak Four if we can cut that drag</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit. Try reducing the speed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It worked. At reduced speed the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew more truly, with less pressure on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudder. Ross sighed in relief. "Keep her</seg><seg type="columnLine">there." He spied the Princess leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the stanchion, and walked over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Quite a scare, wasn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She regarded him steadily.

"Why do you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You pushed me away from you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, that 1" Ross was nettled. "A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">must fight his ship, Princess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes." She nodded agreement. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was afraid. I thought we were doomed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I wished you to be with me.

And you are the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wish for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross stared open-mouthed.

"You didn't get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock on the head, did you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head unsmilingly. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth-girls, they do not speak so to men ?''</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll say they don't," Ross assured her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" said the Princess Illeria in a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross didn't know what to say then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," he exclaimed, "we'll soon be back</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Peak Four."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was right. But grim news awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">them at the peak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ARTANA met them, his face a thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dercloud. He handed Ross a ray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">typed message. "This came just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you landed," he said tensely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Ross could read the message,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name signed to it caught his eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horta! The Lord of the Caverns was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming out of his silence! And with what</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greeting! "Know, O Queen," read</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horta's message, "that I have destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of the. Earth-ships, as I shall destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">all who fly against the destiny of the Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kingdom. Know, too, that I have de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed a second Earth city, the place called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Los Angeles, as a warning to the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">people that their destiny is not ours."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross read it with a sinking heart. Los</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angeles! A city of two million people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed! Then it was Horta who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped out Nagasaki!	\</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moore pounced on that thought. "Naga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saki, then Los Angeles!" he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross turned to Artana. "Any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">news ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Artana shook his head. "No. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a plan. You know that when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rains come we store them in the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">reservoirs, so that our under-world may</seg><seg type="columnLine">WAR-LORDS OF TEE MOON	91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not be flooded. Then why not loose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters in the reservoirs, and flood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caverns?-'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross stared in admiration. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly shook his head. "You'd have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill half your people, Artana, just to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose of Horta."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," argued Artana desperately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Horta will destroy half our people him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, to seize the Kingdom. And he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy the Earth folk, too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moore spoke up. "The reservoirs are</seg><seg type="columnLine">full?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," admitted Artana. "The rains</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not been heavy. The reservoirs are</seg><seg type="columnLine">but half full." He sighed. "Horta might</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape the flood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's no good, then," Ross said em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phatically. "Tell you what, Moore and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will go and scout the Cavern on foot. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be able to get near enough to the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">works to smash 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You would die," Artana said somberly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Horta guards his Cavern well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross nodded. "Maybe. But there's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other chance. Horta can knock us down</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the air, and he's knocking Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities to dust. He must be stopped. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">we die, you can hold out on the Peaks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flood him out when the rains come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right, Artana," Moore agreed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But let me go, Chief. I'll take a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of good men. You stay here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No dice, Harry," Ross assured him</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly. "I'm the head man and it's my job.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd like to have you along, though."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure," said Moore mildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Artana regarded them with admiration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are brave men! But what can I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Just sit tight, Artana, and wait for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain to fall," grinned Moore. "And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it comes, avenge us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will I!" swore Artana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY set out in the dark, Moore and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross and the guide whom Artana had</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated with a gesture. They had cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered only half a mile when Ross turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply, .suspiciously, to the guide. "Sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">you speak the Earth tongue?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded. "If you do, why can't you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">something ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The guide threw back the cowl-like head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">covering and Ross caught his breath. "II-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leria! What are you doing on this tour ?''</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I go to die with you, my lord," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the princess simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My lord!" squawked Moore. "Excuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">me!" He walked forward hurriedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross, his face burning in the gloom, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">Illeria's arm roughly. "This is no job for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Princess! There will be danger!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Even death," agreed the slim princess</seg><seg type="columnLine">equably. "No matter. And the Lord Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tana is agreed that I go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Artana agreed?" Ross was taken aback.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked ahead to where Moore waited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back over the way they had come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then shrugged. "Oh, well! Here we go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Happily Illeria caught his arm, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode forward. Moore chuckled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark. "Everything settled?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, dammit," grated Ross. "Did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever see such a mess?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moore's reply was sober. "We couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a better guide," he pointed out. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">we know the princess is loyal. How could</seg><seg type="columnLine">we be sure of some other guide ? A jigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">who might sell us out to the first Horta</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROSS grunted agreement, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">trudged on. They saw no one, heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one, until the first of the craters lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, and the Moon terrain sloped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down into the caverns. They came</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the first two sentries suddenly. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung their ray-guns up, but Moore was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quicker. His gas-pistol spat twice, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sentries crumpled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are they dead?" asked the princess,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dead to the world--er, I should say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead to the Moon," Ross assured her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They'll stay&gt;that way twelve hours, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to be long enough for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moore chuckled. "Before then we'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">on top of the world--I mean on top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Moon--or dead heroes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The way was easy, a steady down slope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a while. Then the rock formations</seg><seg type="columnLine">began. They slipped and crawled. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">princess suffered a cut on her knee, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged at the suggestion of a bandage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The second set of sentries were easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">overpowered. They lolled at ease against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ridge, and Ross shot twice to gas them</seg><seg type="columnLine">92	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep. Here the light was better, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross paused to look them over. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker than the Peak men, with less color,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their veins stood out against their</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue-white skin. They bore the ray-rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the Moon soldiers, and another curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous weapon besides, a jagged-edged sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a hooked point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the old Moon sword," said Illeria.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Horta worships the old customs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swears by the beliefs of the astrologers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's the astrologers who direct his actions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mother had said."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a dirty weapon," shuddered Moore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll take a ray-gun any time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came within an ace of regretting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice a moment later, when a whole squad</seg><seg type="columnLine">of soldiers rounded an outcrop of rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ross whispered a warning, and shot fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moore went into action then, but not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore one of the Horta men had fired. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray blasted past them and sheared off a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-ton of rock behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whew, that was close," gasped Moore</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the last of the soldiers fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about ray-guns now?" gibed Ross.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you know, I think we're in luck. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">party is evidently supposed to relieve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentries we met--so there'll be no alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">over their condition."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're right!" exclaimed Moore. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">all we have to do is to get to that ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stood within sight of it when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy hand of Horta fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the shadows of the cavern they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept from arsenal to foundry, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had inspected from tar or near every</seg><seg type="columnLine">establishment in this dim and fearsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">chasm. And finally they saw it, a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder nestling deep in the ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looming high in the cavern, supported by</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy beams of gleaming metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A ray-gun!" cried Moore. His incau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious exclamation was their undoing. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-clad foundry worker, looking like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnome in his eye-shade helmet and droop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gauntlets, gaped at them. Ross shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">a split second too late to stop the shout</seg><seg type="columnLine">of alarm. The foundryman dropped, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen soldiers came on the run. Moore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ross fired and fired again, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down in a charge of scores of Horta</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORMES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers. The flat of a sword struck Ross</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stunning blow on the side of his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came to his senses to find himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a strange room, bound hand and foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prone on a stone floor. Beside him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Moore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are we?" muttered Ross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In Horta's headquarters," whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moore. "Here's Horta."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross twisted his head. He blinked. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horta was an eyeful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Lord of the Caverns was a giant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fully seven feet tall, he must have weighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hundred pounds. But he bore his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great bulk with ease and a certain dignity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He strode over to the two prisoners, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">them over with curiosity but without visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble rancor, and spoke sharply to a guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Moon tongue. The guard hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to free the two flyers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They exchanged glances of surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You don't suppose he's a pal in disguise?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Moore blandly. He looked up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a start when he heard a rumbling chuckle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horta was amused. "No, Earthman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are prisoners. But I have no need</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bind you, for you cannot escape. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">you need not fear death, for if you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay and serve me you shall have life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the blessings that will be showered upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new Kingdom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "New Kingdom ?" Moore blinked. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Regency, isn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horta's great laugh boomed out "Nay!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am the King! And for my queen--</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, you have delivered her to me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross sat up and stared. "You mean--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Illeria?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horta chuckled as he nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Illeria!" Ross stifled a curse. His mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced. The girl was a prisoner, too. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke aloud, easily. "Well, I guess we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can give Your Royal Highness a hand."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hey, Bruce!" Moore expostulated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You don't mean--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?" drawled Ross. Turning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face Moore, he winked. "We know a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will pay our way with the new King-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moore blinked. "Of course!" he as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented hastily. "Sure!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horta stared suspiciously at the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">flyers. "Make sure, then, that you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no secret longings to return to Earth." he</seg><seg type="columnLine">WAR-LORDS OF THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">warned heavily. "For henceforth there</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall be no intercourse between Moon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth. The truce is ended."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross ventured a question. "What'll you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do with the men of the Peaks ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horta smiled grimly. "They will sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit, or die." He gestured imperiously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the guards pushed the flyers forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Horta strode from the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As they trailed behind, Moore whispered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He doesn't look like a killer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably a fanatic," Ross muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the play?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch our chance, and wreck the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And us with it," grumbled Moore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most likely," Ross agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They entered a softly lit room, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake of Horta. As their eyes became</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to the dim light they gasped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was Illeria. But beside her was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the queen--Boada 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE swept them with a glance in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt was mingled with a kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity. "You did not expect to see me here,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said harshly. "But I serve the destiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Moon. The wise men have shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that the Moon was never destined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve the Earth, but must stand with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blue Stars when the Universe is rent</seg><seg type="columnLine">asunder. And now the Moon is ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">defend itself, tiianks to the new King</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horta!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the silence that followed Ross heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl gasp. The queen spoke softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you, my daughter, shall be the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen, wife of the almighty Horta the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liberator."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not," Ross muttered between his teeth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"if I can help it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me, too," whispered Moore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl said nothing. But her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought Ross with piteous entreaty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horta broke the silence. "The nuptials</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall be solemnized in tomorrow's full</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. You, Earthmen, shall remain under</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard until you have given earnest proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your fealty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guards punched the two as Horta</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapped an order in the Moon tongue, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they allowed themselves to be led away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through a dim corridor they passed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a stone cell, with oddly fashioned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stone bars and a door that slid on a metal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">base, locking them into their tomb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross circled the cell, then shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. "We couldn't get out of this with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a ray machine," he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moore sat down against a wall. "Guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">not. Say, Bruce, did you hear the old'</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Universe is to be rent asunder,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted Ross. "Where does that leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Behind the eight ball, as I believe they</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to say back in the twentieth century,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned Moore. "That is, that's where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be if the Universe really were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be rent asunder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" grunted Ross in heavy sarcasm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So it isn't going to happen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gosh, no," chuckled Moore. "It's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silliest kind of astrological fake, discredited</seg><seg type="columnLine">two centuries ago. Where Horta picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up I don't know. Probably he got some</seg><seg type="columnLine">power from the blue stars by accident, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his faker astrologists strung him along on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big bust-up idea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nice clean fun," muttered Ross. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we missed. Horta's still got his ray ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine. He's also got the princess--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the queen for an ally."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's also," amended Moore dryly, "got</seg><seg type="columnLine">us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And how," grunted Ross. "How long</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you suppose we'll last if we don't--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped abrupdy. A faint noise came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his ears. "Hear that?" he asked, puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moore cocked his head to one side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Running water," he remarked. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't got a river down--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A scream, faint and far away, took his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath away. Another sounded, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chorus, dimmed by space and the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. Suddenly Ross and Moore whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Artana!" cried Ross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's opened the reservoirs!" gasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They leaped to their feet. Ross tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, savagely. Moore broke the skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hands on the stout stone bars of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window.

"Let's do something,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bruce! There's that ray reservoir.

For into sight, beside the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horta, walked Queen Boada. Moore ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed under his breath, fingering his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was the Princess Illeria who, snatch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the rifle from Moore's hands, leveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">it swiftly and fired.

"My</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother is an unhappy woman who stands</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the way of peace. Let me fire again !"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her demand left Ross irresolute. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he held her hand, Moore cried out. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">spotted that shot, Bruce! They're looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was true.

Ready--fire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two rifles spat together. Moore</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled, "You've done it!

"Long live</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Queen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ross glanced at Moore. The navigator</seg><seg type="columnLine">winked.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a well-known fact that the grotesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">little men from the red planet had a super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human sense of hearing that seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enable them to tune in on spoken conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions miles away, much as human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuned radio sets. They could hear through</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of brick, stone or steel; the one sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance they could not hear through was</seg><seg type="columnLine">platinum.

Humanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finally united to fight the common ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies--death, disease, old age, starvation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And on this nine hundredth anniversary</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Great Armistice, the people of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">World would have a great deal to cele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brate. Disease was now unknown, as was</seg><seg type="columnLine">starvation. Arduous physical labor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">abolished, for now, the heaviest and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest tasks were performed by ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines. Pain had been reduced, both phys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical and mental. Helpless senility was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of the past. Death alone remained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But even death had been postponed. Hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man beings now lived to be almost three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All in all, Dynamon mused, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolled along the broad avenue, the hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man race had eveloved a pretty satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory civilization. More was the pity, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that human restlessness and vaulting am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bition should have led to the construction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great Cosmos Carriers. If Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAVE-DWELLERS OF SATURN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had been content to stay on his own little</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, then communication would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been established with the jeolous lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle men of Mars, and this beautiful civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion would not now be threatened by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitation of the terrible Martians and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightful Photo-Atomic Ray. Dynamon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep chest swelled a little with pride at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that he had been selected by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commander-in-Chief to take an important</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in the coming conflict.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE turned the corner and found him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self standing before an imposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. Across the top of the facade in</seg><seg type="columnLine">block letters was the legend, "State Thea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of Comedy." A few minutes later he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in front of a doorway at the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great theater building. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened and a tall, lovely girl appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dynamon!" she exclaimed, "I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect to see you for another ten days."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stepped out of the doorway, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached her arms up impulsively, kissing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tall young soldier gripped her shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders hard for a minute, and then stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and looked down into her soft brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I know, Keltry," he said soberly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I had to report on short notice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" said the girl called Keltry, "are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you here on duty?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very secret duty," said Dynamon with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a meaning lock. He twiddled an imaginary</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio-dial in his ear and looked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysteriously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smile died on Keltry's smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown face, to be replaced by an expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of concern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean--them?" she whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon nodded. "Yes, I am being</seg><seg type="columnLine">transferred to a new post," he said slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and I thought, if you had no objections,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would ask to have you transferred along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you need -to ask a question like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?" said Keltry. "You know perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">well I'd have a lot of objections if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't ask for my transfer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There may be ■some danger," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving her an eloquent look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All the more reason why I should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you," Keltry said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOUR days later, a conference was</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking up in the platinum room be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the Commander-in-Chief's office. Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallum stood up behind his desk and care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully folded a number of big charts. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid one on tcp of another, making a neat</seg><seg type="columnLine">stack on the desk, then he looked keenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the four young men standing before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Once more, gentlemen," Argallum said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"for the sake of emphasis, I repeat--Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon has complete authority over the expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition. You, Mortoch"--looking at a lean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawk-nosed man in a soldier's helmet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"are in command of the soldiers. And you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thamon"--turning to a studious, stoop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered man--"are in charge of civilian</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities. And Borion"--glancing at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocky, broad-shouldered figure--"you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for the Carrier. But in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last analysis, you are all under Dynamon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders. This is a desperate venture you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on and there can be no division of</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a moment of silence. Argal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lum seemed satisfied with the set, deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined expressions on the four men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room with him. "Are there any further</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon shifted his feet uneasily. "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the decision--on Keltry, final?" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">huskily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid it is, Dynamon," said Argal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lum, gently. "I had the director of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theater over here for half an hour trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk him around, but it was no good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said he would under no circumstances</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare Keltry. He said she was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">promising young actress in Copia, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would forbid her to go on any danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous trip. Inasmuch as Keltry is stil! an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprentice, the Director has full authority</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her. I can do nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon drew himself up to his full</seg><seg type="columnLine">height and squared his shoulders. "Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir," he said briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well then," said Argallum, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't see you again. You will take off</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Vanadium Field promptly at four</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock tomorrow morning. Every one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one hundred and twenty-nine people on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expedition has his secret orders to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at three.

Mortoch, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decurion, and Borion, the Navigator, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">their leave of Dynamon and strolled away</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the West Gate. But Thamon, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">■scientist, fell in stride with Dynamon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For your sake, I'm sorry," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoop-shouldered scientist shyly, "I mean--</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Keltry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks, Thamon," said the centurion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It was a nasty blow.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess I'll just have to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--I just wanted you to know,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Thamon, "that I sympathized."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the middle of Vanadium Field a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray shape, like a vast slumbering</seg><seg type="columnLine">whale, could be indistinctly seen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft half-light of the false dawn. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights showed on the field and 110 sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heard. But scores of people clustered</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the sides of the Cosmos Carrier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfed to ant-like proportions by its great</seg><seg type="columnLine">size. Inside the Carrier, standing near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick double doors in the Carrier's belly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Dynamon, near him his three chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieutenants, Mortoch, Thamon, and Bo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rion. The members of the little expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary force filed past the youthful Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander, each one halting before him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brief inspection. One hundred brawny</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers, divided into squads of ten, stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the double doors, each squad led</seg><seg type="columnLine">by its decurion. Dynamon ran a practiced</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye over the equipment of each man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then for good measure turned him over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scrutiny of the Chief Decurion, Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toch. Then came twenty-five civilians, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluding ten engineers, four dieticians, five</seg><seg type="columnLine">administrators, and six scientists. But for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cruel prank of fate, Dynamon reflected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own dear Keltry would be a member</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the expedition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But there was no time for regretting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which could not be. Dynamon turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked toward Borion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you satisfied?" he asked the navi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gator. Borion nodded, and Mortoch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thamon likewise nodded in answer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon's unspoken question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said the young centurion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stations!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later the great outer door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cosmos Carrier swung silently shut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after which the thick inner door was se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured and the great ship hermetically</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealed. Dynamon followed the navigator</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the control room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is a gorgeous ship!" said Borion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's absolutely the last word.

Dynamon, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnets are so strong that this ship will</seg><seg type="columnLine">go at least ten times faster than anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that has yet been built. Once we get up</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the stratosphere, beyond the dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger of friction, we can go almost twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles a second. You ready for the take-</seg><seg type="columnLine">off? If you want to use the loud speaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">system just throw that switch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon nodded; a moment later his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was heard in every compartment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cosmos Carrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men, we are taking off. Hold your</seg><seg type="columnLine">stations for five minutes, after which you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may take your ease until further com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come and watch the altimeter," Borion</seg><seg type="columnLine">said after Dynamon closed the loud speaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch. "You won't believe we're off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, these controls are so smooth." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">centurion watched the needle creep gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward a few feet at a time. But he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel no trace of motion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to take her up vertically to</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thousand feet," said Borion. "Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll be clear of all obstacles and can pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">up our course horizontally--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, good," Dynamon broke in quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but don't tell me your course until we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the stratosphere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, aye, sir," said Borion with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wink, "little pitchers have big ears, don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How soon will we get out of the strato-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere?" Dynamon asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well. I'm lifting her very slowly," an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered the navigator, "I don't want to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">any chances on friction. I would say in</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAVE-DWELLERS OF SATURN	101</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">about three hours from now we will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will be with you then," said Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon, and walked out the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE young centurion had in mind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a thorough inspection of the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire ship, but he had scarcely been ten min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes away from the control room when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud-speaker system boomed forth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Centurion Dynamon is 'requested to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the control room." Dynamon hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried up a metal staircase and then through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a companionway. As he threw open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door to the control room, Borion turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly and laid a finger on his lips. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the navigator gestured Dynamon toward a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of glass panels. There were six of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these panels, each about a foot square, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged in two vertical row's of three each.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One word, "periscopes," was stenciled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top, and beside each mirror were other</seg><seg type="columnLine">labels, "port bow," "port beam," "port</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter." The other three panels were la-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beled in the same way, designating their</seg><seg type="columnLine">location on the starboard side. Borion</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicked the switch beside the "starboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter" panel and it become dimly illu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minated. Dynamon threw a swift glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the altimeter, and saw that it said two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet. Then he bent over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered into the periscope panel. A wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">panorama of twinkling lights spread out</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him, the street lights of Copia. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pale blue of approaching dawn was</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping fast over the city, shedding just</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough light to reveal a dark shape a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the Cosmos Carrier, and perhaps a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet below. As Dynamon stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the periscope screen, he thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could detect a faint glow of red in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following shape. He turned questioningly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Borion. The navigator was writing rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly on a piece of paper. A second later</seg><seg type="columnLine">he handed the paper to Dynamon. It said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I queried Headquarters and was told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the conference with the Martian dele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gation is still officially going on. But that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carrier following us is bright red, the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Martian Carriers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DYNAMON held the piece of paper in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand for a minute and gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtfully into the periscope screen. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he took the pencil from Borion and, bend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over, wrote the following:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like the looks of this. Can we</seg><seg type="columnLine">outrun them once we get out of the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Borion nodded slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As far as I know, we can," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"unless--" he reached for the paper in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon's hand and wrote "--unless they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have developed a new wrinkle in their Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riers that we don't know anything about."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," said Dynamon, "we won't waste</seg><seg type="columnLine">time worrying about things over which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no control. Proceed as usual."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There followed some anxious hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Dynamon spent with his eyes glued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the periscope mirror. In a short time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the early golden raj's of the sun appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Martian Carrier followed behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexorably, glowed an ugly menacing crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. Once Dynamon instructed his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munications officer to speak to the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lovely morning, Mars. Where are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you bound for?" was the casual message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came back a terse answer, "Test</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight, and you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're testing, too," Dynamon's com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munications officer said. "We'll show you</seg><seg type="columnLine">some tricks up beyond the stratosphere."</seg><seg type="columnLine">All so elaborately casual, Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought grimly. It was fairly evident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian ship intended to follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth Carrier to find out where it was go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Those inhuman devils! Why did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth's people ever have to come in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact with them?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon's thoughts went back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">childhood, to that terrible time when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of Mars had abruptly declared war</seg><seg type="columnLine">and descended suddenly onto the Earth in</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of Cosmos Carriers. Only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">timely invention of that remarkable sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, Geistfactor, had saved Earth then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a creamy liquid, which spread over</seg><seg type="columnLine">any surface, rendered the object invisible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The principle underlying Geistfactor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">simplicity itself, being merely an applica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of ultra high-frequency color waves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it saved the day for Earth. The World</seg><seg type="columnLine">Armies, cloaked in their new-found invis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ibility, struck in a dozen places at the rav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aging hordes from Mars. The invaders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of their prodigious intellectual</seg><seg type="columnLine">102	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">powers, could not defend themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">against an unseen enemy, and had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to withdraw the remnants of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">army and sue for peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the unremitting jealousy and hatred</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little men with the giant heads for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth's creatures was leading to new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. It enraged the Martians to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that human beings, whom they despised as</seg><seg type="columnLine">inferior creatures, should have first</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of spanning the yawning distances</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the planets of the solar system.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was doubly humiliating to the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">that when they, too, followed suit and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">in for interplanetary travel, they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do no better than to copy faithfully the hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man invention of the Cosmos Carrier. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only too evident that Mars was gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering its strength for another lightning</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust at the Earth. This time, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Photo-Atomic Ray, there was no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they intended to destroy or subjugate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth's peoples for good. And to that end</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martians had been inventing new bones</seg><seg type="columnLine">of contention and had been contriving new</seg><seg type="columnLine">crises. A peace-minded World Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment had been trying to stave off the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitable conflict with conference after con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference. But to those on the inside it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only too evident that the Martians could</seg><seg type="columnLine">invent pretexts for war faster than Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">could evade them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DYNAMON, watching the blood-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carrier in the periscope mirror, felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a surging bitterness at the Martians. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could only be reasonable, he reflected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if only they could be human, then he, Dy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">namon, would not now be floating away on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dangerous mission far from the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the woman he loved. He tried to im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agine what Keltry was doing at that mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. In his mind's eye he could see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stage of the Theater of Comedy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthralling audiences with her youthful</seg><seg type="columnLine">charm as she played a part in the latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">witty comedy, or sang a gay ballad in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new revue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke out of his reverie and tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glance at the altimeter.

"Just about," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and put his hand on a lever marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">''gravity repellor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As the navigator pushed the lever</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly forward, Dynamon turned back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the periscope mirror and saw the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship behind suddenly dwindle in size. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">new Cosmos Carrier was beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show its speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently, the Martians were momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily caught off guard. The red Carrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminished to a tiny speck against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark background of the Earth. But then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it began to grow in size again as the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians unleashed the power in their great</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Borion, how about friction?" Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We don't have to worry about that</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet," was the answer, "we're not going fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. And the temperature outside is</seg><seg type="columnLine">about sixty-five below."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon nodded and glanced again at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the altimeter. The needle was steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing, a mile every ten seconds. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again he looked into the screen of the peri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope. The Earth was now far enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">away so that the young centurion could be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin to make out the broad arc which was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the curving circumference of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe. Silently he said a final good-bye to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keltry and turned to speak to Borion. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment the door of the control room</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst open and an engineer stepped in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saluted the navigator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stowaway, sir " the engineer said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just found her in the munitions com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon stared out through the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">door at the woman who stood out there</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two soldiers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Keltry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was a harried and heartsick centurion</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, a few minutes later, called a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference in his own quarters. Borion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thamon sat regarding him gravely, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mortoch, the second in command, lounged</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall, a faint, derisive smile on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lean face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are faced with a situation," Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon said heavily.

I, person-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, can't see that it makes so much dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference.

"It may be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">close shave at that," he admitted.

In this fantastic encounter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every second counted. Could the naviga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor elude the pursuing red Carriers ? Bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion haunched tensely over the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">levers, his eyes glued to the screens. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian ships were as big as cigars now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tripling their size with every heartbeat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon clenched his fist involuntarily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought down an impulse to shout a warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. That would be worse than useless now</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the fate of the expedition was entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hands of Borion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon held his breath as a flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">red flicked across the port bow periscope</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen. The Carrier heaved under his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a second then quickly settled to an even</seg><seg type="columnLine">keel again. The sweat stood out in little</seg><seg type="columnLine">drops on Borion's forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too close for comfort," muttered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigator. His eyes widened as another</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge red shape loomed up in the starboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow screen. Borion's hands flicked over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dial spinning a needle around. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung desperately back on the repellor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a momentary shock. The Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rier seemed to bounce off something. Bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion staggered and Dynamon hurled for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and crashed into the forward bulk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the control room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Borion shouted, "We're through!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon picked himself up off the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a rueful smile.

That was a bad minute there!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Borion excitedly. "I thought that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow was going to get us, but I kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off by throwing the beam on him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving him the repellor. But you can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">for yourself, they are far behind now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'll never in the world be able to catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon peered into the port and star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board quarter screens and saw a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly diminishing red specks.

"I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to run for the shadow of the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from there I'll plot a course straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Jupiter, avoiding Mars entirely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE door to the control room opened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a smiling, spectacled face peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in.

"Were we trying to knock down</seg><seg type="columnLine">an asteroid?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon gave a short laugh. "No, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely some of our friends from Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to head us off.

Until we actually land the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no conceivable emergency that</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't be handled by a skeleton crew."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Quite right," said Dynamon.

"As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of fact, the first Cosmos Carrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">was anticipated hundreds of years ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just the other day in the library, I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very interesting account of an archaeolog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical discovery made up in North Central</seg><seg type="columnLine">3A--the island that the ancients called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britain. A complete set of drawings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">building plans was found in an admirable</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of preservation. The date on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans was 1956, and as you will remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">from your school history, all of North</seg><seg type="columnLine">Central by that time had been terribly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravaged by the wars. The inventor, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">name was Leonard Bolton, called his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trivance a 'space ship.' Wonderful, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">old names, aren't they? But the most re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable thing of all, is, that the designs</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that 'space ship' were very practical.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the man ever had a chance to build one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he probably didn't, it might very</seg><seg type="columnLine">well have been a successful vehicle."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's very interesting," said Dynamon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Were there any clues as to what happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Leonard Bolton?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None at all," the scientist replied.

But, as I say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remarkable thing is that when we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">around to building a Cosmos Carrier eighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, we were able to use several of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leonard Bolton's ideas.

The images that</seg><seg type="columnLine">106</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were reflected in the six panels made up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">composite scene that was awe-inspiring and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearsome. The great Cosmos Carrier was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally arriving at the end of its seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">months' journey. In front of the Earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft, a vast, barren expanse, uniformly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark gray in color spread for thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles. To one side of the Carrier a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt of mist and shimmering particles</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched upward from the planet out</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward space. Dynamon realized that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a small section of the great ring en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling Saturn, that could be seen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful telescopes from Earth. Glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the stern vision screens, Dynamon saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun twinkling. So far away it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now-, that it was hardly bigger than a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">star and gave off not much more light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even though they were coming to Saturn in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of a Saturnian day, there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a gloomy half-light to illumine</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Saturn revolves on its axis with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed," observed Borion, "that I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine there will be tremendous prevail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing winds on the surface. I think I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a range of steep mountains down there;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might not be a bad idea if we landed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lee of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," agreed Dynamon, "I think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a good idea. As a matter of fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may have to dig below the surface en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely to prevent being blown away. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the gravitation pull?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a curious thing," Borion replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It should be tremendous but the centrif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugal force is so strong that it counterbal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances to a certain extent.

"That</seg><seg type="columnLine">will give us just time to turn off the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frigeration and bring our people back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.

"But I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">bored now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon walked across the control room</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw a large switch in the wall panel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Decurion Mortoch and Scientist Tha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon," he said into the loud-speaker sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem.

He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be dissatisfied with the altimeter reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed forward the repellor lever a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little more. Then he looked again at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">altimeter, and an expression of bewilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment came over his face. With a muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation he jammed the repellor lever</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far ahead as it would go, at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time watching the altimeter. Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensed that something was wrong as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the color drain out of the naviga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Saints preserve us!" the navigator</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried hoarsly.

The ground was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing up at a terrific rate, and out behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Carrier, a dense cloud of black smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forming. The veins were standing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Borion's forehead as he inched the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tractor lever forward. The girl and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men watched him with bated breath as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slowly raised his eyes to the altimeter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A wild incredulous expression appearing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the navigator's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's--it's working!

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">column of smoke behind them was still there</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it seemed to be thinning out. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of Saturn seemed to be rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward just as fast as ever. Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted his head around to look at Borion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A feverish smile was lighting up the navi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gator's face as he pressed forward on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attractor lever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We may just make it!" he breathed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon said a little prayer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the screen a range of dark gray moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains stood out in bold relief and seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach claw-like peaks toward the speed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Carrier. But the smoke had ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whip past, and only a small black cloud far</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind served to remind Dynamon of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful friction that the surface of the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been subjected to. At the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon felt an invisible force dragging</seg><seg type="columnLine">him toward the front bulkhead of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol room, and he knew that the Carrier was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowing up its forward speed. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bow periscopes the jagged range of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains seemed so close that Dynamon al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">108	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">most felt he could reach out and touch them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miraculously, they rose up to one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.

How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, Dynamon was taking no chances. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced briefly at Thamon beside him.

There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of a creeping, crawling, or flying crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture ; nor was there any vegetation, trees or</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass. Dynamon led his column nearly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile down the unchanging gray of the val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley and then called a halt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thamon," he said, beckoning the scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist to him, "can you see any possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human habitation in this valley?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Off-hand, I don't, not on the surface,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scientist replied. "I would have to test</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atmosphere for oxygen, but I doubt if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is a large enough proportion. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess is that there is nothing but nitrogen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this air. That won't support human life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or any other kind of life except possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain kinds of plants."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about tridium?" said Dynamon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How do you go about looking for it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Electrophysiological tests of all kinds,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Thamon, "I must say this valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't look very encouraging. It looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">like burned out volcanic ash. Say! What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">that up the valley?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon gazed back in the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cosmos Carrier, and felt an uneasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">prickling along his spine. The desert val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley floor behind them seemed suddenly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have sprouted some tall bushes. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly a dozen of them standing at in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervals of twenty yards. They were too far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away--perhaps one eighth of a mile--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon to see them very well, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to consist of a score of leafless</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches radiating outward in all direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions from a small core. It was as if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">basket ball was bristling with ten-foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">javelins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did they come from?" Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon gasped. "I didn't see them when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked over that ground a few minutes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nor I," agreed Thamon. "I can't imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine where they came from."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then one of the bushes apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved a few feet as if blown by the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord!" exclaimed Thamon. "Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see that?

Dynamon felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hair on the back of his neck stiffen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he sprang into action, commanding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers to converge around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thamon, what are those things !" Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," the scientist replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't think they can be animals. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might be rootless nitrogen-feeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants of some kind. Look! Those branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">are covered with long thorns!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fantastic creatures were rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly down on the little group of humans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dynamon could see the sharp thorns</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the end of each branch. He reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the box at his hip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Decuria, ready with voltage bombs,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he commanded, and looking around saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that each man held one of the little glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombs in his hand. The bushes were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty feet away now, rolling lightly over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gray sand on their spindly branches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ready?" warned Dynamon, "throw!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shower of glistening glass balls flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air into the midst of the menac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing apparitions. There was a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding flashes and loud reports. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">jagged white lines appeared among the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches of the monsters, but they kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">right on rolling downwind. Dynamon felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a surge of dismay. Those voltage bombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been, for years, Man's best weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're plants all right!" came Tha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon's voice. "You can't kill them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">electricity any more than you can kill a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon looked at the men huddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him and thought quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All we can do, men, is to try and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodge them," he announced. "Spread out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as soon as one of those things passes</seg><seg type="columnLine">you run upwind! Keltry! Thamon! Stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE line of rolling bushes was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them as the soldiers deployed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all directions. Seizing Keltry by the hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon leapt to one side dragging her out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the path of one of the spiney monsters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thamon gasped a warning, and Dynamon,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turning his head, felt a thrill of horror as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw another of the creatures almost on</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of them. Acting instinctively, Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon snatched the metal staff from Tha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon's hands and flailed frantically at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, thorny branches. To his amazement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they shivered and snapped under the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod like matchwood. Hardly daring to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve his eyes, Dynamon struck again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again at the horrible creature, until in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes it was nothing but a pile of scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, broken faggots on the gray sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But cries for help and screams of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guish sounded in Dynamon's ear phones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he saw that five of the soldiers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground impaled on the cruel thorns</seg><seg type="columnLine">of others of the monsters. He ran toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and beat them to pieces with the rod</seg><seg type="columnLine">but too late to save the lives of the men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They lay pierced in a dozen places by long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black thorns. The rest of the Decuria had</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to dodge the whirling branches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other bushes and now stood safely up</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind of them. Dynamon summoned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">survivors around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you think, Thamon?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "In your opinion are there likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be more of „these horrible things</seg><seg type="columnLine">around?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There may easily be," the scientist re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied promptly. "But since the only de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense against them is this one metal rod,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I recommend that we leave our unfortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrades here and head immediately for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains over there. Those poor fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low's are beyond our help and we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to find better protection from these</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-thirsty thorn-bushes among the foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills.

As the bomb ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAVE-DWELLERS OF SATURN	111</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded, the momentary flash revealed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party that they were at the foot of a steep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock-strewn declivity. Dynamon led the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party upward, feeling his way over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great boulders. After a few minutes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing, he called another halt and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw a voltage bomb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll stay here for a few hours," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">centurion announced, "until it gets light</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to see our way.

Dynamon demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Keltry," came the answer. "I am just</seg><seg type="columnLine">going up hill a little distance.

Just then, he stood rooted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror as a piercing scream rang in his ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dynamon! Dynamon, I'm falling!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Keltry!" the centurion exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's the matter? Has something hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to your helmet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes!" Keltry's voice was fainter. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost it! It was unfastened, and when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled, it rolled off!" Fainter and fainter</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew the voice. "I'm falling down a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole a mile a minute!" With a muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">sob, Dynamon scrambled up the slope. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later, his foot stepped out on empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. He started to fall into nothingness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keltry!" he cried into his transmitter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where are you ? Answer me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Straining his ears Dynamon heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny voice far away saying, "I'm still fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm coming after you, Keltry!" the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turion yelled, and reaching up to the knob</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his helmet, twisted frantically. By do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that, he multiplied the gravitational pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet and was now falling much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more swiftly than Keltry. How deep this</seg><seg type="columnLine">black pit was, Dynamon had no idea, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he prayed it would be deep enough so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could catch up with Keltry before she</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit the bottom. It was a desperate chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Dynamon was willing to take it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keltry!" he shouted into the transmit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. "Can you hear me? I'm coming for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I hear you, Dynamon," came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, and Dynamon's heart leapt as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to him that the voice sounded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little stronger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep your courage up, Keltry,'' he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to sound calm. "I'm falling faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you are. There doesn't seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">any bottom to this pit so I'm bound to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch up with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Dynamon! You shouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped after me. There's--there's only--</seg><seg type="columnLine">one chance in a million that we don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KELTRY was bravely trying to hide the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispair and terror in her voice, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">most important of all to Dynamon was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that she sounded--stil nearer! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolutely put out of his mind the frightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability that at any second, first Keltry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he, would be dashed to pieces at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the pit. It seemed to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had been falling for miles, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that there was beginning to be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">air resistance now. He bent his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered downward, trying to pierce the inky</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness with his eyes, but he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. It was a fantastic sensation or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">better still, a lack of all sensation. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be resting immobile in a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothingness, with only the rushing air tear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at his cloak to indicate that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep talking, Keltry," he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you sound so much nearer!" There</seg><seg type="columnLine">112	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was a note of incredulous hope in Keltry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you I'd catch up with you!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon exulted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, his heart gave a great bound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was still peering downward and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">'seemed to him that far away he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tiny pin point of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keltry!" he cried, "am I seeing things?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or is there something that looks like a star;</seg><seg type="columnLine">way down there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I think I see it!" Keltry answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathlessly. "Dynamon, what could that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," said Dynamon, "but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be growing larger, and I'm get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting much nearer to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under his fascinated eyes, the star grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger and brighter by the second. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments Dynamon, hardly daring to</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe his eyes, thought he could make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outlines of a flying figure between him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keltry!" he shouted. "I've almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught up with you! Hold your hands up</seg><seg type="columnLine">over your head."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh Dynamon! I think I can see you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The point of light which Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought was a star, was growing into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger, brighter disk. Keltry's body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply outlined against it now, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be scarcely ten feet away. Dy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">namon bent himself into a jack-knife dive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kicked his feet up behind him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">air pressure was tremendous now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon began to realize that it was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">star, or sun, or planet down below but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the pit. Rays of light spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward, illuminating the smooth, shiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of the shaft. A few more agonizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds went past and Dynamon's hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazed the tips of Keltry's upraised fingers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon dared not estimate how far above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the pit they were, but con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated on gaining the few inches he</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed to get a grip on one of Keltry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've--almost--made it!" he panted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here--grab my right arm and hang on</seg><seg type="columnLine">for dear life!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An involuntary shout of relief came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Dynamon's lips as he felt Keltry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong fingers close over his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' "Hang on!" he shouted, and his left</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hand flew up to his helmet and carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the counter-gravitation knob. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time, he twisted his back around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fought his feet downward. A mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment later, he gripped Keltry's torso under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arms with his knees. Frantically, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to estimate how far above the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom of the pit they were. They might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">five thousand feet--or five hundred feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly he turned the dial on his helmet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resisting the almost insuperable impulse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">twist the knob too fast. If he tried to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fall too quickly it would tear their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies apart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, ever slowly, the air-rush dimin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished. By now, they were well down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the area illuminated from the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit. And they could see that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling through a round shaft perhaps one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet in diameter. Dynamon judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were less than one hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out, Keltry," he said. "I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put on the brakes hard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gritted his teeth, and flicked the knob</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his helmet. He stifled a groan as in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible ropes attached to his feet and hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be trying to pull him apart. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually the terrific pressure released. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved the knob a shade, and released the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip of his knees on Keltry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There!" he grunted as they both landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly on solid ground. "There wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">two seconds to spare."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KELTR\ drew a shuddering sigh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put a hand on Dynamon's arm for</seg><seg type="columnLine">support.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Dynamon!" she whispered, "if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't such a well brought-up girl I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">break down and cry from sheer relief."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't blame you," said Dynamon in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a voice that shook a little.

Now, where do you suppose we are?</seg><seg type="columnLine">How do you suppose this pit was ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two Earth-people stared around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them curiously. They were bathed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright light, and yet there was no apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of illumination. It began to dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">011 them that the rocks which formed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side walls at the base of the shaft, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves luminous, glowing with a curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAVE-DWELLERS OF SATVRN	113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ous greenish light. Dynamon tilted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head back and stared up into the darken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shaft. Suddenly, he uttered an exclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and, seizing Keltry by the wrist</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged her to one side. A few seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, a round object dropped out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft and bounced on the ground. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keltry's counter-gravity helmet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon reached down and picked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. "It's a good thing that these things</seg><seg type="columnLine">are well built," he remarked with a smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"or this would be smashed to bits. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob is still set for plus ten pounds, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was quite a fall. I wonder whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">it still works."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He twisted the knob experimentally and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helmet started to sail upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say!" Dynamon cried. "It works, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right! Here, put it on Keltry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Keltry accepted the helmet with a laugh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it on her head and was buckling it</seg><seg type="columnLine">under her chin when her blood suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">congealed in her veins. A loud shout rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoingly through the shaft. Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled around and beheld a curious figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in front of a rock not sixty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. It stood upright on two legs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cradled a sort of club in its arms. Its head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was covered with long, yellow hair that fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on to its shoulders, and the lower half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its face was covered with coarse, yellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. Blue eyes glinted from under shaggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows in a menacing glare at the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth-people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It Jooks quite human, doesn't it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered Keltry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dynamon nodded arid slid his ear phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his right ear as he saw the stranger's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairy mouth opening and closing. Keltry</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed his example in time to hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger's rumbling voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whoo-yoo?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon touched Keltry's hand. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded like 'who are you' didn't it?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said wonderingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It certainly did." Keltry answered. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that's some kind of human."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If it's a human," Dynamon said, "then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there must be some sort of breathable at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere down here. You notice he's not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing any oxygen mask."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Whoo-yoo?" the stranger repeated, "an</seg><seg type="columnLine">whey cum fum?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">8--Planet Stories--Winter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's speaking a kind of English!" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keltry excitedly. "He said, 'who are you'</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 'where do you come from!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Jupiter!" cried Dynamon. "I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're right. If he can breathe without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mask, so can we. I'll have a little talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later the centurion stood bare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed, helmet and oxygen mask in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're humans from Earth," he told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger, pronouncing each word carefully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who are you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger's eyes and mouth flew open</seg><seg type="columnLine">in astonishment and the rod sagged in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Humes! Fum-Earth!" he cried hoarsely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turned his head, and gave an ear-split-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting yell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A MOMENT later, a dozen or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, hairy-faced creatures closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling the first stranger came tumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a passageway behind him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood rooted with astonishment at the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dynamon and Keltry. Their bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">were completely covered, the torsoes, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose, gray tunics, and the legs with ugly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggy tubes. They advanced cautiously on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two people from Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take off your helmet and mask," Dy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">namon directed Keltry, "the air is per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly good. We'll try and find out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery of how these humans ever got</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and addressed the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger, again enunciating slowly and care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. Immediately the whole crowd burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">into excited jabbering. Here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon thought he recognized a word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, one man taller than the rest stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yoo cum thus," he declared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly," Dynamon nodded with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, and reached out a hand to Keltry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crowd, with wondering eyes, opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a line and the two young people from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth followed their self-appointed guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it. A short narrow passageway</seg><seg type="columnLine">led off at a sharp angle through the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the pit, and presently Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Keltry found themselves on what ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be a hill top. Both of them gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">little gasps as a vast and magnificent pano-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rama spread out before their astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">114	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. It was as if they had stepped into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A gently undulating plain stretched away</seg><seg type="columnLine">in three directions as far as their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see. It was predominantly gray in</seg><seg type="columnLine">color, but here and there, were scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, narrow strips of green. These green</seg><seg type="columnLine">strips all had shimmering, silvery borders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dynamon couldn't help recalling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind some arid spots back on the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were criss-crossed with irrigation</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditches. There were no trees on this vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, but strewn around in a haphazard</seg><seg type="columnLine">wav, were a quantity of great boulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And these rocks, like the rocks at the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pit, glowed luminously. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landscape was clearly illuminated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other source than those scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks. Dynamon lifted his eyes upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw that above them, and stretching</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as the eye could reach, there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly luminous ceiling. There was no way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of telling how high up this ceiling was. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be twenty feet or twenty miles. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect was like that of certain days on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, when wide-spread clouds blanket</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky and diffuse the sun's rays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plain was by no means deserted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here and there along the green strips four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legged creatures moved slowly, creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, on Earth Dynamon would have said</seg><seg type="columnLine">were cows. Nearer at hand, a flock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small white creatures milled around aim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly, and Dynamon could have sworn he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the cackle of hens. Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced over his shoulder and saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little hairy-faced men were filing out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passageway to the pit. The guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">tugged at his sleeve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This oo-ay," he said and pointed to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still holding Keltry's hand, Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and followed the man, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others fell in behind them. Their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually led toward a tall set of cliffs at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of which a score or so of cave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like openings could be seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These are humans, aren't they, Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon ?" Keltry whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They certainly look like it," Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered, "although obviously they're very</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then how and when did they come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturn?" Keltry persisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I haven't the faintest idea," Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged. "Perhaps we'll find out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Other strange humans came running up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hill and joined the crowd behind them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently they were not all men, for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them had no hair on their faces and wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">long robes over their bodies. The guide led</seg><seg type="columnLine">them straight to one of the openings in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff, then halted and faced the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventurers impressively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''The koo-een!" he announced in a loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon and Keltry looked wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly at each other and then back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide. At that moment a woman appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the mouth of the cave. She was small</seg><seg type="columnLine">and delicately formed and strikingly beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful. She had the bluest of eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden hair that fell away on either side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a marble brow. A long-sleeved white</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment gathered at the waist covered her</seg><seg type="columnLine">from neck to toe, but its shapeless folds</seg><seg type="columnLine">could scarcely conceal the delicious curves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her little body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Humes!" the guide shouted proudly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"fum Earth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE woman's blue eyes widened as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she stared solemnly at Dynamon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keltry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you from Earth?" she said in slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">musical tones. "So strange! So wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful ! How did you come ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon grinned. "We came in a Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mos Carrier," he said easily. "And to us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seems even more strange and more won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful that we find humans already on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shy answering smile came over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's beautiful face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have been here hundreds of years,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she replied in the same slow accents. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">come inside the Palace and we will talk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned with an inviting look and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two adventurers from Earth followed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a passageway lined with the, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, familiar luminous rocks. They came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in a fairly large, high-ceilinged room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center of which was a sort of table</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out of a long, trimmed slab of rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At one end of this table was a high-back</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair made of woven reeds. The woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked over to the chair and sitting down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it, indicated stools on either side of her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAVE-DWELLERS OF SATIRN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">115</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down," she said, "and tell me more</seg><seg type="columnLine">about yourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you," Dynamon answered, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to his companion said, "It's warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">in here, I think we might take off these</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloaks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keltry nodded, and putting her hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throat fastening, zipped it downward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon did likewise and the two stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of their cloaks. There was a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream from the beautiful little woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her hands flew up in front of her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you doing?" she squealed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why you're--you're practically naked!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're positively immodest!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keltry threw a startled glance at Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon's long, brown legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, not at all," she said quietly. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are dressed like everyone else on Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the present time. Modesty with us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowadays, is something much more impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant than lengths of cloth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little woman kept her hands before</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes and shook her head vigorously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's immodest," she insisted, "and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must put on your clothes at once. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you realize that I'm the queen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reluctantly, Keltry and Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back into their heavy cloaks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">zipped them up the front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well! that's better," said the little queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">primly. "My goodness," she said with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight glance, "is everybody on Earth as</seg><seg type="columnLine">big and brown as you two?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're about average, I should say,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keltry answered with a smile. "And seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, we didn't mean to offend you in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of clothes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well we, on Saturn," said the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen, "don't believe in indecent exposure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, you say you came in some kind of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrier ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Dynamon. "It's up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface.

Dynamon explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the counter-gravity helmets. It took con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable explanation, because the queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inclined to disbelieve the whole story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She finaly accepted it, however, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">launched into a long series of questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Cosmos Carrier and about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of the Earth. Eventually Dynamon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">found an opening and started asking ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions 011 his part.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're anxious to know about you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">your people on Saturn," he suggested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have you a name or are you addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only as Queen ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Queen Diana," the little woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated. "The last of my, line. I am a Bol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, and the Boltons have been rulers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saturn ever since we came here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bolton!" Dynamon shouted. "Are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a descendant of Leonard Bolton?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes!" replied the queen, with a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted smile. "Do they still remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leonard Bolton on Earth?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We know that he designed a contrivance</seg><seg type="columnLine">called a 'space ship', but that's all. Did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually build such a ship, and is that how</seg><seg type="columnLine">you come to be here so many thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from Earth?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Queen Diana, proudly. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all down in some books which I will show</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Leonard Bolton built a space ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was big enough to hold ten families</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their belongings. There was a ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible war going on and he thought the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to find safety was another planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So the 'space ship' left the Earth by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a thing called a 'rocket,' whatever that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is. And they wandered around for years in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space till they finally came into Saturn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit, and the tremendous gravity pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship right through the light outer crust</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this Nether World. I don't know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">many years ago that was, but we have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">here ever since."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well that is an amazing story," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon. "And I would like to see those</seg><seg type="columnLine">books you mentioned. How incredibly for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunate that the 'space ship' broke through</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this Nether World, where there is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">asmosphere that will support life. And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is pretty miraculous too, that the 'space</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship' didn't break up from the force of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitting the outer crust."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, the books say that it was broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">up somewhat," the queen answered, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody was hurt. And after they unloaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship, they took it apart so that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could use the metal in it for other things."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was eying him admiringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the colony has survived over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand years," Dynamon mused. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not help thinking how, in comparison</seg><seg type="columnLine">116	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with the people on Earth, the survivors oE</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bolton's expedition were a rather poor lot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had made no progress at all in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand years, mentally or culturally;</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all evidences they had, on the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trary, retrogressed at least to a degree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then across his mind flitted a picture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hardships these brave souls had to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dure in establishing themselves on the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. At no time could they have even</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped to return to Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With their limited equipment they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out to make the most of their new</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. The great caves offered natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter so it was small wonder that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">made their homes in them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon, although a soldier to his finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">tips, had none of the haughtiness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruelty which are so often found in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors of today. Quickly his pity for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonists turned into admiration, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned gently to face Queen Diana again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me," he asked, "Are we the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers you have seen? You haven't, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any chance, been visited by Martians, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Martians," said the queen. "What are</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At present, they are just about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst enemies of human beings," Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied tersely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said the queen, "our only enemies</seg><seg type="columnLine">here are the land-krakens. We have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting them for hundreds of years and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have never been able to exterminate</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, because they're so hard to kill."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Land-krakens," said Dynamon. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of creature are they?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are great, crawling monsters,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the queen told him. "They have a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, flexible arms that curl around their</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims and strangle them.

The queen stood up quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one of her subjects rushed into the cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Land-kraken!" he shouted. "Ter'ble</seg><seg type="columnLine">biggun!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITHOUT a word, the queen picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up her long skirts and ran to the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance of the cave, Dynamon and Keltry</seg><seg type="columnLine">following close behind. An extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight met their eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the foot of the little hill, fifty or sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting men were ringed around a hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible mass of thrashing, gray tentacles. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral of the men were pointing their black</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods at the beast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it is a big one," the queen cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Our guns will be useless against that thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide--the bullets will just skim off."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were several more reports and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke curled from the ends of the rods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several long, grey tentacles rose up above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mass, and the crowd surged backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all directions. Suddenly one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slimy arms streaked downward and out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and a moment later a struggling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming human was lifted high in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. A thrill of horror went through Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon, and Keltry clutched his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Their ancient fire-arms are useless,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said in a tense whisper. "Perhaps a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voltage bomb--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Dynamon was already running down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope, fumbling at the black box at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hip. The concerted groan of dispair from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd suddenly changed to a shout as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unfortunate human somehow tore loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the encircling tentacle and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground. Just as the land-kraken was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching for the doomed man with another</seg><seg type="columnLine">long arm, Dynamon hurled a voltage bomb</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the heads of the crowd. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass ball landed squarely in the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the writhing gray mass. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding flash and a loud report. A con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsive shudder rippled over die gray mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster and its twelve tentacles suddenly went</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp. The crowd looked at it in stunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence for a second, and then raised a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell of triumph. A noisy mob of little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearded men escorted Dynamon back up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hill to where the beautiful little queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, waiting, her blue eyes shining.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How marvelous! How heroic!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed, as Dynamon came up to her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You killed the kraken with one blow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How did you do it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you see. Queen Diana," Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon replied, patting the black box, "these</seg><seg type="columnLine">little voltage bombs have long ago entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAVE-DWELLERS OF SATURN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced fire-arms on Earth.

"Send the girl away if you want"--</seg><seg type="columnLine">she waved a careless hand at Keltry--"but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must stay here with me forever."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DYNAMON saw Keltry's startled eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him and he felt an acute embar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rassment. It was an impossible situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could not repress a little glow within</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from the frank approval of the beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful, imperious little queen. But at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time, he knew that he must soon de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise some means of making a graceful exit</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her presence. His thoughts were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrupted by a sudden cry from the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the surrounding crowd. He turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and looked along the base of the cliff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A column of cloaked figures, helmeted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked, were streaming out of the passage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a search party coming after us!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried Keltry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were twenty or so of the soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Earth, and they covered the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Dynamon and Keltry in a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and forced their way through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd of bearded Saturnians. The one</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lead unfastened his oxygen mask</seg><seg type="columnLine">and revealed the spectacled face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thamon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank goodness, you're alive!" said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist fervently. "We never expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find you. What a fantastic place this is!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are in the kingdom of the Bol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons," said Dynamon, "and this is Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diana."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man behind Thamon unmasked, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealing the lean, dark features of Mortoch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Congratulations. Dynamon," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief Decurion, dryly, as he in turn was</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented to the wide-eyed little queen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You certainly picked a sort of paradise to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall into. A paradise, I might add, pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sided over by an angel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A coy smile crept over the queen's face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then died away at Mortoch's next words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I bring you grave news, Dynamon," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief Decurion said. "There are two Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian Carriers in the vicinity. We haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen them yet, but we intercepted a long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave conversation between them. What do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you intend to do about jit ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, I think we should go right back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the surface," Dynamon replied. "Could</seg><seg type="columnLine">you tell from their conversation whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew that we were on Saturn?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Apparently they knew we were some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where around," said Mortoch, "but hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">located us yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, we'd better hurry right on up</seg><seg type="columnLine">then," said Dynamon, "so that we can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to our Carrier before they find it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, but you can't go!" said the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen in a shrill voice, "I forbid it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish we could stay, Queen Diana,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon answered, "but there's dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to be done up on the surface."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why go to the surface at all?" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen demanded. "Why not stay down</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and keep away from the danger?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, Queen Diana," Dynamon said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keenly conscious of Mortoch's lurking</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. "Duty calls and we must go. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps when we have finished our work we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will pay you another visit. All right, men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here we go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE centurion, Keltry by his side, led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way back to the entrance to the pit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the Saturnians, grouped around their</seg><seg type="columnLine">little queen, gaped after them. As the lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle force stood in the bottom of the pit ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justing their helmets and oxygen masks</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparatory to ascending to the surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mortoch leaned over to Dynamon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That wasn't such a bad idea of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful Diana's," he murmured. "Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonally, I wouldn't mind spending a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe years down there with her. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be better than facing those deadly Photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atomic Rays of the Martians."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it's safety you're interested in, Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toch," said Dynamon, dryly, "we'll try and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get you, as soon as possible, to the safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Carrier. Anyway, perhaps the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians are just exploring and didn't come</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped with the Ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as the centurion turned the knob in</seg><seg type="columnLine">118	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his helmet and shot up through the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft, he felt in his heart no great hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such, indeed, would be the case. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martian Carrier were in the vicinity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Saturn it was altogether likely that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come prepared to destroy the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carrier, and wouldcbe equipped with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">best weapon. Dynamon hoped against</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope that he and the little force would</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the surface in time to get to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own Carrier, whose thick walls the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians' Ray could not penetrate. After that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be a case of maneuvering the Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rier in such a way as to try to disable the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians' ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The humans, their gravity repellors</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned up full strength, whizzed up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black shaft at a tremendous rate of speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even so, it seemed hours before a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray disc above him warned Dynamon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were nearing the top. He spoke some</seg><seg type="columnLine">words of command into his radio phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cut down his upward speed. In a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments he stepped over the rim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft into the gray light of the Satumian</seg><seg type="columnLine">midday. He glanced down into the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the Carrier and felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock of dismay go through him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE gray Earth Carrier was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same place, but a half a mile on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of it were two flaming red Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carriers. And out on the gray sand far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from any of the ships a furious battle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on. Some twenty tall, human figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ringed around by a swarm of tiny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">globular Martians. A continuous series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white flashes showed that the humans were</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately hurling their voltage bombs, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the encircling Martians were keeping well</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of range and a dozen still forms on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground showed that the invisible Photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atomic Ray was doing its deadly work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All too clearly, Dynamon saw what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. In the absence of a command-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing officer, himself or Mortoch, Borion had</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwarily sent a force of soldiers out scout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The Martians had swooped down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed swiftly, and cut off the force from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Carrier. The humans were desperately</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to cut through to safety, but their</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation looked hopeless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly, Dynamon turned and faced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men behind him and held up his hands in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a gesture signifying that no one should</seg><seg type="columnLine">use his radio phone. He had determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to "try and help his beleaguered soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the valley, and the only way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could successfully be done was to surprise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack swiftly on the rear of the Martians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He motioned Keltry and Thamon back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit and then, sweeping his arm forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a wide arc, he plunged down the hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. But before he had covered half the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance to the combat in the valley, Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon realized that his attack was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late. The Photo-Atomic Ray was cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting down the little force of humans like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an invisible scythe. There were only nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them left now and one by one these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were falling. A thousand thoughts raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Dynamon's head. Should he go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead with the attack, counting on getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">within bombing distance of the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnoticed, before they could swing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">Photo-Atomic Ray around? Or, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">he change direction, skirting the enemy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make a run for the Carrier? Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, his blood froze in his veins as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice sounded in his ear phones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is suicide, Dynamon!" It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mortoch's voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's suicide now!" said Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">through clenched teeth. "You fool! You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have given us away!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an instant reaction from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming Martians in the valley. A large</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of them broke away from the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bat and rolled over the gray sand toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon's detachment. The centurion</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted his men abruptly. It was sure an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nihilation to try and stand in the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oncoming men of Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Back to the pit!" Dynamon com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded. "It's our only chance. Once we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get down there we'll decide what to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little force just barely made it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mouth of the shaft. The Martians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming up rapidly behind them, and Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon could see the big, black cones which</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced the invisible Ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE descent down the shaft was rapid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon being the last to land on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiny floor. Immediately, he marched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men through the passageway into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nether World and detailed two men to</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAVE-DWELLERS OF SATURN	119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">remain and guard the entrance to the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't believe the Martians will follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">us down," he said. "If they do, we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily defend the passageway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he turned and singled out the Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Decurion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mortoch," he announced, "you are un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der arrest. You disobeyed my orders in</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard to using the radio phone, and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing so you betrayed our presence to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. I will dispose of your case later."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mortoch stepped forward, a sardonic</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam in his dark eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And suppose I refuse to be arrested?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "If I had not disobeyed the or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, you would have led us into certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">death." Mortoch swept the crowd of sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers with a burning look. "Men, I pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim that Dynamon is incompetent to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand you. Henceforth, you will take your</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders from me--and you, Dynamon, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one who is under arrest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mortoch!" Dynamon cried. "You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of your mind!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not at all," Mortoch returned. "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely assuming the command which</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been mine to begin with. Put</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hands up in the air, Dynamon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward march till I tell you to stop. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">let nobody else make a move"--Mortoch's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasping voice rose to a shout--"I have in</seg><seg type="columnLine">each hand a voltage bomb which I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hesitate to throw if anybody attempts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cross my will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is madness!" Dynamon cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarsely. "You can't hope to get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this!" He strode forward angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Back!" roared Mortoch, and raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand threateningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon staggered back in bewilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment from the soldiers who stood in si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence, too shocked to make a move. Help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less against the voltage bombs in Mortoch's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, the centurion stepped slowly back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, arms upraised. It wras an impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation, and for the moment, Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt powerless to do anything about it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproached himself bitterly for not being</seg><seg type="columnLine">more wary of Mortoch. Up till now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been conscious of the Chief Ducurion's</seg><seg type="columnLine">enmity, but he had never thought that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man would erupt into open mutiny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon threw a swift glance over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and saw that he was only two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">paces away from one of those curious, lu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minous rocks. It was approximately cyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">indrical in shape, six feet wide and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet tall. Dynamon took another</seg><seg type="columnLine">step backward and turned his head to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mortoch. His back was almost touching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rock now, and a desperate plan formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his head. That was 'to make a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap around the rock. Once behind it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected by its mass, he would have time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pull out one of his own voltage bombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and await Mortoch's next move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT Dynamon had not truly measured</seg><seg type="columnLine">the state of Mortoch's mind. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sudden scream from Keltry as Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toch, with a lightning movement, drew back</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right arm and flung the voltage bomb</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight at Dynamon's chest. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass ball sped unerringly across the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vening twenty feet. There was no time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodge. Dynamon pressed his back against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rock and closed his eyes. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon felt the little bomb bump his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest. But--wonder of wonders! There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no blinding flash--no explosion. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just a silvery tinkle as the glass ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered at his feet. Dynamon opened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and found that he was still alive. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulous shout went up from the horri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied crowd and Thamon started running to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tridium!" shouted the scientist. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have discovered tridium!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As in a dream, Dynamon saw the sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers overpowering Mortoch and heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself say, "What do you mean? Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the tridium ?" He stared about in wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The rock!" cried Thamon excitedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You touched the rock and were instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulated against the electric charge. Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens! What a discovery! Every one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these luminous rocks must be made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tridium."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon turned around and placed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on the glowing rock. Instantly, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt himself enveloped in an extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent aura.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You seel" cried Thamon, and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the rock with his metal rod. Evidently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was almost as soft as chalk, for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces as big as a man's fist chipped off and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to the ground. Thamon stooped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">120</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and picked one of the pieces up and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately he, too, stood in a curious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming aura.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's tridium, all right I" exclaimed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist. "There can be no doubt about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. We knew it was on Saturn and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what its properties were, but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know what it looked like. Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize what this means, Dynamon? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">means that we may finally have found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense against the Photo-Atomic Ray!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon felt a little dizzy. Not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he been snatched from what appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be certain death but he had inadver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently made a discovery that might save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of the world from conquest at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of the Martians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thamon, are you quite sure?" he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Are you quite sure that this will work</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the Ray?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," replied Thamon promptly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't be quite sure until we've tested it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out From a theoretical standpoint, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing cloud, this aura that surrounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">us as we touch a piece of tridium should</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulate us against the Ray. But to be ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely certain, somebody will have to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose himself to the Ray. Someone among</seg><seg type="columnLine">us must go up to the surface holding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of tridium in his hand and face the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians. If he is killed, then I'm wrong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But if he is not killed, then the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">are at our mercy. We can walk up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them untouched and crush their egg-shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">skulls with our bare fists."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," said Dynamon gravely. "Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of us must be a heroic experimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">guinea pig?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," said Thamon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon looked over the silent group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of soldiers, at Mortoch, shoulders hunched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the grip of two stalwarts. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed his head in thought for a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men," he said, finally, "this is not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of calling for volunteers. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one of us is brave enough to offer his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life for the good of the rest of the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings, but I think we should decide who</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to do this dirty work by drawing lots."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Mortoch. In his eyes was a wild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted look, and his voice was hoarse, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was deep sincerity in his tones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dynamon," said the Chief Decurion,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I went off my head with jealousy a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute ago. The madness is gone now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would give anything if I could undo</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I did. You must give me the chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to redeem myself. If I am killed, so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">the better for me. And if I am not, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much the better for all the human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon looked long and searchingly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Decurion. Finallv he said, "Mortoch,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	cannot deny your appeal. Take this piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tridium and go up the shaft. We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be close behind you to observe the experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then, there was a shout from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two soldiers who were guarding the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sageway to the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Martians!" they cried. "They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming down on us! The shaft is full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon walked straight toward Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toch and placed the piece of tridium in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand-.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your ordeal is at hand," he said cimply,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as, in a flash, the bright aura transferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself to the person of Mortoch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE two soldiers guarding the entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the pit were backing away to either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and throwing voltage bombs into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passageway as Mortoch ran toward them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop!" he shouted, never slackening his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace. "This is my job! Get out of range!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He halted six feet away from the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the passage and raised his arms up in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture of defiance. An admiring gasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">went up from the crowd of watching hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans at the tall, lean figure bathed in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous glow. Then a deathly silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut down abruptly as four little figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">erupted through the passageway. Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were scarcely two feet tall, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">spindly little bodies and legs, but their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads were more than twice the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human heads and looked doubly grotesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their combination helmet-masks. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them was holding a big, black cone--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Photo-Atomic generator. Quickly the lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle creature leveled it at Mortoch and pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lever on the side. An ominous high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched hum filled the air and everyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the death Ray was being poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all its deadly violence on Mortoch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAVE-DWELLERS OF SATURN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">121</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thamon was the first to raise his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a shout as Mortoch, unharmed, strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and felled the Martian with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow of his fist. The air rang with human</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheers as Mortoch siezed two more scur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rying Martians by the legs-and dashed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains out on the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It works!" Thamon yelled, hysterically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's tridium! We're saved!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientist was hacking crazily at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock with his metal staff and jubilant sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers swarmed around him, picking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of tridium. In a few moments the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole force, every man surrounded by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous aura, was bolting through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passageway into the bottom of the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a short time the Martians tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put up a battle. But with their chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon nullified, they were slaughtered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dozen, and the survivors began flitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the shaft. In the midst of the turmoil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon kept his wits about him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that in order to realize the full value</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trklium discovery, the Martians on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface must be kept from learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">about- it. He raised his voice in a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout over the clamor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Masks on! Up the shaft at full speed!</seg><seg type="columnLine">We must not allow a single Martian to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the surface!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly the Earth-soldiers fastened their</seg><seg type="columnLine">masks and took off straight upward. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them clung to their precious lumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tridium, and in a short time the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft presented an extraordinary spectacle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each of the twenty-odd humans was bathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his own ghostly envelope of light, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fleeing Martians, looking downward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have felt as if they were being pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued by a squadron of giant fireflies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The survivors of the massacre below</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a head start of their pursuers, but be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing so much lighter in weight, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity-repellors could not push them up</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the atmosphere as fast as the hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans could go. Gradually they were over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken and destroyed by Dynamon's force</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the last Martian being caught just at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper mouth of the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DYNAMON quickly gathered his. men</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him while he took stock of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation in the valley. The three Carriers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the same position as they were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">before, but there were no Earth-soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">left standing. A little circle of fallen bod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies offered mute testimony to the hopeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle put up by the force of three decuria</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had made that ill-fated sortie from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Carrier. Now, the Martians from both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the red ships--excluding, of course, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group that had been cut to pieces in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit--were gathered in a body near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth Carrier. Dynamon guessed that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were waiting to see what the Earth people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going to do next. They would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out, the centurion thought grimly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even though there were probably close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred of the evil little creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">down there, they would be no match for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brawny humans insulated against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Photo-Atomic Ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly, Dynamon formulated a plan of</seg><seg type="columnLine">action. His first consideration was to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seize both Martian Carriers. If pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, they must be prevented from leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground and carrying back to Mars the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning that, at last, the humans had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a defense against the Ray. With that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, the centurion divided his little force</seg><seg type="columnLine">in two. One decuria with its decurion he</seg><seg type="columnLine">put under Mortoch, and the other, he com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded himself. Each group was to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">boldly at one of the Martian ships, Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toch the nearer one; himself, the farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamon issued his commands by signs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping to remain unnoticed by the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he refrained from using the radio-phone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as he led his group off along the hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, a sudden activity among the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the valley told him that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighted. They came streaming across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley floor toward the heights on a shallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">crescent, each wing spreading to perform</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enveloping movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What an unpleasant surprise the nasty</seg><seg type="columnLine">little devils are going to get! thought Dyna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon, and he switched on his radio-phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Follow me, now, on the dead run!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dug his toes into the yielding gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand and ran along the hillside, bending</seg><seg type="columnLine">low into the wind. It was heavy going, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the humans were able to make faster prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress than their enemies because of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater weight. Dynamon saw that he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his group were outrunning the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would probably reach their objective</seg><seg type="columnLine">122</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner. Two thoughts arose in his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to worry him. One was, that the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians inside the red ships might lock their</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors and take off before he and Mortoch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">respectively, could reach them. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the fear that Borion, inside the Earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carrier, not knowing of the new defense</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the Ray, would sally out in a des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate attempt to save--as he might think</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the two isolated detachments of humans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, Dynamon reflected, those were</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventualities over which he had no control.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All he could do under the circumstances</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avas pray for good luck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A GLANCE down into the valley told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that he and his little force were</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast of the Earth-Carrier by now, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half a mile still to go to reath the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian ship. The Martians, running parallel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were falling behind a little. Rapping out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a command into his transmitter, Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed his direction slightly, and swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">downhill on a direct line with the red ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same time, he and his men read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justed their gravity-control so that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed was almost doubled. Away to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, the Martian horde was dropping be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind. Dynamon gave an involuntary</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout of triumph. He and his party was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to win the race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the little knot of speeding humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached within a hundred yards of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian Carrier, another cheer broke from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon's lips. The door at the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Carrier swung open and a score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">little creatures carrying the once-dreaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">black cones tumbled out. The Martians in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the ship, far from running away, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming out to fight--mistakingly confident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the twelve humans were at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Quickly, Dynamon issued orders that two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his men should immediately penetrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inside of the Carrier and seize the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol-room, while the rest stayed outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and engaged the Martian warriors. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting for breath, but none the less con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fident, the decuria closed in on the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were within twenty-five yards of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dwarf-like little creatures before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians discovered that something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amiss with the Photo-Atomic Ray. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly little men hesitated in momentary</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismay, and then started to make a dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the inside of the Carrier. But by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, it was too late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The twelve humans, clothed in their life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preserving auras, swept down on the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians like avenging angels. All the pent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up hatred against this diabolically cruel</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy now found release. At last, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian superiority in weapons was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken. Dynamon and his men waded im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placably into the terrified little ogres and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slew them without mercy. The whole busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was over in less than two minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without the loss of a man, Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had annihilated the defenders of the Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rier, and two of his soldiers were inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">in possession of the control-room. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained now the job of handling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred or so Martians who were moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the gray sand toward his victorious</seg><seg type="columnLine">decuria.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this force of the enemy had realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that something was radically wrong. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no longer running, but, in fact, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowing up to a halt about fifty yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Dynamon swung an arm and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to walk toward them. The black cones</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up, pointing, all along the long line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Martians. Dynamon's men fanned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on either side of him, walking forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, inexorably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The line of Martians wavered uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly, and then began to fall back in ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rified confusion, as the humans remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">unharmed by the Ray. Dynamon's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackled in nine sets of ear-phones, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the decuria lunged forward. In a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were in the midst of a panic-stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of scurrying Martians. Again, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers from Earth slew pitilessly, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a short while, fifty-odd of the harried</seg><seg type="columnLine">little creatures lay dead. The rest were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered in headlong flight over the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE business was accomplished none</seg><seg type="columnLine">too soon. The thing which Dynamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had feared might happen earlier, happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. A force of humans, unprotected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">tridium, emerged from the big gray Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rier and hastened toward Dynamon. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes earlier and these men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been mowed down by the Ray. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">centurion sighed with relief and ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">CAVE-DWELLERS OF SATURN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the newcomers back to the Cosmos Carrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The danger was over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty minutes later, Dynamon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined forces again with Mortoch's detach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and was marching back to the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pit, where Keltry and Thamon were</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting. The past hour had seen a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete and sweeping triumph for the hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans. Mortoch's attack on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martian ship had been as successful as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dynamon's. Now, both of the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carriers were captured, and their crews</seg><seg type="columnLine">and warriors cut to pieces. And, all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been accomplished with the loss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">but one man. One of Mortoch's soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen and dropped his lump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tridium. The man had instantly died un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the Photo-Atomic Ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There remained only one more piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">business to conclude successfully the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedition to Saturn, and Dynamon set about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it promptly. Once again he led the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the pit to the Nether World.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was great excitement at the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom of the shaft. The Saturnians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposing of the bodies of the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had fallen in the first onslaught when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mortoch had proven the efficacy of tridium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, as Dynamon landed among them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely followed by Thamon, Keltry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soldiers, the Saturnians crowded around</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an condition bordering on hysteria.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had never before seen Martians, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">even dreamed of their existence, so it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be wondered at that the primitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans of the Nether World were excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the sudden, fierce combat broke out</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost in their midst. With the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty, Dynamon quieted them down</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough so that they heard and complied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his request to be taken to their Queen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Queen Diana," he said directly, "in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your kingdom, you have any quantity--</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of tons--of this luminous rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we have identified as tridium. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance is the one thing which can save</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people of the Earth from the death -</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray of the Martians.
