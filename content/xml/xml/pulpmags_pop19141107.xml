                <seg type="columnLine">a German army officer of high rank. Cameron introduces the two men who are destined to become deadly</seg>

                <seg type="columnLine">intercepts a charging uhlan, throwing the horseman to earth and into unconsciousness. Thus Martin gets</seg>
                <seg type="columnLine">the precious fuel, and flys into the night sky, the Zeppelins still after him. Von Hollman then appears
