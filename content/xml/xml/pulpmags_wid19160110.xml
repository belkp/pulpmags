            <seg type="columnLine">arrives at his home, where he finds his father, Dugald Stewart, and his younger brother,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Denis. After resting, Ben takes up the pursuit, but is wounded and returns home. Denis</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dons his brother's uniform and takes up Cowley's trail. The "substitute trooper" meets</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with various exciting adventures, and is eventually made a prisoner by Cowley and Smok-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing Duck, a Cree Indian. Stewart is removed to Cowley's camp, where he is left in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">charge of Smoking Duck. He succeeds in making his escape, and, without weapons, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">continues his flight. He meets Napoleon McShayne, a French Canadian, in whose com-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pany Stewart encounters Bray, a fur trader, who is on his way to Cowley's camp on Hay</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Lake. From the trader Stewart learns that Cowley has been purchasing an unusually</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">large amount of corn. Stewart orders Bray to return to Fort Vermilion. A plan is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arranged with McShane to secure Stewart's canoe and rifle, which had been left on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">river bank when Stewart was captured. The trooper swims the river, and while he stands</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">drying himself and clothing over a fire, two canoes appear on the river, -which prove to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be occupied by Ballard and his friends, all of whom are in search of Cowley. The set-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tlers have made up their minds to deal with Cowley in their own way, without the inter-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ference of the law. During the night Stewart escapes from Ballard's camp, and makes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his way to the point where he is to meet Napoleon McShayne.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">you feel when you read his description of a contest of any kind that the author</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knows what he is writing about, that he has been right down there himself,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">tell about them in a most interesting manner. His plot is always a good one,</seg>
