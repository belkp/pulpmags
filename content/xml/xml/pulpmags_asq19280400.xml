When the magazine was first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">launched, we had no original manuscripts at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all. Little by little, as the magazine continued</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to grow, original scientifiction manuscripts began</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to arrive, and it became possible to have less and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">less reprints. The initial issue of Amazing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stories contained 100% reprints, that is, stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all of which had been published before. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tendency now however, is distinctly the other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way. In the current issues of Amazing Stories,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the only reprints published are some of the stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Jules Verne and H. G. Wells type, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which there seems to be a constant demand by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">many readers who have not seen these classics</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When we brought out the Year Book last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Summer, we featured only one original story,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The Master Mind of Mars," by Edgar Rice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Burroughs. All other stories were reprints. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first Quarterly, three months ago, contained</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only one reprint--H. G. Wells' famous story,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"When the Sleeper Wakes." All other stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were original.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And now, the second issue of the Quarterly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">contain 100% new stories, all of them original.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This again, is an experiment, in the first place,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">because until very recently, there were not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enough new scientifiction stories to go around,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and secondly, because the few that were sub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mitted, were not always good enough to publish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But times are rapidly changing. Scientifiction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">may now be said to have arrived with a bang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">More and more authors of the better kind are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taking to scientifiction as the proverbial duck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">takes to water. It is a great source of satisfaction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to us, and we point to it with pride, that 90%</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the really good scientifiction authors are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Americans, the rest being scattered over the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world. Wc believe that America will in time,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">become known as the hotbed of scientifiction, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that more excellent scientifiction will be turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out in this country than anywhere else. Already,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in our editorial opinion, our modern authors have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">far eclipsed both Jules Verne and H. G. Wells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We know that is a broad statement, and one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of vast import, but it is true, nevertheless. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">takes time for a new art to develop and while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we are not as yet at the top, we arc slowly get-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ting there, certainly, and the movement of sci-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entifiction will sooner or later assume proportions</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">far exceeding the expectations of most of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Just as there are cycles in style, there are cy-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cles in literature. During the last few decades,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for instance, there were cycles of the expose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">story; then we had the boys detective cycle; next</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the real detective stories; more recently the sex</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">story; and still more recently, the self confession</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">story. These are only the outstanding distinct</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">types. Of course, there are many others. But the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scientifiction cycle is now in its ascendancy and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is growing rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Next Issue of the Quarterly Will Be on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Newsstands July 20th</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By Frederick.

They had been classmates a few years</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, when the Imperial German Government elected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dictate to the sovereign people of these United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States, as to when, where, and under what conditions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships might sail on the high seas, without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to Davy Jones' locker by German submarines. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the days that had followed, had come the dissolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ties,--family, social, and fraternal.

Some day, his mono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphs may be found, red</seg><seg type="columnLine">penciled with the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and vetoes of a corps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of efficiency experts, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">just reward of whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">merits lies in the fact, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have been entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten in the era of post</seg><seg type="columnLine">war progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry Scott, soldier of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune, gentleman vaga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bond, artist and rover, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">served overseas in a var-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iety of capacities. His war</seg><seg type="columnLine">posters were much sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in England, France, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">America, to stimulate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">encourage the various</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches of service. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">played and sang his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hearts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doughboys, and organized</seg><seg type="columnLine">amateur theatricals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">minstrel shows to reinspire flagging spirits. His unfail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing optimism and contagious flow of good spirits, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a great favourite with both officers and men, and led</seg><seg type="columnLine">to many special details where the morale of the troops</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed stimulation. Thus, he substituted at first aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stations on the fighting front when doctors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarce; had an ambulance blown from under him by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell near Verdun; captured six Germans in one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Argonne; and, after the armistice, went blithely</seg><seg type="columnLine">jon an extended tour to little known corners of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">.world, finally turning up in New York, after a lapse</seg><seg type="columnLine">•of some two years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the night in question, the conversation had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted to the Limitation of Armaments Conference,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then in session in Washington. Some one ventured</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opinion that Secretary Hughes was playing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foxy hand--he knew from the results of recent naval</seg><seg type="columnLine">tests of bombing planes, that battleships were things</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the past. Holden remarked that it would be only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of a few years before airplanes in war,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would likewise become obsolete. Another member of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the group had opened his mouth to question Holden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons for such a statement, when Jerry Scott, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been rummaging through a newspaper, suddenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped up with:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God, did you see</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Bob?

Jules Verne, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   instance, wrote good science in his fiction,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   but there was little literature contained in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   it.

It was big as a house, and as I looked across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chasm, I saw her. She had just come out to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">first aid to a wounded doughboy in the hole, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-armed gorilla type Austrian officer was pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">her back to cover; she resisted and tried to wench</seg><seg type="columnLine">free from his grasp. It took a moment for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the situation clear, then I saw the Austrian whip</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a revolver and his arm-swung out and down for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pot shot at the Yank. Thatm'Sde me mad clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">through; it was the sort of thing that hadn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">done since early in the war, and just then she knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand up. He struck her with his clenched fist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It had all taken place in an instant, but each sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arate movement was etched into my mind, like a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of motion pictures flashed on a screen, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing the big hole to find Jack Rutherford, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head supported on the arm of the nurse, drinking from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her flask. The Austrian, with blood streaming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw, escaped into the doorway of a house on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper edge of the hole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scott passed his hand over his eyes, as if to erase</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene from his brain, and then resumed. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">God only knows how she got him back behind our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines, for I had to leave them there and go on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the boys; couldn't stop to help a wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">pal you know, that was orders. But that nurse was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as cool and self-possessed as if she were sitting on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench in Central Park.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We were driven out of the village half an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, when the Heinies laid down a barrage that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced it to gravel, but they were gone when I passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hole on the way back. I didn't see them again</seg><seg type="columnLine">until after the Armistice. It was then that she told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me about her life. It seems that she had foreseen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the war, and wanted to get away from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Austrian, who had been pestering her with his atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions and wanted to marry her. Jack had been plugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the arm and leg. She had nursed him through</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever and shell-shock, and when I ran across them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris, he was coming round to the old Jack Ruther-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford again, except for occasional fainting spells and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some queer lapses of memory at times. I was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them when they were married, then I slipped away--</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave her my best pal and went down to the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">where King Tut once ruled, to try and forgot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumphs that civilization had brought to the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack was going to return home, leaving her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">straighten out some matters concerning her father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">estate.

Approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its mid-ocean destination, the staccato from its ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausts was diminished, as the pilot successively cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">out eight of its ten powerful motors.

Isleport Number Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of a system of mid-ocean roadsteads, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">moored in the Atlantic wastes, and offering the mul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tifold advantages of hotel, country-club, ocean liner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and marine and airplane base. There were in all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">four such isleports, three on direct line be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween New York and the Azores, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the latter and London. Isleport</seg><seg type="columnLine">Number One, in the Gulf</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stream, was a popular week-</seg><seg type="columnLine">end resort for jaded Gotham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ites, and Number Four sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied a similar rendezvous for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">World's metropolis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ample transporta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion facilities were</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trans-Atlantic Air-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plane Service, Inc., which ran a daily line of planes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the crossing between the hemispheres, in ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximately the same time as that required by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth for a single revolution about its axis. Addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional passenger service was furnished between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metropolises and their nearest isleports by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">local planes, on a schedule adapted to meet the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quirements of the season.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Threading their passage to the outskirts of the assembly, the man led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way, with the directness of familiarity, to a ramp at the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing deck, down the ramp, and through a garden of semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropical luxuriance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The apartment which Holden and his traveling com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">panion now entered, comprised a wing of the upper</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">floor of the hotel. It had been designed and equipped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for his personal requirements, and offered a quiet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">retreat for rest and study, far removed from the dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tractions which, since the materialization of his chi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">merical fantasy, had made life ashore a burdensome</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">round of business and social engagements. Although</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">featured in magazine and newspaper articles, as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wizard who had united the hemispheres, there were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few indeed, who could boast of his personal acquaint-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ance; fewer still, of his friendship. He had entered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the lime-light of his brilliant career, a man of mystery,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and was rapidly becoming a recluse. But on the isle-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">port, he was a natural free man, unknown, save to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">manager, who was under strict orders to preserve</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">under all circumstances, the incognito of his illustrious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">guest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thus, it often happened, as on the present occa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sion, that Holden arrived on the isleport without even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the manager being aware of his presence. Occa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sionally, he was accompanied by one or two guests,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">college friends of former years, or men well known</seg><seg type="columnLine">152</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the annals of science; but, for the most part, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved to come alomj in order that he might be better</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to concentrate on some of the baffling problems</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever present to men of broad vision and mental re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">source.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The apartment provided, in addition to the library,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three sleeping rooms, a kitchenette and pantry, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was kept well stocked with provisions replaced every</seg><seg type="columnLine">week. Thus, he was enabled to slip quietly into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">privacy of home life, or if he preferred, he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">his meals supplied in his own apartment through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief Steward, or in the more public dininrt rooms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel. Life on the isleport, therefore, offered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest range of freedom, and the opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pursue any course of study or recreation to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt inclined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO account for the presence, on this occasion, of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">female traveling companion, it is necessary to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the more recent years of Holden's life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the time of the events herein set forth, he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in his early forties, possessing a well-built athletic</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure, despite his height. He moved with a freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">which just fell short of smoothness, because of a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain decisiveness and alertness which made his actions</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected, and, therefore, lacking in that finish</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commonly accorded to graceful movement. In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier career at college, he had taken an active part</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lighter forms of athletics, such as fencing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">track, and then, with the advent of war, had plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly into arduous indoor labours'over the draught-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing board and in the laboratory, with long hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most exacting mental drudgery and mathematical</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations, where a single slip might have meant the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss of many lives. And the war had exacted its</seg><seg type="columnLine">toll, even as it did over millions of those who never</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the fighting front. The close of the war left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him tired and worn, but the restlessness of the post</seg><seg type="columnLine">war period had seized him, and he did not pause or</seg><seg type="columnLine">relax. The vision of the floating isleports had firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">implanted itself in the fructifying soil of his mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his labours increased. Now with the materializa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the dream to which he had set himself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had carried on by sheer force of will, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come the warnings of a recalcitrant heart, occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional fainting spells, general lassitude, and physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">inability to keep the pace that his ever active mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded. Immediately he had placed himself under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the care of a specialist. The trouble had not become</seg><seg type="columnLine">organic and might, under proper care and treatment</seg><seg type="columnLine">over an extended period, entirely disappear. It was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, by the orders of his physician, one Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">,Von Sturm, that he had accepted the constant attend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of the trained nurse which the doctor procured</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him, and it was she, who accompanied him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his present sojourn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Von Sturm, a man of international reputation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the treatment of cardiac diseases, had realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the selection of a nurse for Bob Holden, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter requiring unusual consideration. He had studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden's eccentricities carefully and knew that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">selection must be a woman who would combine un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual proficiency in her profession, with qualities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind which would, whenever required, place her on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane of companionship with the scientist. She must</seg><seg type="columnLine">moreover be a lover of nature and outdoor life, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">something more than a dub at golf, the only game</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which Holden was allowed to participate. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching through his files, he came across the record</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one Kitty Cromwell, with copious notes on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">character, life, and the ability she had displayed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the handling of several cases. She had been used by</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on a number of occasions where linguistic attain-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ments had been an important factor, for the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a large foreign clientele. He sent for her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after an hour's conversation, presented to her the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails of the case. She was familiar with the news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper accounts of Holden and his floating isleports,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was at once interested in the prospect of a posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion which, in addition to its peculiar character, offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusually large lucrative inducements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitty Cromwell had been in Holden's employ only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few months, and this was her first trip to the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanted isles, about which she had read and heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much. The trip on the giant aircraft, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried them steadier than an ocean liner, and swifter</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a bird in flight, had been filled with excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">and interest, but upon their arrival in Holden's apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, she succumbed to the feeling of restful languor</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed a part of the place. Holden showed un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakable signs of fatigue, so she suppressed her de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire to explore the isleport--there would be days, pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly weeks, for that delightful occupation--and set</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself about the work of making the place comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her patient and herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The discovery of the well stocked larder coupled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the quiet homelike atmosphere of the surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, quickly led to the decision to prepare the eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning meal herself rather than requisition the services</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hotel chef, as Holden had suggested; and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon busily engaged in the arts which are rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">being relegated to the age of the unemancipated fe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">male.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The meal was soon served in the library, and seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">had Holden enjoyed a meal, at once so simple, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholesome. The long voyage through the early autumn</seg><seg type="columnLine">air had whetted their appetites, and they ate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that freedom of appreciation, which distinguishes keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">relish from aesthetic insouciance. As the last glow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the setting sun flooded the room, then quickly faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the short autumn twilight, Holden switched on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light, and sinking into his easy chair, lighted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe and picked up a late magazine. In a short time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Cromwell, too, sat down with a book she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected from the shelves and listlessly perused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages, but her mind drifted away on the currents and</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter-currents of life, that had shaped her course</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this haven of rest and peace. From far below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came to them the rythmic swish and rush of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rollers, breaking through the bridge-work of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure, and this constant repetition at regular inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals relaxed the tension of tired nerves, until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great outer world seemed to recede, leaving behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of isolation--a sense of being carried along on</seg><seg type="columnLine">some wave of destiny out into the great adventurous</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEITHER one felt under necessity to make conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation, for during the few months of their as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sociation, there had come about a mutual feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom from the constraint, which too often blights</seg><seg type="columnLine">companionship with the chit-chat of enforced conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. But Holden finally looked up from an article he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been reading on "Our European Relations," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to himself than to her, he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This European turmoil seems to grow apace. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling where it will end. If our country continues her</seg><seg type="columnLine">demand for payment of war loans, it may mean the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventual bankruptcy of many European countries. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">build a tariff wall around American industries to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep out European competition, and in so doing cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off one of their chief sources of revenue. They look</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us as a grasping creditor who, like Shylock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would extract the pound of flesh. A number of Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pean countries have banded themselves together in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">industrial boycott of all goods from the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">153</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">States. To add seriousness to the situation, immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">sums of money, which our country claims should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in payment of Europe's debts to us, are being</seg><seg type="columnLine">expended in the interests of European military pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paredness, and their development and production of</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplanes has grown beyond all measure of industrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity. All wars of the past have had their roots in</seg><seg type="columnLine">economic causes, and the present situation is, to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least, pregnant with alarming possibilities. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">still the United States sleeps, confident in her security</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the world's banker. The law often contributes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the making of thieves and murderers, and we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not loose sight of the fact that a successful blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck by our debtors would absolve them from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">present obligations and, at the same time, place our</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense wealth at their disposal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In case of trouble between Europe and the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States, what about these isleports?" she asked. "An</seg><seg type="columnLine">air fleet such as Europe could mobilize, could easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">seize them and make them a base for operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">against America."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Such an emergency has been provided for.

You may know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or perhaps you don't, that these isleports are floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">on long necked steel bottles. The bodies of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottles are deep down in the ocean, below the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">of surface disturbances. Waves affect the water under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface less and less as the depth is greater. At a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient depth there is no effect. This keeps the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isleports, to use a sailors' term, on even keel, and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vents their being tossed about on the waves like ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This isleport rests upon the necks of ten thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these steel bottles, and the lower deck is a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty feet above the bodies of the bottles. Inas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as the highest waves known in the Atlantic are</seg><seg type="columnLine">about forty feet high, no storm however violent, can</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturb the equilibrium of the decks.

Each bottle is partly filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea-water and above the water, with air under pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. The air is forced in by means of a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">large compressors. The bottle necks are connected on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower deck level into pipe lines running to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compressors. In these pipe lines, each of which con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nects a group of the bottles, are air valves, by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which the air can be let out. The air valves and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea-cocks are opened or closed by motors. To lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">the isleport, it is only necessary to open both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-valves and the sea-cocks. As the water enters the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottles through the sea-cocks, the air is forced out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the valves. It would take seven or eight hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sink this isleport, as it will float with only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">third of the bottles in use. To raise the isleport</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher out of the water, the sea-cocks are likewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened, but the air-valves are closed, and the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressors are used to pump more air into the bottles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcing the water out through the sea-cocks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how," she queried, "are the isleports held in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same location? The ocean must be very deep here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too deep to anchor them by any ordinary means. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, the size of the isleport is such that the pull on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchor would be almost certain to shift it.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is a matter," he replied, "which occasioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">some months of engineering work and presented great</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulties. It finally resulted, however, in anchoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">each isleport by means of three cables. Each of these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cables is approximately three times as long as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean is deep, and is of such size that alone it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstand the total pull of the isleport. The anchor</seg><seg type="columnLine">is shaped like a clamshell and lies on the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean in such a manner that the edge of the shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinks into the mud. The anchors are so positioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the cables attached to them converge on a centra/</seg><seg type="columnLine">point. Near to this center the cables rise from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean bed to a floating buoy, of a size sufficient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry the combined weight of the cables. This buoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">is attached by a short cable to the center of the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the isleport; the buoy prevents the weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cables from dragging down on the side of the isle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port and careening the structure, and also allows it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing in such a manner as to always bring the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">side to face the wind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why the long side?" she asked, "It would seem bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter to have the short side facing the wind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is due to certain requirements of our power</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment which I will show you later. Moreover, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel runs transversely across the isleport and presents</seg><seg type="columnLine">its longest side toward the ends of the isleport. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance from either side is, therefore, approximately</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal. The pull of the structure on the cables may</seg><seg type="columnLine">either be all on one cable, or may be distributed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">any two of them, depending on the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind. As the isleport pulls on these cables, they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted from the ocean bed in a curved line, but, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any case, there will be some miles of cable lying down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mud of the bottom. This makes the pull on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the anchor horizontal, and in order to shift it, several</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of cable would have to be pulled with it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," she hazarded, "wars do not come over night</seg><seg type="columnLine">and foreseeing such an event, the isleports might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">towed back to America and saved. The destruction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a wonderful work should be resorted to only as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an absolute necessity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE shook his head slowly as he said: "No, I fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there is no such assurance. The next war</seg><seg type="columnLine">will come practically unheralded. It is even possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that actual hostilities may precede any formal declar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation of intentions. Japan did not declare war against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russia--she struck first. Germany overrode all peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtures by starting her march through Belgium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, it would take months to tow such an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wieldly craft to our shores without injury. It took</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight weeks to anchor this one in its present position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though the flow of the Gulf Stream was in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor. No, war is war, and by its very nature, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a destroyer. But, much as I would hate to have them</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk, it would be far better than to have them fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hands of an enemy, who would use them as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of attacking our country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems incredible," she replied, "that nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">would again plunge the world into war. Will they</seg><seg type="columnLine">never learn that war is no solution of their problems,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is a test of might and not of right, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the long run, industrial and not military supremacy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the real indicator of a nation's might? Why must the</seg><seg type="columnLine">justness of a cause be forever dependent upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to kill?

She had had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of the real man that lay concealed beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and exact scientist, and the view was humanized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew her to him. She was deeply interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this new aspect of one whom the world denoted as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of mystery, and she knew now, that the world had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never known him. He was a scientist, but, beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all he was a man--one who would use his brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind for the betterment of humanity. The question</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to whether he might be working toward some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ends he had indicated, came half formed into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, but she gave it no utterance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The silence that had followed his last remarks was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken only by the low muffled swish-swish of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves breaking through the steel structure, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, when an outer door was opened in the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, a momentary strain of music floated up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the orchestra in the dancing hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Holden mused, talking in low tones as if half to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, his train of thought taking its cue partly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought he had last expressed, and partly from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of the waves in the ocean below. "Funny thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves--the hallmark of universal energy--always in</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion. That old Greek knew a thing or two when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">postulated motion as the essence of all being. Ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves, atmospheric waves, ether waves, even the atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">in steel vibrating rythmically. We humans with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">puny sense organs, catch a few of them and think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we know the universe. They impact upon our sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">organs and those coming at a rate of from thirty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten thousand per second, set up vibrations in the ear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We hear these and call the waves sound waves. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">they come at the rate of two hundred and fifty-six</seg><seg type="columnLine">per second, we name that sound "middle C" on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">musical scale. Down in the ocean the fish are equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an organ for interpreting wave velocities far be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low our range of hearing. What is their interpreta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion? Not sound, nor color, but something pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">%vhen it sends them in pursuit of food, and unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they are pursued. Probably if the fish thinks at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, he believes that he knows the world through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense impressions. Yet fish have no sense organs for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interpretation of atmospheric waves, and our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to receive and interpret ether waves is but</seg><seg type="columnLine">little in advance of that of the fish when one con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siders the immense range of wave velocities which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no sense organ to interpret. Thus, waves from</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten thousand to three hundred million millions per</seg><seg type="columnLine">second are all lost to us. From that point to seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred million millions is the range of heat and light</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves. Above that again, is the ultra violet range,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is beyond the reach of any of our sense organs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though we had a hundred times our five senses, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which mankind is usually accredited, we would still not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know our universe. Sir John Lubbock, that brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">student of ants, bees and wasps, demonstrated by more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a hundred tests, that ants see ultra-violet rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">which are beyond our range of vision. Back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">early ages of the human race, the range of color</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision was much more limited than it is at present.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was William E. Gladstone who, although a noted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">opponent of evolution, first broached the idea that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greeks of Homer's day did not see the higher colors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the spectrum such as green, blue, and violet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky for them, was steel gray, and they had no words</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their language for green or blue. Moreover, in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent years, certain races in the Phillipines have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found who have no perception for these higher colors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such colors being seen only as shades of gray, or in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black and white tones of a photograph. The race</seg><seg type="columnLine">has at least doubled its range of color vision during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the period of written history, and we may even look</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to the time when we shall have advanced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ant stage; but, in any case, there will always be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an infinite range of waves beyond our ken."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He reached to the table, touched a button, and slowly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turned a dial, and through the room there floated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">music from an orchestra in Boston. "Waves," he con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tinued, "just waves; harmonized in a hall in Boston,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then raised into the range between sound and sight,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where there is no sense organ that can interpret</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them. These shorter waves travel faster and farther,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and are finally transferred back into the range of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hearing by this receiver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The interpretation and control of ether waves, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key to Utopia, and we are standing on fhe thresh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold. Some day the door will be opened; some one will</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the key that will unlock it; and in that day, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">science that now is, will appear to us as the child who</seg><seg type="columnLine">builds his world from a sand pile and a few blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitty Cromwell knew that a prophet had spoken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet it all seemed so Simple, so easy to understand. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">sureness of himself and of the matters about which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he talked, carried conviction. They were not the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried hypotheses of a fanatical dreamer, but the simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts of scientific achievement reaching out its hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the future; a philosophy that would germinate</seg><seg type="columnLine">into scientific activity, and endow the world with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruits. Intuitively, she felt that the trend of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">present investigation and experiments, the work which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had come here to complete, was in an intricate way</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected with the two leading thoughts of his discus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion; war and ether waves.

But then there came the realization,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had no need for such poor help as she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer.

The discussion of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">important geographical differences, however, must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">left to those modern savants who, while differing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the details, have arrived at a fairly uniform con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensus of opinion respecting some of the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes involved. Thus, it is fairly well established</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in those remote times, before man had become an</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright animal, physically speaking, the continent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe extended westward to a line known as the At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantic Shelf, many miles to the West of the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast lines of Ireland and Spain. The British Isles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that time a part of continental Europe. The Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish Channel would have presented no such challenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the daring and endurance of swimmers as at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present day, for its bed was a beautiful valley through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Seine and the Thames flowed westward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean. The Mediterranean was a system of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">inland seas, separated by the isthmus, the northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of which is now known as Italy, which united the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern coast of Africa with the southern part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whence the Legend of Atlantis originated is un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, for legend is as old as language itself, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fair daughter, history, is a twin to the graphic</seg><seg type="columnLine">art. But long before the first crude ideographs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut on wood bark or chiselled in stone, the great con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinental changes that made Britain an island, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused the Mediterranean to flow westward through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pillars of Hercules into the Atlantic, had taken place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The human race was cradled in the East, but its</seg><seg type="columnLine">march wes ever, westward. Westward lay the unknown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to minds impregnated with the raw materials of</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination, the unknown was the land of golden op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity. As the centuries rolled on, this westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">migration fringed the shores of the Mediterranean</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spread North and South along the western coasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Europe; and it was but natural to this hardy race</seg><seg type="columnLine">of adventurers, that, as they gathered about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">campfires in cave and hut, the thought that the sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which beat upon their own rocky coasts, must likewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">wash the gravelly beach of an opposite shore, became</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject of their conversation and their dreams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Legend of Atlantis was first recorded by Plato,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had received it from certain Egyptian priests.</seg><seg type="columnLine">According to these priests, Atlantis was a continent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable size, many days' voyage to the West of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pillars of Hercules. Ten thousand years before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Christian Era, it had been a powerful kingdom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its armies had overrun the lands which bordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mediterranean. It is not surprising, therefore; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the minds of ancient mariners, the westward ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">cradled a Utopia which offered to them the fulfillment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their wildest dreams of adventure or avarice. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabled land offered all that the heart could desire, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">climate was warmed by favoring breezes and warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean currents; its rich vegetation supplied food in</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty without the necessity of cultivation; its waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowed in crystal clear streams which defied the rav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages of age and made sickness a thing unknown; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its inhabitants were adorned with pearls of a size and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opalescence exceeding any ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This idea like those of Paradise, Heaven, Nirvana,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the Elysian Fields, may have been nurtured by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire that has ever animated the mind of man with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the hope of perfection, here or hereafter. But, what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever its source, certain it is that the idea was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainspring of many voyages of discovery, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">may not be too certain that the adventurous spirits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Columbus and Vespucci were not more concentrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hope of discovery of the lost Atlantis, than by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more mercantile pursuit of a shorter passage to</seg><seg type="columnLine">India. Nor has this ancient conceit lost any of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">allurement before the modern advances of science, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever and anon this legendary lost continent becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly or indirectly, the object of oceanographic re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">search.

These great wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">or decks were covered with soil from one to four feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in depth, in which grew trees, shrubbery and flowers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over its undulating surface was a velvety carpet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of grass offering many enticing banks for repose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gravel walks wound in and out amidst the semi-tropi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal shrubbery, while canaries, mocking birds, parrots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">macaws, and a variety of bright plumaged birds flitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">about freely among the branches of the trees, content</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain in the unmolested security of this island</seg><seg type="columnLine">paradise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In nautical parlance, Isleport Number Two was sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uated in Lat. 38°-20', and Long. 51°-38' West; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in direct line between New York and the Azores,</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately twelve hundred miles from each. It was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, in the path of the North Atlantic Eddy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which takes its eastward movement from the current</seg><seg type="columnLine">friction of the Gulf Stream a hundred miles or so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the North of the isleport. Some four hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the South of it, was that mass of seaweed throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">out by the motion of the Eddy, known as the Sargasso</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sea. The location, therefore, was one calculated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggest the analogy with that land of ancient lore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed now to lie at the bottom of the ocean. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">this resemblance to its ancient prototype, carried a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper significance, for as the legend of the lost At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis provided for the ancients the allurement of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new destiny which led them to progress and discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery; so was this modern antitype destined to mark a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new stage in human progress, the beginning of a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">voyage of discovery in the furtherance of international</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace and concord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Guests arriving at the isleport by airplane, alighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a vast level field which constituted the upper land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing deck. From this deck, they were conducted down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long inclined ramp to the fourth deck, known as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palm Garden. Here they entered the hotel at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">156</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seventh floor and descended by elevator to the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, on which the offices were located. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">two floors of the hotel to each outer deck, and the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor was, therefore, on the same level as the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. In addition to the offices, the third floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel included the main dining room, theatre, music</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and a large open foyer which offered the facil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ities of a general assembly and lounging room, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave access to reading and writing rooms on the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">level. The fourth story was provided with an inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">court or mezzanine, which looked down into the foyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor below. Beneath the office floor on the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond level, were grill room, reading room, smoking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">game rooms; while the first floor contained a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathing pool, the tank being underslung beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level of the first deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The lower deck of the isleport, was used for en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineering purposes. It provided extensive machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">shops for the repair of planes and for general attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mechanical equipment of the isleport. On this</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, the hotel expanded into two lateral wings hous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the shops, pumps, compressors and generators</seg><seg type="columnLine">which furnished power, light and heat. Outside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these wings, were stored a number of lifeboats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seagoing motor launches, which were kept equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and provisioned at all times for emergency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The second deck provided a nine hole golf course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Number One Tee was located near to the front end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel and the fairway extended toward the far end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck but bore slightly inward. About fifty yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this tee, a ravine dipped down some twenty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the lower deck. The sides of this ravine were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dotted with outcropping rock ledges, and a drive from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first tee must needs be well over a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty yards in order to safely cross this hazard. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">course was covered with grass, while bushes, trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shrubbery were skillfully arranged to provide</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of rough ground. The supporting columns of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure offered many obstacles to the balls and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight driving essential. On the opposite end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isleport, beyond where the fifth fairway dog-legged</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the rear end of the hotel, an artificial lake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some eighty yards across, provided a water hazard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This lake was dotted with pond lilies and surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bushes and rough ground, and the approach to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifth green was directly across it. The links offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunkers, sand traps, and all the paraphernalia of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">golfer's paradise, laid out with such consummate skill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wealth of engineering and landscape gardening that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course carried the conviction of a natural stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of terra firma, with no suggestion that earth, trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lakes were sustained in mid-air by means of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel structure. The holes ranged from a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty to three hundred and fifty yards; not long holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the most part, but beset with difficulties far greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than those usually encountered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The space between decks was thirty feet on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">average, but, for structural purposes, this height was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not uniform. There were sections where it reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty feet in height, due to the fact that the decks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stepped up or down in order to provide for more</seg><seg type="columnLine">adequate bracing and bridging; and the layout of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course had been skillfully arranged to take ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of this variation in heigti't in such a manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to give greater room for the ordinary trajectory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the balls. At those sides where the fairways par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alleled the outer edges of the structure, a wall of wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">netting prevented the loss of balls in the ocean. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">light between the decks was excellent and uniform,</seg><seg type="columnLine">owing to the fact that on the ocean, light is reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the facets of the waves at every possible angle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It permeated between the decks giving light of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and power, yet without the blinding glare of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight. The effect would have been impossible any*</seg><seg type="columnLine">where except upon the ocean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The third deck was equipped with tennis courts, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">children's playground, and an outdoor gymnasium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here the guests could receive instruction in fencing, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">could play shuffleboard, or various other games in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they might wish to indulge. Around the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the isleport on this level, was a wide walk, cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering a distance of a mile and a half in the circuit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The various branches of athletics and recreation were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in charge of a corps of instructors, who looked after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the physical well-being of the guests, and gave special</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruction in any sports desired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The fourth deck was, as previously noted, the Palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garden, and in its presence, the renowned Hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gardens of Babylon must have been dimmed, if not</seg><seg type="columnLine">eclipsed, by the greater luxuriance of the semi-tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">verdure. In some subtle manner, the palm has become</seg><seg type="columnLine">the symbol of ease and luxury--of a life that may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived without effort. We associate its presence with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropical countries, where life runs smoothly along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">even tenor of its way, unmoved by the struggle for ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istences, which is accelerated in proportion to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigors of the climate. But, the presence of the palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">has contributed to the ease of this struggle, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than derived its associations from it, in those parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth to whose soil it is indigenous. In a gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral way, it might be said that, were all other vegeta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion destroyed, those countries which include the palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their flora, could obtain from its various species, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the necessities of life. Some eight hundred uses have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been catalogued for the Palmyra Palm found in India</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ceylon. From the fruit of the cocoanut and date</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms, may be obtained food, milk, butter and oil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sap produces jaggery, a kind of sugar, or it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be fermented to make wine and arrack; or again, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be made into soap, candles, or wax. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocoanut shell are made cups and bowls, while in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">localities, the spines from the leaves are used for arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spear tips. The wood is used for furniture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes a beautiful polish, and the leaves are used for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatch, rugs, writing paper and ropes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOWEVER, it was not with a view to any of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">specific uses, that the palm had been introduced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden, into the plans for his floating isleports, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather that they might bring from their native habitat</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of that peace and restfulness, which is man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ifested in the lives of those whose lot is cast within</seg><seg type="columnLine">their graceful shadows. The temperature of Atlantis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranging between 65° and 80° F., was well adapted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the growth of many of the more than a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">species of this family, and from these a score or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of varieties had been selected. There were heavy bodied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Acrocomias, with their ringed columns surmounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with crowns of feathery plumage, mingled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more slender stemmed Kentias,' some of the latter re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembling the rush-like bamboo. There were Seaforthias</seg><seg type="columnLine">from New South Wales, with buttressed bases and</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight columns rising fifteen or twenty feet in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and surmounted by flat, wide spreading tops. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were the Attaleas or Oil Palms, which produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">a finer grade of oil than the Cocoanut; the Howeas</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling the Kentias and used for thatch; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low Ornamental Date Palms. The Latanias or Bour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bon Palms with their fan-like leaves, were not so suit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able for the rough treatment of the Atlantic breezes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the pinnate leaved varieties. The taller genuses</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, of necessity, omitted on account of the limita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions imposed by the landing deck, though there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">some which towered from thirty to forty feet between</seg><seg type="columnLine">decks; and a few of greater height were planted near</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the edge of the Garden, with their bodies inclined</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">157</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">outward in such a manner as to pass outside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing deck, their tufted crowns rising high above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the isleport. All of the trees were braced to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure to secure them against the effect of wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be a mistake, however, to infer that palms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the only family of plant life which adorned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palm Garden. The walks were bordered with ferns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost infinite in their variety, while here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scattered a few of the delicate feathery mimosas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The structural columns, beams and braces were fes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tooned with running varieties of the palm, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bougainvillea vine whose large clusters of flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by their deep rose colored bracts, added a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinating touch of color to the green of the palms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout the Garden, the paths were widened in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheltered places to give room for small tables and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer chairs, and, on pleasant days, many guests</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wont to lunch here under the magic spell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustling leaves and the songs of the birds. Here also</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the artist to paint, the author to write, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">book-lover to read amid the twin charms of ocean and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest. In the center of a broad plaza fronting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel, a fountain played into a marble rimmed basin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from its overflow a running brook trickled in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding course throughout the length of the Garden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mjjv losing itself beneath overhanging shrubbery, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">coursing over rocks and beneath fantastic bridges;</seg><seg type="columnLine">while here and there it widened to form alabaster pools</seg><seg type="columnLine">which caught the reflection of the graceful lanceolate</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves as they swayed to and fro in the gentle breezes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sunrise and sunset from the Palm Garden was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight never to be forgotten; changeable through all</seg><seg type="columnLine">combinations of color and mutations of cloud and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist, the great luminary rose, sometimes scintillating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or again refulgent in the red robes of matutinal birth;</seg><seg type="columnLine">darting its horizontal rays through the leafy para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dise and turning each leaf to gold. Or setting in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank of brilliant cerise, flaunting its long streamers</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the heavens, then suddenly dropping from sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the horizon of troubled white-capped waves, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented a symphony of colors beyond power of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription. Then the afterglow, never twice alike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing from moment to moment and as it changed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinting the crests of the rollers with red, purple, mauve,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink or gold; the clouds above meanwhile assuming</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic shapes, their edges fringed with the colors</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected on the waves. To an observer standing among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palms and looking out through their arching grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness, the sight was calculated to inspire with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">romance of color the sentient artistry that lies deep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roots of every soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But one cannot linger too long amidst the beauties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this resort, without giving some consideration to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elaborate means that had been provided to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the various demands of such a haven far removed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordinary sources of power, which haye become an</seg><seg type="columnLine">integral part of our modern life. The meeting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these demands had been accomplished only through</seg><seg type="columnLine">feats of engineering that would have daunted a less</seg><seg type="columnLine">indefatigable worker than Bob Holden. The isleport</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed power for its compressors, pumps and gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ators for light and heat, and he had wrested it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind and wave. Beneath the lower deck was an elab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orate system of tubes running transversely across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure. These tubes caught the wind and, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled through the long passages, it revolved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbines which drove the generators and converted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the winds into electric energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A similar series of tubes beneath the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean, utilized the motion of the waves for the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose, while storage batteries took up the excess</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">energy and held it, in order that it might be utilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time of calm, in much the same manner as that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storage battery in an automobile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The water system of the isleport was threefold. Salt</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was pumped from deep down in the ocean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through filters and offered for use in the baths</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swimming pool. Rain water was collected by gut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters from the vast field of the upper landing deck, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">conducted through filters into large storage tanks which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were suspended in the bottle bridge work well down</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the surface to avoid the necessity of carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">their weight above the water. From these tanks the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was lifted by air pressure to laundry and bath</seg><seg type="columnLine">and also for use in the fountain and gardens. Drink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing water was supplied from the mainland by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a specially constructed tank boat, and was kept cold in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tank also submerged deep in the ocean. Arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were further provided for the distillation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water for drinking purposes, in case of necessity. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain was another reliance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE hotel extended transversely across the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the isleport, although its length was less by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some two hundred feet, than the width of the decks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The front end of the hotel was pointed like the bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a boat so that, with the isleport anchored to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buoy in the center of its long side, this bow-shaped end</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced the wind. This arrangement served to greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessen the wind resistance of the structure and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time, the power tubes extending transversely</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the structure beneath the lower deck, were held</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the position of greatest efficiency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eighth floor of the hotel at the front end, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended out over the fourth deck, leaving beneath it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad passage which connected the Palm Garden on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side of the hotel. This overhanging floor com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised the laboratories of Bob Holden, and beneath its</seg><seg type="columnLine">jutting eaves, was the outer door, through which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed when he entered with Miss Cromwell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night of their arrival. At the extreme outer end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this over-hanging structure, was a circular room</seg><seg type="columnLine">built of steel plate and containing no windows, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this room was surmounted by a semi-spherical dome</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the level of the landing deck, which gave to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appearance of an astronomical observatory. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer walls were covered with clematis and Bougain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">villea vines, which gave to it something of the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance'of a turreted castle and added much to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty of the Garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Travellers, who had stopped at the other isleports of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Trans-Atlantic Airplane Service, Inc., had noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Isleport Number Two alone possessed an observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, and among the guests, the subject provided the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground work for many queer surmises. Gradually, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular room had gathered about it an air of mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">enhanced by that type of romantic fiction which, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, serves the purpose of a mental gymnasium for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the otherwise masterful inactivity of the social gossip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One woman frequenter of the resort had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a cousin in Washington, that this room had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been provided by the United States Hydrographic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Office for the purposes of investigation, but had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been used owing to lajik of appropriations. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">was author of the report that it had been built by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">retired scientist who held large stock interests in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">company, but that he had died before the isleports</seg><seg type="columnLine">were formally opened, and that the room had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been used. Many other fantastic stories were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">circulation, but only a few of the more astute visitors</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted in linking the name of Bob Holden with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery. Inasmuch, however, as no one had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">known of Holden's visits to the isleport, this report like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others lacked verification.</seg><seg type="columnLine">158</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The financing of the enterprise had not been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult task that Holden had at first expected. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">early as May, 1927, Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the first non-stop flight from New York to Paris.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his report of this flight, Colonel Lindbergh had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out that any attempt at regular trans-Atlantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger service by airplane would require a system of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather observation stations and water stations along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the route. His daring single handed flight had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great impetus to the project for a regular passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">service. But it was universally admitted by aviators</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this would not be realized until a system of mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean roadsteads was established. Such a system</seg><seg type="columnLine">would solve the difficult problem of fuel carriage which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise, presented one of the greatest difficulties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, the cost of such a system would not be pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibitive. Some two or three of the existing trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantic steamship lines together represented a capital</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlay equal to that demanded by the entire isleport</seg><seg type="columnLine">system, and it was rightly reasoned that such a system,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the many advantages offered to the traveller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would soon exercise a virtual monopoly in the passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying business. Isleport Number One had first been</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed and operated for a season as a week-end</seg><seg type="columnLine">resort, and had effectually demonstrated the feasibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the enterprise. Within a few months after the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the system, every European steamship line had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been compelled to drop all first class classification and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower their rates in order to remain in business; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some lines had dropped the passenger service entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were handling freight only. The financial side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the venture was therefore a success from the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning. The second year had seen the service doubled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Stock Market had experienced many an anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, as a result of this enterprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The success of the venture, however, was dependent</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the man who had first conceived the plan. A less</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorough investigator must surely have overlooked some</seg><seg type="columnLine">important detail; a less indefatigable worker would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have succumbed early in its development, to the dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficulties to be surmounted. But Bob Holden never</seg><seg type="columnLine">faltered, never lost faith in the enterprise nor in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to make it a success. He had personally</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked all calculations and supervised all drawings;</seg><seg type="columnLine">had handled the purchase of materials, organized a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corps of marine engineers, draughtsmen and material</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspectors, and provided means for the testing of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the equipment before it was assembled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the structure. The isleports had been assembled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep waters of Hampton Roads, by means of specially</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed floating docks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The problem of towing the isleports to their various</seg><seg type="columnLine">destinations had been one of unimaginable difficulties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could not be moved through the waters at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">average rate exceeding two miles an hour. Storms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents had to be taken into consideration. No tow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing company was equipped for the extraordinary ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture and no marine insurance would underwrite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk. Six tugs had been constructed for the purpose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide of beam and equipped with high powered, low</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed Diesel engines. But the question of carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel for the long journey, was one which threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time, to prove the nemesis of the undertaking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally it was decided on Holden's suggestion, to tow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the isleports into the Gulf Stream, then to drift with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current to the point nearest their final destination,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus conserving fuel. Finally, they would be towed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from such a point to their final destination. Thus, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due to the extraordinary completeness of the plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every detail, and the provisions made to meet every</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency, that this greatest engineering feat of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">times was made possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Each isleport had finally been anchored in its prear-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ranged position without mishap, and tonight the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">builder of dreams slept peacefully on his own material-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ization: slept as Orion and the Pleiades and the Milky</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Way passed in succession over his head, and as the sun</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">arose and the smoke curled upward from the camp-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fires of Thibet and Afganistan, and from the chimneys</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Eastern, Middle and Western Europe: slept, as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sun shot its slanting rays through the Palm Garden</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Isleport Number Two, and rose higher and higher</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the sky; slept, until the rattle and roar of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">subways of New York carried their millions of cliff-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dwellers downtown into the maelstrom of business:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slept, while the news-boys on the corners loudly cried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from their extras, the headlines, which brought con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sternation to the Western World.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Robinson Crusoe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Holden retired on the night of his arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Isleport Number Two, he had decided upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days of absolute rest. After that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin certain experiments on the problem which had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some time, been engrossing all his attention and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest. Accordingly, he did not awake on the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning until the sun was nearing its zenith. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked from his window he noted that the palms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">casting short shadows in the Garden, and a noontime</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet pervaded the place. Slipping quickly into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bath, he whistled an aria from the opera that had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the air the previous night. He was cheerful and</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy as he heard Miss Cromwell moving about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">library, and caught the appetizing aroma of coffee</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming through the open transom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He emerged from his room, clad in a neat gray sport</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit, and was greeted cheerfully by Kitty Cromwell</seg><seg type="columnLine">who wore, however, a puzzled expression as she said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I tried for ten minutes to call up the Chief Steward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have breakfast sent up, but could get no answer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I have prepared a light breakfast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He crossed the room, picked up the receiver, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly worked the hook up and down. The telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">was apparently dead. "Must be a defective connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, he said, "but it's too late for breakfast in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel anyway and after we have finished, I'll attend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telephone and we can lunch there later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holden opened the long windows overlooking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palm Garden and they enjoyed their grapefruit, coffee</seg><seg type="columnLine">and toast, as the gentle but invigorating September</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze blew softly through the room. Occasionally, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chirrup of a bird mingled with the song of the surf</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break the noonday hush, and they spoke but seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielding themselves to the serenity with which nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">had enveloped the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Breakfast over, Holden arose and went out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage. At the far end was a door leading into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main hallway of the hotel. This was kept locked, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he produced a pass key and opened it, and was soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing before the elevator shaft. He pushed the but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton and waited, but there was no response--no sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moving cage nor flashing of the indicator bulbs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pushed the button again and again but with like</seg><seg type="columnLine">results, so he was finally compelled to walk down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">five flights to the office floor. At the fourth floor he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned aside and walked out onto the mezzanine where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could look down into the foyer below. Open books</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazines and newspapers lay scattered about on</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables and chairs, giving to the place a rather dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered appearance, but not a person was in sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">This absence of people puzzled him, until he reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was nearly time for the express plane from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe, and the people would naturally have gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">159</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">At the outer end of this overhanging structure, was a circular room built of steel plate and containing no windows, and this room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">surmounted by a semi-spherical dome above the level of the landing deck, which gave to it the appearance of an astronomical observatory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the landing deck. With the disabled telephone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the absence of elevator service on his mind, he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended the remaining flight to the offices. This laxity</seg><seg type="columnLine">in service demanded that a severe reprimand be given</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manager, unless some unforeseen circumstance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been instrumental in putting the electric service out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">commission. Arriving at the desk he found it also</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted, and with mingled feelings of consternation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and anger, he passed through the office to an inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opening into the private office of the manager.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The key was in the door and the door itself stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">ajar. He opened it to find the room vacant and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">large hotel safe open and empty. Overwhelmed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement, he returned to the outer office and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a more thorough examination. The hotel register had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been removed, but the room file contained cards for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a hundred and seventy guests. What could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have happened to have caused this sudden evacuation?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Could some roving Captain Kidd, with his band of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bold buccaneers, have visited the place for the purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of robbery? There was no evidence of combat or</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodshed, and surely no privateer would have burdened</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself with a human cargo of more than two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred. Robbery was dismissed from his mind as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible motive. Everything indicated an orderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave-taking. Then he suddenly remembered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither Miss Cromwell nor himself were registered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel. No one was even aware of their presence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whatever circumstances might have occurred de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manding the evacuation of the isleport, they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have been notified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked out upon the golf course, and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended the ramp far enough to get a view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower deck. The life-boats were lashed to their moor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and covered with tarpaulins. The motor launches</seg><seg type="columnLine">were likewise undisturbed. Reascending, he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the series of ramps constantly ascending until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on the landing deck. The isleport was unques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionably deserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob Holden was not the type of man to be easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">disconcerted, but the unusual situation presented by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this evacuatiop of the isleport confronted him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem which, aside from the question of its causes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was calculated to overthrow his plans for the furth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erance of an investigation of great importance, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been the object of this visit to bring to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletion. But, beyond this, there was also the possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility of damage to the isleport and its equipment:</seg><seg type="columnLine">then again there was the still greater problem of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">causes. Nothing short of some imminent peril, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peril which might involve their own safety, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear to account for such an unpremeditated move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, try as he would, he could think of nothing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient gravity to lead to such extreme measures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he slowly turned his footsteps back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment, he paused often by the way to review the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">various aspects of the incomprehensible situation, He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered whether the other isleports had been sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilarly vacated. Then his thoughts turned to Kitty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cromwell, and the strange turn of events that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to their being marooned here together. While it</seg><seg type="columnLine">160</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was true they were not shipwrecked, nor could the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isleport be called a desert island, save for the absence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of other human beings, yet, in the main, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">left in that situation, which from the dawn of litera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, has occupied the minds of writers of fiction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His thoughts finally led him to the decision to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">into communication with his office in New York and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though he should feel the necessity of himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining on the isleport, he would provide means</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As he opened the door to his library, he met Kitty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cromwell on the point of leaving in search of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had spent an anxious hour waiting for his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn, and was beginning to sense the occurrence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some unusual event or possibly an accident. His ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression as he crossed the room and beckoned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be seated, added an intangible air of mystery to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the growing enigma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Guess we are selected as the principals in a mod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern version of Crusoe," he said, "Our fairy island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save for our own presence, is suddenly and unac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countably deserted--not even a footprint to indicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of man Friday."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Deserted," she repeated, "but how,--last night, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you not see the crowd on the landing deck?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He nodded with an enigmatic smile as if almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubting the evidence of his own senses, as he replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, but all have disappeared in a single night. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">are gone. We alone are left."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She had arisen and stood before him now, unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to grasp the full meaning of what he had said. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a joke. You are trying to tease me. Some of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends are playing a joke on us--on you," she cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected. To all of which he shook his head and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew by his demeanor the truth of the thing he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated. "Something has occurred," he resumed, "to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause the sudden evacuation of the isleport and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence here not being known to the office, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally not notified. I am sorry to have been in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strumental in bringing about such a state of affairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I should have notified the office immediately upon our</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival, instead of following my usual course on coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE stepped swiftly across to the table and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dial of the radio, but no sound came from it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her action, however, brought back to him his previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision to get in touch with his office, and quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">arising from his chair, he took her by the arm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">led her out into the passage, down the stairs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the hotel to the radiotelegraph room. Find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the door unlocked, they entered and Holden seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the operator's chair. He adjusted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head-phones to his ears and rapidly turned switches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dials to see what might be on the air. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no response, and he was about to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key and call his office code signal, when there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint whistle which, in response to his tuning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly resolved itself into the dots and dashes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Continental Code. He sat quietly before the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strument for fifteen or twenty minutes, then as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals died, he opened the antennae switch and facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitty Cromwell, said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has come. The thing we talked about last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. The European Alliance consisting of eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations, has prepared to strike a crushing blow against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States. I could not get full particulars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The message was sent from London by the Interna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional Wireless News Association. It appears that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">council was held in Vienna yesterday and lasted far</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the night. England was invited to join the Alli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance but refused. She has now been offered along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">other European non-members, freedom from molesta-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion as a recompense for their neutrality. France has</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted and England will probably do likewise. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">Council of State is still in session and can hardly do</seg><seg type="columnLine">othenvise. United States diplomatic officials have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been handed their passports and have left the Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pean capitals for England. The United States Am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bassador to England has communicated with the Gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment at Washington, and all American ships and</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplanes have been warned either to make for America</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately or to intern in their nearest neutral port.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All Europe is aflame. A powerful fleet of airplanes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">naval vessels have already been concentrated for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack on America which is expected to be launched</seg><seg type="columnLine">without delay. All of our planes from here to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Azores must have returned early this morning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the inhabitants from all the isleports.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those in England will in all probability fly directly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">America. There would be six between the Azores</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the United States, and each one is capable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying a hundred and seventy-five passengers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Could you not send for one of your planes to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and take us back?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head as in doubt. "It will probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">be impossible. All planes will have been comman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deered by the government and none will be allowed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave. However, I will do my best to get you safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. Personally, I shall remain here as I have work</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do, and this turn of events may bring to me an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceptional opportunity." He reached for the send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing key but she stayed his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not a quitter," she said, "if you stay, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall I. If there is danger or risk in remaining,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no reason why I should not share in it. War</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not new to me, and there may be some ways in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I can also be of service."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He extended his hand and she placed hers in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to seal the compact. And in that simple act, a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">comradeship was born out of the subtle quality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emergency that confronted them, for to both there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come the intangible lure of this adventure beck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oning them onward. "It is yours to choose," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and, after all, there may be something in the raison</seg><seg type="columnLine">d'etre of things that has placed you here. I confess</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I should see you leave with regret, for I have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that before this is over, I shall need you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His expression of such a thought pleased her, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had sometimes felt keenly his unconscious assump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of self-sufficiency, and had inwardly resented it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For to the sex that has mothered the race, no attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the part of others may stir up as keen resentment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that which fails to acknowledge their individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">usefulness or necessity. But, in behalf of Holden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let it be noted, that his self-sufficient attitude was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated only to the scientific side of his nature. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">achievements had forced him to be self-reliant. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked in a field of his own creation and his reliance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on himself was therefore, not the result of egotism</seg><seg type="columnLine">but of necessity. For egotism is a state of mind which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is impossible to a man of vision, who must by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">very nature comprehend the immensity of the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which his own achievements, however outstanding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are at best insignificant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitty Cromwell had moreover, another reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">desiring to render appreciated service to Holden; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason that had been giving her many anxious moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">as her interest in and admiration for him increased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This anxiety was related to certain stipulations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Von Sturm. He had, among other things, asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her for frequent periodic reports on everything touch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Holden; his ideas, work, anything she could glean</seg><seg type="columnLine">from "conversation or observation." These had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">his exact words adroitly impressed upon her, and ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">161</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">companied by a wealth of medical discussion,--too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much discussion, she had felt at the time. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to over-emphasize the necessity, and had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">her with the feeling that she was but little less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spy on the man whom she had been commissioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to restore to health. But she knew that Dr. Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sturm's methods were unusual, and he had based</seg><seg type="columnLine">his demand upon the necessity of knowing his patient</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly, thereby the better to be enabled to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent him from detrimental occupations or excesses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The salary was liberal, almost too liberal, she thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To be sure, Holden was able to pay liberally, but why</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the doctor insisted on supplementing her salary</seg><seg type="columnLine">by additions from his own purse? Nurses however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were often called upon to do unusual things, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not expected to reason why. But, reason about it</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she would, there was always an intuitional feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unrest, when she thought of Dr. Von Sturm's re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quirements. However, she would use her own judg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment when it came to the reports, and now that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were under war conditions, she would not be expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to send any for some time at least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They had left the wireless room and walked to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, each busy with his own thoughts, out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palm Garden. Scanning the horizon, they could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">far to the North, a faint wisp of smoke from some</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean liner scurrying for America. The wind had</seg><seg type="columnLine">risen, and a heavy swell was breaking through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge work underneath. Suddenly there was a shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the isleport trembled as a higher roller broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the lower deck, which ordinarily was thirty or</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty feet above the sea level. Her face blanched as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she looked at him saying: "The sea-cocks; had you</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten them? You told about your instructions last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, and now the isleport is much lower."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Catching her by the hand he raced her down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ramps, down and down until they reached the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. But in their.haste, they had failed to properly</seg><seg type="columnLine">time their arrival, for just as they reached the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, they saw a giant roller with upcurved crest</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooping down upon them. It was too late to retreat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he threw an arm about her and hooked the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm around a post to which the ramp was attached;</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time, he swung her into such a position</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the force of the wave would be diminished by</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking over him first. On it came and while an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant before, it had seemed that it would arrive all</seg><seg type="columnLine">too soon, now the moments dragged as they awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impact. Tons of water swept over the deck. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore at his arm, but he held on and clasped her tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. The deluge passed. The waters (lowed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck, making little rivulets from the scuppers at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sides, but still he held her,--held her until she</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved slightly to free herself. At the time he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not account for the feeling that he was in an especial</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense her protector. He would have done the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">for anyone else, but would he have had the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of elation in shielding another? He released</seg><seg type="columnLine">her from the embrace in which he had held her, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">still clasped her tightly by the arm as they made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dash for the door of the compressor room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT is one of the doctrines of modern psychology, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interpretation of an idea, or the meaning at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached to any individual experience depends for each</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual, upon the associations which they have built</seg><seg type="columnLine">up during their past experiences. Two people there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, subjected to the same set of outward circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances, would exhibit very different reactions. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">perception of things therefore, never gives to us a true</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of the thing itself, but only of the thing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it appears to us in the light of previous experiences.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This fact might well lead us into the philosophical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">discussion of whether we really know anything from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the standpoint of its own essential being. But waiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the deeper discussion of such recondite matters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must nevertheless be admitted that the broader and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more varied our experiences have been with regard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to any given subject, the better are we fitted for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interpretation of new experiences of a similar nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Kitty Cromwell and Bob Holden entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compressor room and turned on the lights, the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">which met their eyes, was a complex which held for'</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of them widely variant meanings. What she be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">held was, in its general significance, merely a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of machinery. Her eyes wandered down the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of turbines and compressors, attracted here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there by the polished brass of the oiling system, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shining steel of the motors proper. The low hum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lighting generators, run by the wind turbines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been left in operation, was scarcely noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by her unpracticed ear. At the end of the room a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large control board covered with switches and polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock-like gauges, caught her eye and fascinated her</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination, while it baffled her uninitiated mind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">interpret the meaning and use of the individual items.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But for Holden, each separate piece of apparatus had</seg><seg type="columnLine">its definite purpose, and she could not but marvel at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coolness and assurance with which he set to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. His every move betokened the definiteness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exact knowledge; there was no indecision and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment was wasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_She had been unconscious of the low hiss of escap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing air, until he threw a switch which started a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of small motors; then as these gathered speed he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wheel which engaged the clutches operating the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">valves, and gradually the hissing sound died and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors automatically cut out. Turning to her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look of relief on his face, he said: "The air valves</seg><seg type="columnLine">are now closed and no more water can enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottles. The isleport is safe." Then leading her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the control board, he pointed out a series of electrically</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled depth gauges, which showed the height to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the water had risen in the bottles. "Normally,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "these gauges should show a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighty feet above the water level in the bottles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this level should never be less than a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty feet. The gauges now show a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty-three. Another hour and we would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was working again now, with the same assur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance and quick decisiveness, throwing switches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">levers, and passing rapidly from one machine to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. She heard the hum of starting motors, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rapidly increasing pulsations of the compressors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From time to time the structure trembled, as some</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher roller washed over the lower deck. But with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compressors all in action forcing air into the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tles against the tremendous weight of the isleport,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the structure was lifted little by little out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger zone of the waves. As they waited, Holden</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained to her the mysteries of the different types</seg><seg type="columnLine">of machines and taught her how to distinguish be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween compressor, turbine, motor and pump. Gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, under his tuition, the appearance of the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its equipment seemed to undergo a change, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came to her a more accurate understanding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its paraphernalia. After half an hour, he shut down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compressors and closed the sea-cocks. As they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped forth again upon the lower deck, the rollers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were running far beneath them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How foolish of me to forget," he said, "yet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order was issued many months ago at the suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Navy Department.

Her gaze drifted off across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rolling blue ocean. The world was about to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged into the horrors of war again, and she shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered as she reviewed some of the scenes of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">conflict. She had done a prodigious amount of war</seg><seg type="columnLine">work then, although but just in her teens, knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing about it when she began it; but she had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">it well. Now she knew the awfulness of it and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul recoiled at the contemplation of another reign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strife. It maddened men, made them hate because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an intangible something called patriotism, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred up a tangible atavistic lust to kill. Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world never learn that war meant inevitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss no matter what the fancied gain? She recalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden's words of the previous night; "A single man</seg><seg type="columnLine">may some day hold the fate of the world in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands--It would be fortunate for the world should</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a discovery come to one who would use it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">world peace."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she was startled and arose from her chair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A shadow seemed to have passed over her, and she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">that vague perturbing sense of being watched; but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">look as she might into every nook and shadow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garden, she could see nothing to arouse suspicion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She decided to wander about the isleport and finally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the apartment and rummaged about in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">closets until she unearthed a set of golf clubs,--then</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down to the links. The afternoon air was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorating and she became so engrossed in making</seg><seg type="columnLine">the round, that the sun was low down toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon before she bethought herself of the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties laid upon her to provide meals for Holden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself. Ascending hastily up the ramps, she crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Palm Garden where she had sat earlier in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon. She was again startled to note that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine which she had laid down back upwards upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a table, now lay in a chair some distance from where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had sat. She would question Holden at dinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find out whether he had been in the Palm Garden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but would do it adroitly so as not to alarm or worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. But the later events of the evening made such</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrogation unnecessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">Decoding a Discovery</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALTHOUGH a product of the modern age and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiTM believer in the economic independence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, Kitty Cromwell held to a few old-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashioned ideas, among which was the doctrine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">every woman should be able to prepare an appetizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wholesome meal. Often, her career as a nurse</seg><seg type="columnLine">had placed her in circumstances where such an art</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an asset of the greatest value. There were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">times when satiated by the monotony of food procured</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the vendors of table delicacies whether in hotel,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">restaurant, or in that mongrel of the species known as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a delicatessen store, she would seek in her apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rejuvenate the jaded appetites of herself and friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">with delicious concoctions of her own materialization.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The request of Bob Holden that afternoon had come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, as an inspiration to do her bit in the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gram he was endeavoring to carry out, rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an irksome duty, and she set to work upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening meal with a song in her heart and upon her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was dark when Holden returned from his work</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the laboratory and he smiled brightly as he beheld</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in a gaily colored apron, and was greeted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enticing aroma of chops, muffins and other delicacies</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear to the heart of a club habitu6. The atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of home life and reminded him of his boy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood days on a New England farm when his mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">had provided food, often frugal, but of a memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">that still lingered with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dinner was carried off with a spirit of good</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellowship, and the room rang with laughter as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">told amusing incidents of earlier days; especially when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he demonstrated how the boys at a certain college he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had attended, forced all freshmen to somersault their</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoons over their forks to land upright in their cups,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they were allowed coffee or tea. Neither one</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned the shadow of war hanging over them nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">the perils or hazards of their situation. Both knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the sword of Damocles hung above them but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were willing for a time to forget it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dinner over, Holden reached to the table and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tune in the radio, but the only sounds were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of whistles and spurts which recalled the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">bugbear. But suddenly, his experienced ear caught and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized certain signals, and reaching for pencil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper he began to record a series of dots and dashes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but whatever the purport of the message might be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was in code and he could make nothing of it. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it ceased, he pushed the paper aside and said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There will be nothing on the air tonight as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">government will have sealed all broadcasting stations</seg><seg type="columnLine">until arrangements have been completed for the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soring of all news. But let's go out to the radio tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph room. Perhaps we can pick up something</seg><seg type="columnLine">from England."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he was about to rise from the receiver, he sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly bent over and examined one of the dials on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was indicated the meter wave length. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny," he observed, "that wave length is the same as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we use throughout our isleport system, and the message</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't in our code. I didn't know that anyone else</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the same wave length."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They proceeded without delay to the radio room</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they had, earlier in the day, received news of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war. It was equipped with apparatus similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that found on most of the large ocean liners. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending equipment was of the continuous wave type</seg><seg type="columnLine">and utilized three one-half K. W. tubes in parallel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These tubes were not water cooled as in some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher powered land stations. The reception was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corded by means of a light flashed on a moving strip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of motion picture film, which when developed, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a permanent record. It was also provided with head</seg><seg type="columnLine">phones for tuning in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Holden seated himself at the instrument, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally engrossed with the matter of the wave length</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had noticed before leaving his apartment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Passing his hands over the apparatus, he suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered a cry of astonishment as he pointed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank of vacuum tubes. "Those tubes are warm,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one has been in here. That's what I was getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the receiver, a message sent from this room. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">163</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">are not alone on the isleport.

It would only add to his worries</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could do no good. She must not do anything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would interfere with the work he had in hand by</seg><seg type="columnLine">arousing any feelings of uneasiness concerning her</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety or welfare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holden sat down again and turned the dials seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">some message from the air, but he arose after about</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty minutes, during which time no signals had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. They went out leaving the door unlocked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had found it. It would be well not to arouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suspicions of the third party by any act that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might indicate that his presence there was known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Then too, he might desire to send other</seg><seg type="columnLine">messages which, should they be fortunate enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">intercept them, would give some further clue to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes. As they walked back to the apartment, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know that from a covert in the Palm Garden</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were being watched, but the watcher was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">he who had sent the message a half hour ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the library, Bob Holden analyzed the situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A wireless operator would not have been placed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the isleport and left there by mere chance. His pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence coupled with the sending of the code message,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated that he had been placed there for the carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out of a definite purpose. The nature of that pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose would be revealed when the message was decoded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden had acquired that expertness as a wireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator both with the Continental and with the older</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morse system of dots and dashes, which enabled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to recognize the individual characteristics of the sender</seg><seg type="columnLine">in much the same manner as a musician is enabled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize the playing of one noted artist from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of another. Thus, he knew intuitively when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiving the message, that the sender was an expert</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator, who was working under some nervous pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, as if in haste to finish. The dots and dashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come across rapidly, but he had been able to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terpret the letters and transcribe them with accuracy</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the paper which now lay on his table. But what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever the message might be, that which lay before him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a meaningless jargon of letters, not forming any</seg><seg type="columnLine">known words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE construction of code messages involves a multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude of systems devised for the purpose of insur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the secrecy of the message from all save the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whom it is sent and who is provided with the key</seg><seg type="columnLine">for its interpretation. Simplest of all the systems is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which merely substitutes one letter for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout, as for example; the use of "K" where "E"</seg><seg type="columnLine">is intended, or the use of "H" in place of "A"; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so on throughout the alphabet- But such a code may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be readily decoded by studying the numerical rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionship of the letters used, and no message of</seg><seg type="columnLine">valued secrecy would be sent in so simple a code.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of much greater complexity are the so-called inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediate code systems where a key word or phrase is</seg><seg type="columnLine">used as an intermediate between the code sent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the message intended to be communicated. Such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">intermediate may be the name of a city or a historical</seg><seg type="columnLine">character, a catch phrase or an entire story; anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">previously agreed upon between sender and receiver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In using such a system, each letter of the intermediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">or key word is added on the basis of its numerical</seg><seg type="columnLine">position in the alphabet, to the corresponding letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the code message, in order to obtain the decoded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">message. To illustrate, we may wish to say: "Meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in London tomorrow." And as a code intermediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will use the word, "Paris." The message would run</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Code message: WDMK -- TO -- HV -- CVXCWE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--	AYLWIYYV.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Key word: PARI SP AR ISPARI SPARISPA.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Decoded message: MEET ME IN LONDON TO-</seg><seg type="columnLine">MORROW.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The recipient of the code message merely applies</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word "Paris" as previously agreed upon, by adding</seg><seg type="columnLine">"P," the sixteenth letter of the alphabet, to "W," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-third letter, and the resulting letter is "M."</seg><seg type="columnLine">In like manner "A" the first letter, is added to "D,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the resulting letter is "E."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The work of decoding such a message when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intermediate key word is unknown, is often a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great difficulty. If the message however, is of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such length as to cause the key word to be repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great many times in succession the work of decoding</seg><seg type="columnLine">is greatly facilitated. In any case, the decoding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">intermediate code messages is a task not to be at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted except by an expert. The only message that</seg><seg type="columnLine">may successfully resist the decoding expert, is one</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherein the intermediate is a phrase, sentence or story</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as the message itself. In such a case the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termediate is not repeated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob Holden had, during his residence in Washing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton at the time of the World War, spent many eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nings with a classmate who was in the Signal Corps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whose duties involved the solution of many so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called unsolvable code systems which were offered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their inventors to the Government. They had often</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked together over these problems and had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">this form of mental gymnastics one which offered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broader and more varied field than was to be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any of the current forms of puzzles. The interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">once acquired, had been pursued at random intervals</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the succeeding years, and he had become quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">expert in the deciphering of difficult code systems.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The code used by the isleport system was of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention. He now took the code message which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tapped earlier in the evening, and, laying it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table before them, proceeded to explain to Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cromwell some of the more important principles in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved in decoding.

He now</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained to Kitty Cromwell, that their first step would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be to determine, if possible, the number of letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the key word.

If it should happen that the two first</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters in each of these two words were the same, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would naturally indicate that the corresponding letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the key word were repeated, and would give an</seg><seg type="columnLine">important clue to the number of letters in the key</seg><seg type="columnLine">word. These words as indicated in the code were</seg><seg type="columnLine">"IOKO" and "IOCS." They were forty letters apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the code message. This indicated, if his reasoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">should prove correct, that forty was some multiple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the number of letters in the key word. It was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course possible that the key was a phrase or sentence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or it might be a word of eight or possibly of ten let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters. After some consideration, they decided on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight letter word as the more probable. They began</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the first letter of the code and went through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing it off into groups of eight letters each,</seg><seg type="columnLine">using a small dot or period as indicated in the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">going message. This, if correct would serve to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">where any given letter of the key word was repeated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They next considered the two four letter words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"IOKO" and "IOCS," and then made a list of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pairs of four letter words they could think of, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two first letters were the same. From this list</seg><seg type="columnLine">they selected, as expressing the greatest degree of</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability, the words "will" and "with," and printed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in below the two code words. In order to test</seg><seg type="columnLine">the value of this solution, it was now necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">determine the corresponding letters of the key word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In each case, something must be added to "I" in order</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Code message: IOKO IOCS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Key word: NT NT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Decoded message: WILL WITH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If now two other key word letters could be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, when added to the two remaining letters in</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of the code words, would form the decoded words</seg><seg type="columnLine">"will" and "with," the solution could hardly be doubted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their first attempt proved a failure. They then re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versed the positions of "will" and "with," and the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult was as follows!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Code message IOKO IOCS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Key word: N T I S N T I S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Decoded message: WITH WILL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS result was highly gratifying and they now</seg><seg type="columnLine">applied themselves to the work with redoubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest. That they had found four letters of the key</seg><seg type="columnLine">word could hardly be doubted. Referring back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original code, they noted that both "IOKO" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"IOCS" corresponded to the last four letters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key word, if their assumption of an eight letter key</seg><seg type="columnLine">word was correct. Therefore, leaving the first four</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter spaces in each repetition of the key word, blank;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went through the message and inserted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"NTIS" of the key in each of the fifth, sixth, seventh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eighth key letter positions throughout the message.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From these key letters they next proceeded to fill in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the letters in the decoded message, that resulted from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the addition of the four key letters already obtained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">165</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This process supplied a decoded message consisting MTP</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blocks of four letters alternating with four blank NTI</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaces, which, when completed read:	ANY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PMZSQRKILMIS RTULSC</seg><seg type="columnLine">SATLANTISATL ANTISA</seg><seg type="columnLine">INTERFERENCE SHOULD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"----EN WO----G DAI----</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LABO----RY NU----WITH---</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--	M KEE----STRI----TCH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I----D UNA----WILL----- 0</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PRE----ANY I----FERE---</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--	HOUL----RGEN----ISE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">R----OR FO----NDRE --</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">---NES 0----DING----</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLEN----S AND---</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was now a simple matter to find the remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters of the key word from some of the words which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were partially decoded.

He had evidently tapped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">message at its very beginning. He had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time to hear the station signal, but in all probability</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a private one and would not be listed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">surmised that the message was sent to the mobiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion base and that, he now felt certain would be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Azores. This enemy had played into his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the European Alliance, he now knew, would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the isleport their base for operations against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States. They had placed this Ravnowickz here</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prepare for their coming. Then as he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the situation he suddenly laughed aloud, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion looked inquiringly at him as she said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You seem pleased over the prospect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This shows a model of Armstrong's seadrome, or floating island, outside the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN TISATLA NTISAT LANTI SATLAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">AM KEEPING STRICT WATCH ISLAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AEHQSSC IOCS ZIII SA VILUKBS</seg><seg type="columnLine">TISATLA NTIS ATL AN TISATLA</seg><seg type="columnLine">UNARMED WILL ACT TO PREVENT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I was thinking," he replied, "of what might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred had Ravnowickz been alone on the isleport</seg><seg type="columnLine">today with the sea-cocks open." Fate, or whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be the name of the cause of those striking coin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cidents which seem ever to cross and tangle the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses of mankind, would have served the spy a worthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">166</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">recompense, had it not been for the intervention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man, whose designs it was the business of Ravno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wickz to frustrate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The situation which now confronted them was, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say the least, hazardous. An enemy was on the isle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port and while Holden was too well balanced mentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have any fears as to the final outcome, he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">underestimate the sagacity or ingenuity of his enemy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor the power of the forces arrayed against him. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flection showed that such a commission would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">intrusted only to a man of unusual resources and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning, and that the spy would let nothing inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fere with the accomplishment of the ends for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been placed there. Holden felt certain, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, that the desire to know more of his own inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, would postpone any open attack on the part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the spy. He had signified in his message that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was watching Holden and that he would prevent any</seg><seg type="columnLine">interference with the designs of the European Alliance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the message also showed very clearly that the spy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was totally ignorant of the coup d'etat which Holden</seg><seg type="columnLine">was preparing. If the European Alliance thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in possession of any valuable secrets, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would wish to acquire them for their own use. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">first thought, therefore, must be to keep all knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his intentions from the enemy. Furthermore, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must provide against any emergency that might leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him incapacitated. He needed someone on whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could rely to act in any capacity under his directions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was left to him no choice. Kitty Cromwell</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been referred to in the message as "Nurse X."</seg><seg type="columnLine">What did the spy know of her? "X," in the language</seg><seg type="columnLine">of science, stood for the unknown and that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious interpretation of the message. He felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could trust her fully and if he were going to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust to her the secrets of the circular room and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow he was preparing to strike, he must for the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, provide for her protection. The spy might</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek to wrest from her the information he desired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had already retired, leaving him to his pipe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts, but he would talk with her on the morrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went out into the passage to assure himself that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doors were all securely fastened. It was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">past midnight, but he had no inclination for sleep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his mind, like that of most students, worked best</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the silence of night had shut out the diversions</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the sights and sounds of daytime introduced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only twenty-four hours ago war had been virtually</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared, but it seemed as if weeks had been crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the events of that single day, for time, like space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is measured by the succession of events which occupy</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. On the morrow he would make some final tests</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inspection of the apparatus which was housed</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the dome of the circular room. He had hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the opportunity to make these tests in the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the dome rolled aside, but the presence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spy would preclude that now. He had been working</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this apparatus for a number of years. Even dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the later years of the isleport venture, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been gradually absorbing his interest and taking more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more definite form. The present apparatus had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been installed only for the purpose of making more</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete tests on a more powerful scale than he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitherto been able to provide. Now had come the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to put it to tests that he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed of coming to so soon. He would have pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred another year in which to study and develop it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there could be no postponement now. Well, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jvould do his best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His thoughts wandered back through the years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">groping among the friendships of the past. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called that night at the Harvard Club, and the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed like a drama before his eyes. The pledge he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had made that night had been kept and soon he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">test its fruits. Where was Jerry Scott? He had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen him for the past three or four years. Jerry had</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant much to him in those days. He had bought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first large block of stock in the isleport venture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then had left for parts unknown,--a wandering spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Jerry's. How his adventure loving nature would</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingle to be here now. Letters had come from him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at long intervals, from China, India and the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seas, the last one from Africa, where he was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to depart for the interior on a hunting expedition for</seg><seg type="columnLine">big game. Some day, after this affair was over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace restored, he would bring Jerry here,--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, the one who had saved Jack Rutherford,--wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Jerry ever--if he ever;--but Holden had drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to sleep in his arm chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            Out of the Past</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JERRY SCOTT sat at a table in an unobstrusive cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of a night cafe in Budapest. He loved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful, vivacious city on the banks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danube, for it was here that he had come as a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to study art. The years had left but slight im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">print of their passage upon him. He still retained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-knit athletic figure of former days. His hair had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grayed a bit above the temples, but his eyes flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their old time clearness, and there was no flab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">biness of flesh on face or body, for Jerry had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived in a clean, wholesome manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was disappointed as he sat there, not discouraged</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor despondent, for these extreme moods were practi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally unknown to him. He had worked all day in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">studio on a picture, that through the years was seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his mind, and ever and anon sought to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression. At last he thought he had discovered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">model. The eyes were deep blue, the hair lustrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, but somehow the expression he sought was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and, try as he would, he could not coax it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">being. He had hoped to exhibit at a Paris Salon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming winter and he had hoped to make this his mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terpiece. But why continue the pursuit of a phantom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Honors had come to him without the seeking. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sufficient wealth to maintain himself in his happy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">go-lucky care-free existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the old restlessness had seized upon him again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He longed for adventure, excitement, even for hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships; for the battle of wits against man or nature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whole city and country was restless, in fact all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe seethed with an undercurrent of excitement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Groups of army officers filled the hotels and cafis</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were the center of interest to all eyes, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">strutted about with a suddenly elevated idea of self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance. There was an undisguised feeling of ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosity against America. American travelers were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer welcome. They were treated with haughty dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dain and in many cases openly insulted. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money they spent could no longer secure for them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary courtesies due to travelers, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly leaving for England or for home. But Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott was a cosmopolitan who spoke the language and</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopted the customs of the native born, so he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">about unobserved and unmolested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The co/d was of the order of an old time borkaz or</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine hall, with a door at either end. As he sat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the half shadows of his corner, he interested himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the occupants of the various tables. A stringed</seg><seg type="columnLine">orchestra on a raised dais played Czigany music.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gypsy music submits itself to no musical precepts. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is invented to speak for them. It fascinates while its</seg><seg type="columnLine">strident tones annoy. At times it was almost drowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the babble of conversation and laughter, but never</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">167</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">quite. A strolling band of Gypsies entered, their color-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful costumes adding picturesqueness to the kaleido-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopic scene. They began to play and dance. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the famous Csardas or Tavern Dance, loved by all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hungarians. A number of the occupants left their</seg><seg type="columnLine">places at the tables and joined in the weird fantastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements of the dance. It was intoxicating, fascinat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in its subtleties and palpitating with power. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">music steals over the senses and kindles memories and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yearnings, bitter and sweet. It scourges while it en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains and one longs for the peace and quietude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature, of the mountains and streams. The dancers</seg><seg type="columnLine">race and swing. Weird notes chase each other up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down over the strings. The music suddenly becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">rythmical and measured, then it mounts again in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion and the Csardas ends in a bursting crescendo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry Scott looked around the room. Not a few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the denizens of the place were wiping their eyes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene was a familiar one to him, yet it always accentu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated his unrest. Now he knew why he had come here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He really wanted the unrest. It was the Chord of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seventh in his nature, which he had never been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to resolve. That was the thing in Czigany music that</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to him. It was the expression of their own un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest; the thing that had made them wanderers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the evening slipped by, new groups entered while</seg><seg type="columnLine">others left, but generally the numbers in the room in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased. A group of army officers entered. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no vacant table but the attendants hastened to clear one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and none of the occupants objected. The army had sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly risen to a position which demanded respectful</seg><seg type="columnLine">deference as its right. The round table offered them</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a short distance from the place where Scott</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sitting, and as they took their chairs the clanking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scabbards added to the din and confusion. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their number was dressed in citizens' clothes and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently about to depart the city on some mission</seg><seg type="columnLine">of importance. Scott payed but slight attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group, who talked mostly in undertones, until there</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly came a loud scraping of chairs and jingle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">accoutrements, as they arose and with uplifted glasses</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank a toast to "Der Tag." He had heard that toast</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty years before in the Bier-Hallen of Germany and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fulfillment had been sealed in blood. It aroused him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and he listened to catch if possible, something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conversation as it drifted across the intervening</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound waves. The man in citizens' clothes sat with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back toward him and the conversation was carried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">in German. Words and phrases came to him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disjointed manner characteristic of words which must</seg><seg type="columnLine">find their way through gaps in the general conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion--the laughter, and the clinking of glasses. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he caught the words; "Uebersee Flugzeug</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verkehr"; then, "Irnel Zwei." That would be Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden's system and Isleport Number Two. Scott</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted his seat around the table in order to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a better view of the party and at the same time place</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in a deeper shadow. Another half hour passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he caught nothing further of importance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but noted much conversation carried on in low tones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The party evidently shared in some information which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did not intend should be revealed. Finally they</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose again to drink another toast, this time to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">success of their departing comrade. As the man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens' clothes turned from right to left to clink</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses with his compatriots, his side face was turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Jerry Scott's direction. He was a powerfully built</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of average height, with a slight stoop to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders which served to accentuate the unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of his arms, and his face bore a pointed black</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard, which continued up the side face around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the jaw. Scott was struck by a feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiarity. Where had he seen that face before? His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">artistic training had made him a keen observer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and he seldom forgot a face or figure. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">group now left the Caf6 and for a time Jerry Scott</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat there turning over in his mind the pages of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. Then suddenly he jumped to his feet and rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the place. Hailing a passing taxicab, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven rapidly to his hotel. He had barely time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch a night express train for Vienna.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arriving at Vienna, he watched the passengers dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarking from the train but saw no sign of black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard. The Austrian would probably go by way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cologne to Calais, thence by boat to London. Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott did not care to shadow his man. Instead he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make for London by the fastest route, taking airplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Vienna to Paris, then from Paris to London. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring him to the latter place late that after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon. The Austrian would probably be a day later in</seg><seg type="columnLine">arriving. Once in London, he would wait about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing field of the Trans-Atlantic Airplane Service,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inc., during such times-as planes were scheduled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave, until the man he was following put in an ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance. He had never seen any of the isleports of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden's system, but he had read much of them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the general features of the service between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">continents. He did not have to wait long; late on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon of the day following his own arrival, black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard was at the landing field, and they took the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane for Isleport Number Two, leaving London after</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark. There were more than a hundred passengers on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane, so that it was an easy matter for Scott to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain at a distance and yet keep a close watch on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarry. But through the night the Austrian slept and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott dozed in his comfortable reclining couch chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY arrived at Fayal in the Azores, early the fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing morning and seeing that the Austrian was</seg><seg type="columnLine">having his ticket punched for a stop-over, Scott did like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise. A number of the passengers were stopping over</seg><seg type="columnLine">on thelfsland and others were preparing to take their</seg><seg type="columnLine">places. They all disembarked for a time to stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, while the plane was being refurnished with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel and water, and examined by the mechanicians. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">general bustle and confusion enabled Jerry Scott to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep track of his man without appearing to do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The landing field was of necessity, outside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city on a tract of ground covering some hundred acres</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more and situated on a high plateau overlooking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the port. A road had been constructed from the landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">field down into the city of sufficient width and evenness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to admit of automotive traffic. Buses were waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrival of the plane and, seeing the Austrian turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bags over to the driver of one of these vehicles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry placed his own luggage in the care of the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately following. Seating himself beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chauffeur, he questioned him on the way to the port,</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding their destination, and found that all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buses had their terminal at the one principal hotel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leaving directions with the chauffeur for the disposal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his bags, he disembarked a short distance before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they arrived and strolled through the quaint Portuguese</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets, keeping his eyes meanwhile on the passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the first bus now unloading in front of the hotel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He watched the Austrian as he entered the building; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he soon reappeared and entered a waiting automobile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott summoned another and managed to convey to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portuguese driver that he wanted to follow at a rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonable distance. They wound through a maze of rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets and finally entered upon an apparently newly</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed roadway leading out of the city on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite side to that which they had entered. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">road had been cut through the rough volcanic rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">following more or less the devious courses of a series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ravines until it emerged on a high tableland, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">168</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike the one at the place where they had landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning on the opposite side of the city. As they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out on this plateau, the driver stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed unwilling to proceed any further. Jerry Scott</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nonplussed. The chauffeur spoke only a few words</seg><seg type="columnLine">in broken English and he could get no explanation from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Finally Jerry addressed him in French and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the Portuguese brightened as he broke into vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uble explanations. The plateau was Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. They would soon encounter the guard who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would question them, demand their passes, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">told that they did not have any, would probably put</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in prison. Of late they had become very strict.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What were they doing on the plateau? He knew not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only work, much work, leveling it like the floor of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance hall. They said it was to plant vineyards, but,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Diable, every one knew that it was not necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a vineyard be so smooth. Then there were many</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the city; men from all over Europe, strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">men with square shoulders. They wore no uniforms</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was easy to see that they walked like soldiers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No inducement that Scott could .offer would persuade</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to go further so he finally ordered him to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the hotel. At any rate, it would not do to risk the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of being himself detained while his quarry pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded on his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arriving again at the hotel he entered and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the register, but so far as he was able to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termine, there was no indication of the Austrian's sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature. He decided therefore, to delay his own regis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tration and await further developments. About noon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man for whom he waited appeared in company with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a group of four others, all younger men of distinctive</seg><seg type="columnLine">military bearing. As they stood conversing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lobby, they were joined by another older man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germanic appearance and wearing a close cropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustache. As he approached the group, the Austrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his hand and clicked his heels in the beginning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a military salute, but the gesture was cut short by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his companions intercepting his rising arm. A low</seg><seg type="columnLine">voiced admonition caused him to change the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of motion which ended in an awkward hand-shake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After talking for a few moments, the party went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elevator and ascended. Scott spent a weary day</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for their reappearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was late in the afternoon when they re-emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the elevator and went into the dining room to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. Scott followed them, mingling with a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of guests, and managed to secure a small table near</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the outer wall, a short distance from where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group were sitting. To avoid notice he seated himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his back toward them and as he ate, perused a</seg><seg type="columnLine">German newspaper, which he had picked up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lobby, but secretly he listened to every word of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation that he could catch. Turning over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages of the paper, his eye caught a news item ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">companied by a photograph which at first glance, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a decidedly familiar look. A closer inspection revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was a picture of the officer who had joined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group in the lobby. The picture showed an officer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">military uniform but the original was now in citizens'</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress. Scott read the item. It announced that Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">-, who was one of the leading aeronautical en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineers in the German Air Service had left for Lisbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to confer with the Portuguese Government relative to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the establishment of an extensive aeroplane service</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Lisbon and the Azores. The service was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">established for the purpose of rapid transportation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grapes and other fruits from the islands to the main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. Scott read the article over again carefully. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was evidently published to avoid suspicion should any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one recognize the Colonel en route. He was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">dubious of the truthfulness of the account in so far as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it related to the real business in hand. Something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly brewing. He recalled the military activities</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Hungary and the journey of the man whom he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed here and whose objective was, in all probabil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity, one of Bob Holden's isleports only twelve hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from the coast of America. Why should these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two now be in conference. He was certain that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newly constructed road over which he had ridden that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, led to a landing field for airplanes, and the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose of such extensive and secret preparations was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be found in peaceful agricultural pursuits, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">more warlike preparations against the United States.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could catch but little of the conversation and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing in what he did overhear that was out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordinary trend. After dinner they arose and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the lobby and Scott following, overheard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel say: "Then you will leave tonight. Let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear from you when you arrive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JERRY SCOTT knew that a plane leaving London</seg><seg type="columnLine">about noon was due to arrive at Fayal at ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">v clock that night and would leave an hour later ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riving at Isleport Number Two early the next morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. In order to avoid being noticed by the Austrian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the interval of waiting for the plane, he secured</seg><seg type="columnLine">his luggage and found a taxi which took him out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing field. There were offices and a waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">room on the field and the employees lived in a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel there. Scott sought and found the manager of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station. To him he presented his credentials as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">director of the company and they spent the hours until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrival of the plane in a conference upon the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. The manager was an ace of World War fame and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was greatly interested in what Scott told him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard rumors but knew very little of what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually taking place on the other side of the city, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and his men were confined very closely by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties at the landing field. It was finally decided be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them that he was to warn his men secretly, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be ready to leave at a moment's notice. A spare plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">was kept at the field for use in case of accident or</seg><seg type="columnLine">injury to one of the regular planes. This would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept fueled and conditioned for a quick getaway. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">insure the needed opportunity, they decided to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gates to the grounds closed except during the time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival and leaving of planes. In case of any trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">arising, he would be notified by wireless from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">company's headquarters in London or New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The arrival of the London plane was attended by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usual confusion of disembarking passengers. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buses arrived from the hotel, he noted with satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the presence of the man whom he was following.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many of the passengers were making a stop-over at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Azores and Scott found no difficulty in securing</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage. He selected a vacant chair in the rear end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great car and made himself comfortable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night. The car was equipped with sleeping chairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">which could be inclined backward at any angle de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sired and the smooth motion of the airplane was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducive to sleep, so the night passed without event.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They arrived at Isleport Number Two shortly after</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven o'clock on the morning of the day preceding</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Holden's arrival. Jerry Scott gave his bags to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">porter on the landing deck and followed the Austrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a distance. The latter was unencumbered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage, having evidently left it at Fayal. This in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicated to Jerry that he would not be on the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">register. Inasmuch as passengers often stopped over</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few hours between planes, little notice was paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to arrivals, who wandered about as they desired dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing intervals of the service. The Austrian evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the ground and wandered about in leisurely</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion, taking a circuitous route which eventually led</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">169,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">down the series of ramps to the lower deck. From a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secluded position, Scott watched him as he examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the life boats, and, when he thought himself unob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served, the Austrian peered underneath the tarpaulin</seg><seg type="columnLine">which covered one of the motor launches, and Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">rightly conjectured that it was his intention to stow</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself away in one of these launches. Having settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter of the headquarters of his quarry, Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott went to the office and registered, using an as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the remainder of that day and the succeed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one, he kept unobtrusive watch over the move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments of the Austrian. The latter kept aloof from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel offices and the more public places, remaining in</seg><seg type="columnLine">remote parts of the Palm Garden. He appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be leisurely waiting for the arrival of some person or</seg><seg type="columnLine">event. Only once did Scott see him enter the dining</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and that, just after the arrival of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At seven o'clock on the morning of the second day</seg><seg type="columnLine">after his arrival, Jerry Scott was called to the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone and told to pack his bags, leave them in the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside his room, and come immediately to the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Isleport was to be evacuated. Dressing quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slipped his largest bag into a closet and left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others as instructed. As he went out to take the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vator for the office floor, he found the hall alive with</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited people running to and fro, asking questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">which no one could answer, arranging baggage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying coats and bundles. Arriving at the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor the elevator opened upon a scene of greater con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion. A line was formed to the desk as the guests</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked out. The foyer was rapidly filling with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cited groups as each elevator from the upper stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposited its human load. Coffee and sandwiches were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being served in the dining room with everyone stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, while the hotel staff moved from group to group</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuring them that there was no immediate danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When a majority of the guests had gathered, the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ager called for silence and explained that the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agement had received a radiogram, telling them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">war against the United States was imminent, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orders were to evacuate the isleports. Three planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on their way, two having left Fayal in response</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a message from England; the third had been halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Isleport Number Three and would wait there for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrival of the other two, then would proceed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States, stopping for the passengers at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">isleport. Three other planes were returning from Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land on a non-stop flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a few minutes after eight the three planes ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived. They told how they had received the message</seg><seg type="columnLine">just in time to make their getaway while a mob was</seg><seg type="columnLine">storming at the locked gates. A few planes from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing field on the opposite side of Fayal had fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed them for a short distance, then had turned back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The embarkation began. Jerry Scott went through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd looking for the Austrian, but he was not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. He then slipped away in the confusion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">secreted himself in some dense shrubbery in the Palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garden, where he remained until long after the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane had vanished in the morning haze. As he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it swallowed up in the western mist he felt that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done a foolish thing. His love of adventure however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be denied. If, as he now felt certain, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Austrian had come to the isleport to prepare a base for</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations against America, he, Scott, would event-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually be made a prisoner. He could easily manage</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, to manufacture a story of Having inadvert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently been left behind. It would be a matter of greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty to keep out of sight of the spy, who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine himself alone on the isleport. Scott knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of the presence of Holden who had arrived the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">previous night. He would not now risk going below to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out what the Austrian was doing, so he remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden in a place whence he could command a view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ramp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was past noon, when he espied a figure slowly as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cending the ramp. As the figure came into full view,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although at some distance away, Scott was astounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to note first the absence of beard, then the growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">resemblance not to the Austrian, but to Bob Holden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was on the point of revealing himself, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught sight of the Austrian slipping around a far</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the hotel. Holden was under surveillance. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instant of pause occasioned by the sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spy, Scott did some rapid thinking. He knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of the Austrian boded no good to his friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in such a situation he reasoned that itTwere better</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to remain as a spy upon the spy. Controlling</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself by an almost superhuman effort, he dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into his place of concealment. Why had Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden not left with the planes that morning when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the isleport was evacuated? Knowing the scientist as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did, he conjectured that his remaining behind must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be related in a definite manner to the impending war.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At any rate, he would see to it that his friend had</seg><seg type="columnLine">every opportunity to carry on, unmolested. Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott smiled inwardly over the subtleties of the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and the smile ended in a tension of the jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles as the old fighting instinct reasserted itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was at the old game again, on scout duty, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his old time cunning swept over him making every</seg><seg type="columnLine">faculty alert. He loved the game with its lure of ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture and he would play it now as never before. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that his most arduous duties would be at night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he slipped through the thickets keeping always con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed, until he reached the hotel, where he went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his room and caught a few hours of sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE awoke as the light was fading in the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">autumn sky and it was dark by the time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged from the hotel. He descended to the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck where he secreted himslf a short distanc from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ramp and waited. In about half an hour he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">footsteps stealthily ascending the ramp from the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, and soon saw the broad shoulders of the Aus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trian ascending through the gloom. As the spy con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued his ascent to the deck above, Scott followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sound of the waves below served to drown his</seg><seg type="columnLine">footsteps, especially as his quarry was also moving.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arriving at the fourth deck, the spy moved along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the hotel and entered a door in one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings. Scott was considering whether or not he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow and run the risk of being discovered by the spy</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside, for he was uncertain whether the door opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a room or a hall, when a light appeared through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drawn blind of a nearby window. He passed around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two outer walls of the room and discovered a blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">not fully drawn, through which he could see into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior. It proved to be the radio-telegraph room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Austrian was seated at the table operating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key. He was sending a message, probably to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">with whom he had been in conference the day they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stopped at Fayal. Scott withdrew again into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows of the shrubbery. Soon the light was flicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and the spy emerged from the room and slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in the direction of the ramp. Jerry Scott re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained for a few minutes in his place of concealment</seg><seg type="columnLine">considering this new development. He knew nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of radio and must, therefore, remain unenlightened re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding any messages that the spy might send. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished for Bob Holden. Bob was an expert in every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing pertaining to radio and might be able to tap any</seg><seg type="columnLine">messages. Meditating over this, he wondered whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ought not to go immediately in search of Holden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">170</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment and enlist his aid. He was startled to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">two figures approaching from around the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel. He was too far distant to recognize them in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, but he knew by the general figure and car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage that one of them was Holden; the other,--could</seg><seg type="columnLine">it be a woman? Had Holden married during his ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sence? He could hardly believe it; the companion might</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all be a man. But he had no time to investigate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must follow the spy. Back on the lower deck, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reconnoitred the situation and as he approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor-launch rendezvous of the spy, noted a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamer of light through a crevice in the covering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He crept nearer and peered through a small opening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Austrian was rolling himself up in a blanket on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leather cushions of the launch. Two service re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volvers lay within easy reach. Then the lights were</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched off. His work for the night was over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scott considered whether it would not be best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter and bind his adversary while he slept, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unarmed and it would be impossible to enter the launch</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dark without making some noise. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of fear regarding such an unequal combat but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the whole, it was inadvisable to enter into situations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of extreme risk if he would protect Holden. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over he wished to know more of the purposes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spy and the designs of those who had placed him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the isleport. He therefore abandoned the idea for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some hours he prowled about the isleport steep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing himself in the glories of the moon imbued tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. A mocking bird woke the echoes in the Palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garden and as the flute-like notes floated from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">silvery throat and trilled off through the waving palms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night cast its enchantment over him. The chill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">early autumn was in the air and the moaning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakers formed a melodious fundamental for the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones of the winged songster. A steamer rug that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been left behind in the precipitate hegira of the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, caught his eye, and stretching himself in a steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er chair, he wrapped the rug about him and was soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in the fantastic fabric of his dreams; dreams not</seg><seg type="columnLine">of war and combat, but of laughing blue eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raven hair and of lips that lightly kissed his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, just as he awoke to find the first slanting rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the morning sun shining in his face. He arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily and slipped cautiously back to his room. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">he bathed and shaved and then descended to the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen in search of food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry Scott yearned to seek out the quarters of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend; to sit and talk with him in the old time good</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellowship. But when the yearning was strongest</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came to him the thought that the best service</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could render to Holden was by keeping relentless</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch over his adversary. The situation was excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional, for of the four persons on the isleport, he alone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew of the existence of the other three and he there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, held the position of vantage. Ordinarily, one does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not watch another of whose presence they know noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The spy would naturally be on the lookout only for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden and his companion, assuming that he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Holden had a companion. Scott would thus find</seg><seg type="columnLine">it an easier task to watch the spy if he kept himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated from Holden and his quarters. His alleg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iance to his friend and to the cause of which Holden</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the exemplar, called up within him an unwavering</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoicism, to which the granite of the New England</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills, the playground of his early youth, seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">contributed something of their essential nature. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, the pleasures which this lifelong friendship</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered would only be deferred for a short time; mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he must watch and wait, giving to Holden the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to carry on with the work which had led</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into this voluntary exile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in order to carry out his plan, Scott reasoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would first be necessary to locate Holden's quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters, then select a room for himsejf so positioned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have a clear view of the entrance to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend's rooms. Holden had, in the days of their former</seg><seg type="columnLine">association, often talked to him about equipping one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the isleports with laboratories and workshop for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">development of his various experiments, and Scott, dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the few days he had been there, had noted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular room and the overhanging wing, and had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded that this was the consummation of his friend's</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans. Holden's apartment would undoubtedly be closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected with these rooms and Scott had often noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door opening upon the area near the fountain. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at a loss, however, as to means for obtaining con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmation of this view until he thought of the prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability of procuring a room plan of the hotel from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. With this prospect in view he went to the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found the plan he sought. Each deck plan was en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed in a glass covered frame and with them was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown the two corresponding floors of the hotel. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plan of the fourth deck, he located the outer door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw the stairway leading up from it to the eighth</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and on the plan of this floor he noted the apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and laboratories which were marked ''PERMAN-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ENTLY RESERVED." He was certain now that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the location of Holden's quarters. He also noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door at the end of the apartment hallway, leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the hotel hall on the same level. Making his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way up through the hotel to this door, he found it</seg><seg type="columnLine">securely locked with a special type of lock, not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found on any of the other doors of the hotel. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the room which he had been occupying and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering up his belongings, transferred them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room he had selected for himself in a projecting wing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the seventh floor. This room was so situated that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it commanded a view of the approach to the outer door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Holden's apartment and he spent the remainder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day there reading and watching. But the best laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans "gang aft agley" for even as he watched, Kitty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cromwell was walking into the clutches of the spy</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the opposite end of the Palm Garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ravnowickz Shows His Hand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEIR second morning on the isleport found Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden and Kitty Cromwell early astir. At break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast he broached the subject of the spy. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought to allay any misgivings on her part by recalling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that inasmuch as their own visit to the isleport was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown, the presence of the spy was therefore, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended as a menace or threat to them personally. Yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued, it was always better to be prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any emergency and it was but the part of precaution</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they take all reasonable measures against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazards of the situation which confronted them. Cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the room he opened a small closet and took from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawer two revolvers, at the same time asking her if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she were familiar with the use of firearms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She replied that revolver practice had been required</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her while in hospital service during the World War,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that she had attained some proficiency in shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at a mark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is good," he replied and handing her one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revolvers, he continued, "I think it best for both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us to go armed. Do not leave the room at any time</seg><seg type="columnLine">without this. It would be foolish as well as hazardous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attempt to find our enemy in so vast a place as this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with so many opportunities for hiding. Besides, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be better not to arouse suspicion concerning our</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of his presence here. I shall feel much</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier, knowing that you will have a means of protec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion should an emergency arise. I shall be busy in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">171</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory all day, and cannot ask you to make your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self a prisoner here. But first, I will go down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switchboard and connect it so that a call from any</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the isleport will come to me direct. You will</seg><seg type="columnLine">also find in every hall of the hotel and at various sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions outside, an alarm bell and push button. By press-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one of these buttons an alarm will be sounded all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the isleport. They are used as a danger signal in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of fire or storm. Should you ring it, I can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station where the call was made and will hasten</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After he left, she busied herself for a time about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apartment. Finally she put on her coat and, plac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the revolver in her pocket, went out for a stroll</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the isleport. Instead of leaving by the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, however, she proceeded to the opposite end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall, through the door to which Holden had furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">her with a key, and into the hotel hallway, finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerging from the opposite side of the building out</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the fourth deck. So it happened that Jerry Scott,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had placed himself in a position to watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer door, missed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wind had risen and to the northwest a bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">of storm-clouds rose tier on tier, like distant hills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huge rollers were breaking into lines of feathery</seg><seg type="columnLine">foam at thUr crests. It was an exhilarating sight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see them coming on and on like the serried phalanxes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mighty army; to hear them break through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struts and braces beneath the structure, then watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as they regathered force and continuity beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite side of the isleport. Gradually the picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">transposed itself in her mind. The onrushing rollers</seg><seg type="columnLine">became the ranks of mighty armies seeking to engulf</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work of one man, but were broken into fragments</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the creation that his hand and brain had wrought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was the picture prophetic of the results about to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">consummated when the mighty Armada now gathering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be hurled against them? Looked at with eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had witnessed the devastating effects of war and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the destruction which involved victor and vanquished</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike, it seemed hopelessly incredible. A few days</seg><seg type="columnLine">would see this marvel of the age either sunk to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the ocean or, worse still, occupied by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing hordes of Central and Eastern Europe. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">abhorred war and would willingly lay down her life</seg><seg type="columnLine">that others might live in peace. But against all rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, all the experience of the past, she had faith in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ability of this man, even though he defied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe. She knew that whatever he had planned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, would not be done by any of the known agents</seg><seg type="columnLine">of destruction, and that it must be accomplished be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the enemy was near enough to retaliate. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell or torpedo would wreck the thinly armored ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servatory or the unarmored isleport.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As these thoughts were passing through her mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she continued her stroll along the gravelly walks, paus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing now and then to gaze off across the ocean, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had reached the farther end of the Garden. Stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for a moment beside a thicket of shrubbery, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms were suddenly seized from behind and pinioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her sides, and she was forcibly propelled into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secluded spot. The admonition spoken into her ear from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, not to scream or make any noise, was unneces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary, for she inwardly knew that her assailant would</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek to gain information from her, rather than to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flict upon her any bodily harm. She gripped the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver in her coat pocket and it gave her a feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">assurance. Her senses were keenly alert as they stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a sheltering fringe of bushes and the spy faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">her about. He wore no mask other than the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard that covered his chin and extended well up over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side face. He was about five feet ten inches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, heavy shouldered and muscular. There was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">something about his face and build that gave rise in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mind to a feeling of familiarity, a vague sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">having seen him somewhere before, but there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to consider this for he was speaking to her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she must be alert to win in the game of wits that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know' me not," he said half questioningly, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I too am working with Herr Doctor Von Sturm." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed his s's. "He wish that you give me information</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning Herr Holden." She noted that all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentences ended with a rising inflection as if half in</seg><seg type="columnLine">question; also that he enunciated with a certain pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision indicative of one who has acquired a language</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the passing of the early and more acquisitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. A wave of disgust swept over her at the insinu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation that he considered her a partner in spying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden. She made no reply for a moment. His insin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uation must be overlooked even though she appear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in league with him, in order to protect her friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he said, "I wait your answer. What does he</seg><seg type="columnLine">do in there?" He pointed to the observatory. "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to report," she replied. "I have been here only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day and have never been inside of his workshop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only a day," he queried, "and why did you remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">here when the others all leave?" She told him briefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of how they had been inadvertently left behind. "Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">you knew not of the war? He knows now. Is it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so? And why has he not sent a message for tin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flugzeug ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did not know whether he intended to trap her</seg><seg type="columnLine">into answering in German, or whether it was a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip into his own tongue, but she lied bravely. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wirelessed for one but all planes are commandeered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and none are allowed to leave."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This seemed to satisfy him. Then suddenly he said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I must get into his laboratory, the observatory. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would see what he does in there. You must help me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will get his key and make an impression of it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealing wax for me." She shook her head slowly, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the thought that she must appear to acquiesce in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wishes. Such a course would at least gain for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them some time. "That will be very hard to do," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "but I will try."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face hardened and he clutched her arm until she</seg><seg type="columnLine">winced with the pain and he almost hissed as he said;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No double dealing with me. I know all about you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herr Doctor help you when you needed help. We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand for nothing but loyalty and service. You get me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that key or an impression of it, today if possible,--cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly not later than tomorrow morning. Leave it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that table where you sometimes sit across from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountain on the other side of the hotel. That is nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your door. Remember if you double-cross me neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you will leave this place alive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He disappeared into the underbrush as silently as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had come. Kitty Cromwell continued her walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the Garden reviewing in her mind her recent</seg><seg type="columnLine">interview. Where had she seen him before? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper face had a haunting, unpleasant familiarity. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had probably been at Dr. Von Sturm's where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come in contact with many of his friends and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clients. The Doctor's purpose in placing her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden was now apparent. Von Sturm was undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly an emissary of some of the Central European</seg><seg type="columnLine">States and had been supplying them with information</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparatory to the war for some time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE double role in which he had placed her, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">censed her. She was a spy; the thought was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volting. But in this capacity she was in a better posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to serve Holden by unmasking the intentions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy. She would use the Doctor's own methods</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him; would use them for the man she admired</seg><seg type="columnLine">172</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">above all men. She had not comprehended any deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings respecting him. Hers was the homage offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an ideal. Holden appealed to her in all the es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentials which represented to her mind the attributes</seg><seg type="columnLine">most to be desired in an ideal companion. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached that stage in life and experience which rates</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental attainments as paramount to all others. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">coterie whom the social set denominated as thinkers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pseudo-philosophic clique, who manufactured a</seg><seg type="columnLine">philosophy to suit the demands of their own existence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who centered their system in the relations of the sexes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and used biology and psychology as a cloak for liber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinism--for them the emotions stood in place of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. Kitty Cromwell had thought too deeply about</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters of the heart, the emotions, about life itself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to treat such matters superficially. Not that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopted the sophisticated pose, for she realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophistication in its modern sense had become more</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pose than designation for a true lover of knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the term originally implied. But experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taught her that premature advances in the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">of friendship usually presaged an unwarranted pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocity in the manifestations of what passed for affec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. It was not that she felt in any sense bound by</seg><seg type="columnLine">conventions, for none foresaw more clearly than she</seg><seg type="columnLine">that conventions are short cuts, rules of thumb, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guidance of non-thinking humans. They existed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the purpose of making thought unnecessary. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">she also saw clearly that the abrogation of conven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions does not and never can establish the intellectual</seg><seg type="columnLine">soundness of unconventional acts. She disliked con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventions because they were unthinking and therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">superficial, but she avoided the equally stereotyped</seg><seg type="columnLine">anomalism of the social iconoclast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holden's friendship had therefore appealed to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">as something real. His philosophy transcended the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lations of sex and found its roots in the broader</seg><seg type="columnLine">human relations. To neither of them had there ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred the slightest question as to the status of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">association on the isleport, for their relations had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always been on the impersonal plane. His treatment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her was tinged with an inbred consideration ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corded to the sex of which his mother would ever re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main the prototype; an old-fashioned dogma, if one</seg><seg type="columnLine">should choose so to call it, yet one which expresses</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sentiment whose passing may be viewed with regret.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever therefore, had been her attitude when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted the commission which had placed her in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">present situation, the constant association with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, the insight into his thoughts and motives which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been revealed to her, and the conspicuous bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his purposes on the present international imbroglio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all conspired to win her whole hearted allegiance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and to the cause he sponsored.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Returning in her thoughts to the matter of the key</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded by Ravnowickz, she could easily procure a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated looking key from several she had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed in a desk drawer, take an impression of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leave it in the morning on the table indicated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spy. He would not ascertain the deception until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following night and by that time anything might</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen. If it became necessary, she would go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden and tell him all, then remain with him until</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She reentered the apartment by the same route that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had taken in leaving earlier in the morning. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now almost noon so she set about preparing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunch, which she decided she would take on a tray to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden in the laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER leaving Kitty Cromwell in the apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning, Holden went directly to the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone switchboard, and made the connection which he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had indicated in their conversation. He then went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the laboratory and proceeded with the work he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned. His workshop comprised two large rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">situated on opposite sides of a hallway which con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected at one end with the hall of his apartment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the other with the circular room called the ob</seg><seg type="columnLine">servatory. Of the two opposite rooms opening on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this hallway, one was his laboratory and the other his</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument and machine workshop. The observatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a large room also, but did not convey the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of spaciousness on account of the amount of equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment installed in it. In the center of this room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pedestal on which an instrument, resembling in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">general appearance a sawed-off telescope, was mounted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This instrument was raised well into the semi-spherical</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome above the level of the landing deck, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by an operating platform situated at such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a height that a man standing on the platform would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have his head and shoulders raised above the level of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The instrument which bore a superficial resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blance to a telescope, comprised a barrel devise of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">two feet in diameter and about ten feet in length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was pivoted in such a manner as to allow it to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned in any direction or depressed to any angle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclination that might be desired within the limits</seg><seg type="columnLine">imposed by the circular steel wall of the room. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube was equipped with a series of metallic disks made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a new metallic element whose discovery was credited</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Holden. This metal was known as glorium because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of certain reactions to the cathode ray. Connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the glorium disks was a series of high tension</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric apparatus with complicated wiring. On one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the room was a bank of twenty vacuum tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">some four feet in height. These tubes recalled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their general appearance, the large vacuum tubes of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high powered radio transmitting equipment, but dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered from these in the essentials of their inner con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction. It was the function of these tubes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmute the current furnished them into that form</seg><seg type="columnLine">required for use in connection with the glorium disks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and these in turn when actuated by that particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of electric discharge, produced the peculiar phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenon that Holden intended using against the forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the European Alliance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although originally installed only for test purposes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no inadequacy in power or in the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure of the equipment.

As this mass whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">through interstellar space, it slowly cooled and as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooled it contracted, so that to these other powers was</seg><seg type="columnLine">added the power of compression. Each minute particle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas carried an electric charge, and these charged particles</seg><seg type="columnLine">called electrons became associated together under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great pressure of the cooling mass and formed the atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we now designate as the chemical elements. Thus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it happened that an atom containing one single electron</seg><seg type="columnLine">became an atom of hydrogen, while an atom containing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety-two electrons was an atom of uranium, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms of gold, iron, nitrogen or lead contained various</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers of electrons between these two figures. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom of matter therefore contains a definite number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrons plus a large amount of the thermal, electral</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mechanical forces which endowed the original gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eous mass.

But each</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom has a positively charged nucleus which acts like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun in our solar system, and around it the plane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary electrons revolve.

The electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">charges in an atom are therefore neutralized and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their opposite charges hold the atom together. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one case of an unbalanced atom known to science,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is the radium atom, and it is in a continual</seg><seg type="columnLine">process of decomposition, breaking down with little</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosions which throw off some of its original char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acteristics.

The production of such a posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive ray became possible with the discovery of glorium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a substance whose atomic weight shows that it con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains ninety-three electrons to each atom, and there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, a larger nucleus carrying a greater positive elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tric charge than any other atom known.

As the atoms disrupt, their nuclei shoot out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the path of a new type of ray. This ray has</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shortest wave length known.

Soon the mantle of night would be cast over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waters and he loved night time with its tranquil</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit of mystery. He was never lonesome at night</seg><seg type="columnLine">for when alone he philosophized, and philosophy eval-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uates life, interprets the unknown, and imparts an</seg><seg type="columnLine">orderly sequence to actions. To think alone at night</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to think clearly, and to think clearly is a gift en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyed by very few. To one who stands thus solitary</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the altar of nature, removed from the petti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of human intrigue and the subtleties of ambition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there comes a readjustment of perspective, born of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the immensity of that macrocosm in which our micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cosm moves. For such an one, philosophy leads to</seg><seg type="columnLine">paths of simplicity, unselfishness and wisdom. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had so transpired that this alchemy of thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instilled into his soul during his nocturnal rambles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had served to temper the turbulence and impetuosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Jerry Scott's devil-may-care disposition, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmuted a predestined vagrant into a character</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose unassuming simplicity and directness had won</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him both homage and love from all who knew him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the mellowing effect of years and the fruits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">philosophical thinking, had not carried in their train</seg><seg type="columnLine">any relaxation of that masculine virility, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever ready to maintain the freedom of his indomit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able spirit. To him the cause of a friend was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own cause and he knew full well that sooner or later</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be his privilege to match himself against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Austrian in Holden's behalf. How or when such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">contest might arise, he knew not and cared not.

He did not intend to force any</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue with the spy, but he knew that the Austrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not delay much longer to strike his blow at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was dark as he stepped through the* outer door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hotel into the Palm Garden, and he paused for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few moments to give his eyes time to adjust them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves to the night. He wore a dark colored sweater</seg><seg type="columnLine">in lieu of a coat, in order to give himself greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom of action and at the same time make him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self more invisible. Groping his way along the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, h? reached the ramp and descended two decks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the golf course. He could see more clearly now but</seg><seg type="columnLine">still only for a few yards ahead. His first objective</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be to locate the Austrian, then keep strict watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his movements. There was little trouble to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected from him by day, but by night he must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">on guard, especially as the time for the Allied blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It will be remembered that Number One Tee of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, was located near to the front end of the hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the fairway crossed a ravine about fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards from this tee. The ramp coming up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower deck was situated on the opposite side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel from this tee. Coming down from the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, Scott made a circuit of the hotel in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assure himself that the spy had not yet ascended</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as he rounded the bow-like front of the struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, he crashed forcibly into the heavy set frame of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man he sought.

Before his assailant's arm had even</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to straighten out in order to bring his pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">into firing position, Scott sprang at him and grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spy's right wrist in his left hand. At the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant his right hand shot out with terrific force,</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm outward, in such a manner that his palm caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of the Austrian's pistol hand, bending it vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently inward at the wrist which Scott held with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp of iron. This sudden inward flexing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spy's hand automatically released his grip on the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver which dropped from his inert fingers. Even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it fell toward the deck, a lucky kick of Scott's right</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot caught it and propelled it through the air into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distant bunch of shrubbery. The infuriated Austrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to grapple with him but Scott sprang backwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the reach of those powerful arms, sensing full</seg><seg type="columnLine">well the strength of his assailant, and they faced each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other again on more equal terms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spy was a powerful man, heavily muscled through</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, shoulders and arms.

In the coming com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bat he would depend on his strength; brains meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to him, especially when, as in the present in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, he was enraged.

Moreover Scott was controlled by his brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than by his emotions, and he would proceed</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligently to seek out his enemy's weaknesses. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack would overwhelm by its surprises; it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">varied from moment to moment and each variation</seg><seg type="columnLine">would inflict some new source of pain on the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his antagonist. Finally, Jerry Scott was a prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tised and proficient boxer who would waste none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stpingth, but would make every blow count in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the struggle for ultimate victory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the Austrian rushed in like an enraged Ber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serker, to grapple with his antagonist, Scott lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">eide-stepped with the movement of a skillful boxer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sent a smashing right to the jaw of his antag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onist; but the blow seemed only to anger his assailant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who paused only for an instant and came at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again swinging his long sledge hammer arms wildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">like flails. To the boxer who has learned to lead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter with a skillful opponent along the definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines laid down for the art of self-defense, nothing is</seg><seg type="columnLine">more disconcerting than the untrained movements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an antagonist who, utterly oblivious to the science of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow and parry, uses his arms as clubs to beat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guard of his more scientific adversary with a total</seg><seg type="columnLine">disregard of purpose or direction. Many a profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional fighter's hopes have been wrecked in this man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner by an unscientific but more rugged opponent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott knew full well that such a course would rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaust the spy, and if he could only evade those</seg><seg type="columnLine">club-like blows, inflicting meanwhile sufficient punish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to keep the spy enraged, victory would ultimately</seg><seg type="columnLine">be his. The light was becoming stronger as the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">neared its rising and the possibility of an accidental</seg><seg type="columnLine">misstep would soon be removed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AGAIN and again, the Austrian rushed at him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those wildly flailing arms and, as often as he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, Scott side-stepped to right or left just in the nick</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time, staggering his opponent as he did so, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hard jabs to the head. Time and again, he caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spy on a certain spot on the jaw, which, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to believe, would most quickly and effectually</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtail his opponent's power of resistance. Once, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he side-stepped, a powerful swing of his opponent's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist struck and glanced off his left shoulder whisking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him slightly off balance. The Austrian, seeing his ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage, unexpectedly made a dive to catch him round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the legs. Scott jumped back a fraction too late, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both went down rolling over and over on the grassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairway, but Jerry Scott was the quicker and managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kick himself free from his opponent's uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp. Both were panting as they came to their feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, for the pace had been terrific and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no gong to sound a rest period. Scott however, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">husbanded his strength and his superior strategem</seg><seg type="columnLine">now began to tell in his favor. The moment for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he waited had now arrived and he took the offensive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without giving his opponent a chance to catch his</seg><seg type="columnLine">second wind, he rushed in and with the skill of long</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice, uppercut through the Austrian's guard, land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a terrific blow on the point of the chin. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">timing and placement were perfect and he noted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his enemy's knees sagged, but only for an instant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His opponent showed a surprising ability to take all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the punishment Scott could give, but he knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end was approaching. He had learned through past</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience never to exert himself beyond a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit; always to have something in reserve for a final</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort, and this reserve now stood him in good stead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the combat, Scott had subsconsciously worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">their position down the fairway toward the ravine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This bit of ring generalship was not premeditated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any definite thought; it was intuitively inspired by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the ground and might, in case of neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sity, be used either as offensive or defensive tactics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he saw through the increasing light, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine falling away only a few yards behind his op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponent. He rushed and his opponent gave ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">step by step as the blows rained over his face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, blows that lacked power, for Scott was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">exerting himself now, but in every one there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient menace. The spy now stood within a yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the steep bank of the ravine and Jerry Scott sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moned all his reserve power for the final blow. Feint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with his left to open his opponent's guard, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped in and as he drove his right home, he raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself on the ball of his foot swinging his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the waist upward into a crashing blow, perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">timed, and directed at just the right upward angle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Austrian was fairly lifted off his feet, his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped and his knees sagged beneath him, then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumpled up and fell backward over the edge, rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down over the jagged rocks until he lay limp, cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bleeding at the bottom of the ravine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Exhausted though he was, Scott made his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly down the ramp to the lower deck where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut a piece of rope from the lashings of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life boats. Returning, he descended into the ravine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bound the hands of his still unconscious ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versary, behind him. The moon had now risen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of the Austrian as he turned it up into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, was fearfully cut and swollen. He ran his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers through the beard covering over the jaw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said as if to himself:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thought I knew you. Don't usually forget a</seg><seg type="columnLine">face." Then he seated himself on a nearby rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted his pipe and waited for his captive's awakening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That Scott had by this time fully recovered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his exertion, was an evidence of the excellent physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition, which it was his habit to maintain to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree seldom found save in the professional athlete.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His life no less than his ideals demanded this, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">177</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the varied exigencies of his wandering career he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was often called upon to endure extraordinary hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships. He had kept the pace with expert mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbers; was a swimmer of no mean attainments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had joined in the arduous life of big game hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in Africa. It had therefore become to him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of pride as well as satisfaction to ever main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that physical condition which made him second</seg><seg type="columnLine">to none in the emergencies of his adventurous life. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had received no hurt in his conflict with the Austrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">save for a slight bruise on his shoulder, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter had struck him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spy moved and opened his eyes. -He made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">futile endeavor to raise his hand to his head, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized for the first time that his hands were bound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was dazed and shook his head from time to time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clear his muddled brain, then as the mind gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally cleared, his cunning reasserted itself and he tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to open conversation with his captor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A ferry great fighter. I could not haf pelief it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a gentleman of science and a so great student."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott knew that the accent was unnecessary, was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact an attempt to mislead him. The spy evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">labored under the delusion that his opponent was Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden. Jerry decided not to enlighten him, so re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained silent and smoked his pipe. The Austrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">meantime had swiftly concocted his story and resumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You surprise me. I tink I am left all alone on</seg><seg type="columnLine">dis island. I stowavay to go to America. You tie</seg><seg type="columnLine">me up. Mebbie you tink I do harm. Not to you enny</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. Once try is enuff. But, tell me why do people</seg><seg type="columnLine">all leaf?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scott was bored by the childish attempt to deceive</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, so he knocked out his pipe on the rock, put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his pocket and said: "Now listen, old timer. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to bluff me. I know more about you than you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">care to listen to. You are a spy and came here to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepare this place •-) a base for the attack of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">European Alliance on the United States." The Austrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed his disappointment, and Scott continued: "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing you and your purpose here. I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take every precaution against your carrying out any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your plans. Get up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He jerked the rope and administered a few light</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicks to his prostrate foe. The Austrian complied</seg><seg type="columnLine">grudgingly and arose stiffly to his feet. Placing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">captive in front of him, Scott prodded him along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the ravine to a flight of steps which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascended. He then conducted his captive in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner, to the hotel and into the private office of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manager. Here he ordered his captive to lie down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a couch in which position he bound him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch and left him. Leaving the room, Scott closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and locked the door, removed the key and placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JERRY SCOTT was well pleased with the outcome of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his evening's adventure, although he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">preferred to defer the encounter, until the spy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">disclosed more fully his plans or those of the Alliance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt somewhat perturbed when he considered, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">by holding the spy captive, he would necessarily cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the source of wireless information to the Alliance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This might make them suspicious and lead to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">check-mating of Holden's plans, but there could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no step backward now. He considered going to Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden's apartment to consult upon the situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was still early in the evening and there was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer need for his remaining in seclusion. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came to him the recollection of the previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, when he had seen the spy retiring in the launch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with this visual reconstitution of the scene, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">saw again the two revolvers that the spy had laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him. Then there came the thought that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spy might still be armed. This thought however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quickly dismissed, for he remembered that he had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on binding the Austrian, almost subconsciously passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand over his assailant's pockets with that military</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of pi*caution acquired during his service in</seg><seg type="columnLine">France, and which, once acquired, never deserts one</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an emergency. Moreover, had the Austrian possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">any weapon, he had had abundant opportunity to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">it during their encounter. Scott decided therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a look at the stowaway's retreat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the launch he struck a match and located the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch which turned on a storage battery light; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">began a systematic search for the missing weapon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As already noted, the Austrian had arrived at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isleport without any baggage, but his overcoat lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">neatly folded up on the cockpit cushions, and in search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the pockets of this coat, Scott found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">billfold containing some papers. Opening this, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched through it for any notes or information and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a sheet of paper he found the message which, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to him had been so laboriously decoded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob Holden and Kitty Cromwell. The message was</seg><seg type="columnLine">given in code together with the key word and decoded</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. It was evidently the sheet on which the spy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had worked out his message before going to the wire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less room to send it. It explained much that Scott</seg><seg type="columnLine">had before only hazily guessed at. The reference to</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nurse X" was particularly illuminating. The woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, was not Bob Holden's wife, but for some un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known reason, his friend was under the care of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurse. Scott felt that he should go immediately to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden and inform him of the message, but if his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend were ill or even recuperating from some con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition which made excitement inadvisable, the meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing should be deferred. After careful consideration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he decided that he would not disturb Holden that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. There was nothing in the message after all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which could not be reasonably delayed until the mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row. Its purport, together with his own appearance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would serve only to excite his friend who would stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">in need of all the rest he could get until the time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the final test came; for Scott was certain that Holden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence boded no good for the cause of the European</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alliance. He would wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finding nothing further of interest in his search of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stowaway's quarters, Scott returned to the scene of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his early evening's combat and searched for the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver of which he had so dextrously relieved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spy. A half hour's careful search of the ground foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">by foot rewarded him, and he picked up the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the spot where it had fallen in some rank grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath overhanging branches. It was a service weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Lugger type. Withdrawing the shell clip he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it filled, and snapping it back into place, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped the weapon into his hip pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the now glorious light of the risen moon, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered over the golf course lost in wonder at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth of talent displayed in the layout. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the tees and took fancied swings at an imaginary</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball that caught the moonbeams as it sailed down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairways now gloriously lighted by the filtered rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">that distilled beneath the upper deck and through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leafy paradise. He ascended to the landing deck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better to view the glories of the heavens, and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Orion climbed the eastern skies and the milky way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a gigantic skip-rope swung over his head; watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">until his restless spirit succumbed to the harmony of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spheres bringing to him a sense of ineffable peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quiet and the memories of nights spent in many</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curious untravelled quarter of the globe. He heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Rupert Brooke, "the calling of the moon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">178</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the whispering scents that strayed about the idle warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoon." On such a night had Cleopatra met Mark</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anthony beside the Sphinx. Memory carried him back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a night when he too had wandered about the The-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ban Oracle and like Napoleon, had visualized the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies that looked down upon him. On such a night</seg><seg type="columnLine">had Lorenzo wooed Jessica in the Gardens of Portia at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Belmont, with those immortal words, "How sweet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight sleeps upon this bank." On such a night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conrad's Lord Jim had seen the lunar orb hovering</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the Red Sea like, "a shaving curled up from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plank of gold." How much of the wealth of history</seg><seg type="columnLine">and literature was indebted to the same moonlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">which now melted from his soul all traces of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flict in which he had earlier engaged, all thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that greater conflict soon to be launched upon this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid-ocean paradise. The red rays of Mars, tradi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional God of War, were tonight dissolved in the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulgence of that nearer neighbor in celestial space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steeped in its peace loving emanescence, Jerry Scott</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered back to the Palm Garden where he had spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the previous night and, finding there the discarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer rug, wrapped himself in it, stretched out upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grassy bank and was soon asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He awoke toward morning with a dash of rain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face. The wind was howling through the palms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the isleport was almost blotted out in the fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the oncoming storm. Groping his way through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain now falling in sheets, he reached the door open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the hall on which his room was located. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered his room, removed his drenched clothing, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bed and slept until the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he finally arose, the storm continued with</seg><seg type="columnLine">unabated fury. Making his way downward to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel kitchen, he prepared breakfast and after eating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed hot coffee and sandwiches on a tray for his cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive. Proceeding through the dining room to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office, he took from his pocket the key to the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ager's office, and was about to unlock the door when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw that it was ajar. He opened it to find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Key and Its Sequel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT may well be that the philosopher Hobbes was right</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his inexorable logic when he reasoned that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolute monarchy was the most efficient form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">government. Certain it is that if one admits his prem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ises, his conclusions follow of necessity. That the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights of individuals are more and more conflicting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion to the congestion of population, is undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly true, and it is for the adjustment of such con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicts of rights that we have our elaborate systems of</seg><seg type="columnLine">courts and governments; but that such a conflict of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights inevitably leads toward war, a ruthless war</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each individual against every other individual, may</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonably be doubted. That war, however, is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest catastrophe that can befall individuals or na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions and is to be avoided at any cost, meets with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartfelt approval. Having arrived at this point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hobbes proceeds to demonstrate that the chief func-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of government is to prevent war; that the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">effectual form of government is that form which most</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiently operates toward this end; and that inas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as absolute monarchy is most potent in this direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, it is therefore, the ideal form of government and</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to be preferred above all other forms. But, what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever may be our ideas concerning the value of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusions, it must be admitted that the effectual</seg><seg type="columnLine">abrogation of war by an individual would certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">bespeak for such an individual that fealty, which has</seg><seg type="columnLine">traditionally been accorded to absolute rulers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While it must be admitted that for Kitty Cromwell,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the question of this or that type of government as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">panacea for war was not one of any considerable im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance, in fact it is to be doubted whether such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question had ever entered her mind, yet, it was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly due to some comparable line of reasoning, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had evolved her allegiance to Bob Holden as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who, she believed was destined to abolish war</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all time. But her allegiance to Holden the scient-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ist, was daily expanding into a more personal interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Holden the man. For between these two there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprung into being a comradeship that absorbed, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out negating, the logic that had given it birth. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out discounting the virtues of the Aristotelian logic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is apparent to all who have struggled through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry as bonedust system of the brilliant Athenian, that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the much abused Platonic friendship of his pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">decessor, it must ever be subservient to the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamic forces of personality. And it had so tran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spired in the daily relations of Holden and Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cromwell, that this latter force was rapidly becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is moreover, one of the happy attributes of per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal interest that, beginning in any one of a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand coincidents, it offers unlimited means for de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopment through the progressive stages of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord, compatibility and congeniality into the rarer</seg><seg type="columnLine">stages of friendship and affection. Into this royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">road tinged with romance and accentuated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeopardy of their situation, Bob Holden and Kitty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cromwell had unconsciously entered; and among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">many circumstances which had contributed to thi3</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevation of their comradeship, none had more effec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually conspired to bring about this mutual attach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment than their conversations. For the art of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation, an art, which like letter writing, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened with extinction in an age when anti-gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment cocktails, bridge and the abrogation of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventions have become the end, rather than the incidents</seg><seg type="columnLine">of social intercourse among the intelligentsia, is one</seg><seg type="columnLine">which lies at the roots of all human achievement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shorn of its fruits, the human race would soon fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">back upon its original atavistic tendencies. For while</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking is an ability inherited along with the vermi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form appendix, the thyroid gland, and the fissure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rolando, the art of conversation which is based upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">this more primitive acquirement, has to do with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression of those finer distinctions of thought which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie at the base of nil human progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the casual observer, Kitty Cromwell may appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a non-contributing member to the duologues in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Bob Holden usually took the leading part; but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inasmuch as conversation requires the incentive of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuasive listener possessing broad interests and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirst for knowledge, she was able to supply the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centive which lured him from the habitual taciturnity</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which it had been his wont to hide from the purely</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquisitive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the art of conversation is only a representative</seg><seg type="columnLine">art whose ultimate limitations are to be found in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the powers of mental discrimination which underlie</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. For it is evident that no expression of ideas may</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceed the ideas themselves, and the subtle use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">words to express the finer shades of meaning must,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the final analysis, rest in the ability of the mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to perceive such differences. Conversation is expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, and just as the musician expresses himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interpretation of a fugue or rhapsody, or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist puts his thoughts, his attitude toward life on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his canvas, so the conversationalist must and does</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he wills it or not, express his evaluation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life's meanings. The question, therefore, of the value</seg><seg type="columnLine">of conversation resolves itself into the more funda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental one of our evaluation of life; and this might bo</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">179</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">interpreted by seme natural classification which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly include the market value, the surface or</seg><seg type="columnLine">superficial value, artistic, and scientific values. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a classification may be illustrated by the attitudes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of different individuals concerning perchance a flower,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let us say an orchid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the admirer who attaches his engraved card and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sends by special messenger to the subject of his devo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, the orchid is an expression of his adoration and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfulness because it is the most expensive of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers. To the woman who decorates herself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its glories, it represents the quintessence of taste and</seg><seg type="columnLine">refinement; an outward and very visible sign of what,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let us hope, is an inward and spiritual grace. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist, it is a symphony in color tones which defies</seg><seg type="columnLine">his consummate skill to depict as he poises on tiptoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bated breath, in the effort to caress into life the</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate tracery of veins and laciness of feathery tex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture which lie mellowed in its tinted pulchritude. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the botanist may know the secret of the slippered door</seg><seg type="columnLine">which closes after the entering bee, forcing him out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the cloistered arches at the base, in order that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he may in so doing, rub his nose against the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truding anthers, thus gathering his load of pollen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be carried to the next flower and so complete the</seg><seg type="columnLine">round of nature in her efforts to reproduce its kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is nothing in the relation of the orchid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corsage that is of fundamental value. Its rarity</seg><seg type="columnLine">designates its market value, and its market value</seg><seg type="columnLine">predicates its social prestige. But beyond this super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficiality, orchids have fundamental values which lift</seg><seg type="columnLine">them high in the scale of eminence, and it is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciation of these deeper values that conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">is lifted out of the chit-chat of social intercourse into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eminence of an art.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As might be surmised. Bob Holden avoided conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the superficial type and it was this fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had caused him to be looked upon as a silent man</seg><seg type="columnLine">immersed in his science, and out of touch with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. But among a select circle of intimates he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known as a brilliant conversationalist when stimulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a responsive environment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitty Cromwell had received a liberal education</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been augmented by an unusual breadth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience. Her training had contributed to her well</seg><seg type="columnLine">balanced mind, a scientific viewpoint, which was deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened by a natural instinct to prefer the real to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblance. One of Emerson's illuminating gems of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought tells us, "God gives to every man the choice</seg><seg type="columnLine">between truth and repose; choose whichever you will,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you cannot have both"; and she had long ago made her</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice. Her thirst for knowledge could never be satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied, but it was not the thirst of the scholar who</seg><seg type="columnLine">spends a life-time on some one of the insignificant</seg><seg type="columnLine">problems of being, but that type of desire which sees</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every thing a mystery to be unravelled, a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty to be unfolded. Life itself was ever an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting adventure, and its disappointments, of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had had a full share, had not sufficed to disillusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, much less to cast her upon the rocks of cynicism</seg><seg type="columnLine">or despair. While possessed of a happy disposition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was not of the Polyanna type, for she had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much of life to believe that there was good in</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything. Rather she sought reality whether good</seg><seg type="columnLine">or evil, and once convinced that a thing was not worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, she merely aiiminated it from her field of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terests. It had been impressed upon her during her</seg><seg type="columnLine">early life, that happiness must come from within, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not so much a matter of the things one possesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was our reaction to the things which make up</seg><seg type="columnLine">our environment. A life of unalloyed happiness is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chimera, for happiness, like gold, must be alloyed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">baser metals to make it enduring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To say, however, that Bob Holden found in Kitty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cromwell that type of character which offered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural complement to his own, would smack of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idealism for which life, with its Babel of purposes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">offers no justification. Both were individuals who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoned clearly upon the experiences which life had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to them, and from the lessons learned, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed a pragmatism which, in the intimacy of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">present associations, offered a common ground where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flowers of their companionship might flourish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DAWN of the day following that on which Rav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowickz had met Kitty Cromwell in the Garden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came reluctantly with a slow gray penetration of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">through clouded skies and a steady down-pour of rain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wind shrieked and howled through the structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sea was lashed by the tempest into a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">foaming fury. It was the same storm-that earlier had</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven Jerry Scott from his bivouac in the Palm Gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den to the shelter of his room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob Holden and Kitty Cromwell had talked late</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the preceding night, and the gray stormy day was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not conducive to early rising. He knew moreover, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no apprehensions concerning the impending attack need</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry them until after the storm had passed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped from his room into the library to find that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Cromwell had preceded him and that breakfast</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ready to serve. A half hour later he lighted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe and left for the laboratory. There was not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be done there now except to wait, but he was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways more at ease when surrounded by the para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phernalia of the realm over which he ruled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as he left the apartment, Kitty Cromwell</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the desk and began to rummage through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawer that was used as a receptacle for a variety of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knick-knacks. From it she selected a complicated look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing key. Taking a small block of wood procured from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a box in the store room, she smeared one of the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces with sealing wax heated in the flame of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">candle, and while the wax was still soft, pressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key into it, producing a clear impression of its sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face grooves and notches. She took pains to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression as clear as possible and in every way</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to carry out the instructions of the spy to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter, in order to deceive him into a complete ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptance of her role as accomplice. The impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, to be sure, of no value, but would, she felt, be</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrumental in postponing any action on his part for</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least another day. Then she donned a slicker and</seg><seg type="columnLine">souwester procured from a closet, and leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment made her way out into the Palm Garden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As she left the shelter of the hotel to cross the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">area by the fountain, the wind almost swept her from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feet but she continued her way with care, clinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">at times to any support that offered, as the gusts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wind tore at her. Finally she reached the shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trees, deposited the block on the table indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the spy, and returned across the storm swept area</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the apartment. Here she removed all traces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wet garments, set the room in order, and spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remainder of the morning in reading; looking out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the windows from time to time to see if the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed any signs of abating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holden responded to her call for lunch. He told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her that during the morning he had been down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pump room and had raised the isleport higher above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waves which had increased with the violence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind. This, he told her, he had intended doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any event as they would be able to see an ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching fleet at a greater distance. He was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that the storm would prevent any attack while</seg><seg type="columnLine">it lasted, but should the skies clear during the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might look for the air fleet on the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">180</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. They would naturally figure on making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing directly after such a blow, depending on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeding season of fair weather. Continuing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "I have been in the habit of locking myself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory and now that there is an enemy on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isleport, this course seems doubly warranted. But one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing has been troubling me, that is, I might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the old attacks and you would not be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach rae."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to the desk and opening the drawer, selected</seg><seg type="columnLine">a key which he handed to her, saying as he did so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here is a key to the hall leading into the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters. Keep it with you for use in an emergency."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she took it her heart almost ceased to beat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she paled visibly. By one of those coincidences which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem ever at hand to tangle the ways of life into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystic maze of uncertainty, he had handed her the</seg><seg type="columnLine">identical key from which she had that morning taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impression. He noticed the change come over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and offered her a chair. But Kitty Cromwell had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooled to action. She had a keen perception of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crisis and knew that nothing could be gained in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a situation by waiting mutely for the blow to fall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden might learn that she had betrayed a trust, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must at all events, be warned against the conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quences of her rash act. Dashing across the room, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the slicker and souwester from the closet 'and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put them on saying as she did so: "Please wait here</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I return. I have something of the greatest im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance to tell you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched her in puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewilderment as she ran from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room, then followed her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer doorway, but made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no effort to stop her. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched her as she crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stormswept area and en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the woods beyond and still stood waiting anxiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She reached the table only to find that the block</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wood that she had placed there a few hours before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone. Then with faltering steps and downcast</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing, she returned. She uttered no word as he fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed her into the library. Then a great weariness</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized her and she dropped limply into a chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said: "To think that I should have even unwittingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">betrayed you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw that she was deeply moved but could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehend the reason. Surely she must be laboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">under some delusion. Then she told him all; how she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had unconsciously been the tool of Dr. Von Sturm;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of her meeting with Ravnowickz on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous day, and of her resolve to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive him with a counterfeit key in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to gain time. As she finished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head sank in her arms and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">body shook with sobs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden came to her where she sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and taking her gently by the shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised her from the chair, turning her</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he did so until she faced him. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slowly tilted her chin upward until</seg><seg type="columnLine">she looked into his eyes and said with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smile suffusing his face, "Kitty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cromwell, you have never betrayed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust. Stop worrying for there is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm done. By telling me all, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have cleared your own actions of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame or doubt. We will go to the lab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">181</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">oratory and put another lock on the door. I have one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I will guarantee against this Ravnowickz no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">how clever or ingenious he may be. We are going to out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wit this spy and those who are behind him. But do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture out on the isleport alone again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her face flushed and the tears stood in her eyes as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she thanked him for his confidence and the courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had given her to carry on. Then they went to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether to the laboratory and added the lock to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. In his company her spirits returned and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled look gradually left her. About mid-after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon the rain ceased and the sun broke through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds, and as they witnessed this transformation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature, the last traces of the clouds that had cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">their shadows within, were swept away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How could they know that the lock was an unneces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary precaution; that her fears had all been groundless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For, less than a stone's throw away, Jerry Scott sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his room wrestling hour after hour with the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery of a block of wood containing a wax impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a key, which had been deposited by Holden's nurse</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a table in the Palm Garden in the midst of a tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rential rain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ravnowickz</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Jerry Scott left the spy bound and</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked in the inner office of the hotel, he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not reckon with the craftiness or ability of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">antagonist. Reasonable consideration of the man whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">the European Alliance had chosen for so important</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enterprise as that entrusted to Ravnowickz, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have indicated that the spy was a man of unusual re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sources. His defeat of the spy in personal combat</seg><seg type="columnLine">had led the usually cautious Scott into underesti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mating the sagacity and ability of his captive, a state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mind which has too often caused the downfall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best laid plans. To men whose lives have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent in outwitting the forces of law and order and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whom captivity is a menace ever lurking in the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediate offing, reflection, aided by a little practice, pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sents a multitude of expedients for release from what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever form of durance is imposed upon them. Alex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">andre Dumas relates how the Due de Beaufort told</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jailer that he had "often thought what he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">do in case he were put into prison" and that "he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out forty ways of escaping."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one of such resources as those with which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spy was endowed, no form of restraint presents less</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulties of escape than that of binding the wrists</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feet with cords, for reflection in an analytical</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner will demonstrate that in order to overcome that</seg><seg type="columnLine">restraint imposed by this form of bondage, it is neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary only to obtain the freedom of one hand. Complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom is then only a matter of the use of the free</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand in undoing the remainder of the bonds. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">annals of criminology are replete with instances of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, who by dint of constant practice from the flex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible years of early childhood, have acquired the ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fold up the hand, laying the thumb over the palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it flattens along the line of the little finger in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a manner that the hand becomes as small in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass as the wrist. Under such circumstances, a bond</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed about the wrist, when loosened slightly by work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, will allow the hand to be withdrawn. A more</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure method of binding is to bind the elbows close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sides of the body, then bind the forearms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists, one in front and the other in back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, in such a manner that even though the bonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were loosened the hands could not be withdrawn. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry Scott was not versed in the ways of the law-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaker, and had not considered the possibility of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">captive's escape. The famous Houdini had developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">this trick to such marvelous perfection that handcuffs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which apparently fitted closely over the wrists, offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">no obstacle to the withdrawal of the hand when folded</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the manner described.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the checquered career of Ravnowickz, we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not concerned except to note that this trick was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">at which he was an adept, and that it had stood him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in good stead on numerous occasions. No sooner had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott's footsteps died away after he had locked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of the room in which his captive lay bound, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spy began the slow straining at the ropes which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew would eventually gain him his freedom. But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">binding the spy, Scott had used the sailor's square knot</seg><seg type="columnLine">which does not loosen under strain. Any flexibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained must be through the gradual stretching of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hempen fibre. Fully two hours had passed before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt the pressure of the rope sufficiently relaxed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin the painful process of withdrawal. His right</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist had swollen under the impact of the blow de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livered by Scott when he had disarmed the spy at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of their encounter, but while the sprain hin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered him greatly in his efforts it also worked indirectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his advantage, for the swollen wrist had prevented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope from being drawn into as small a circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference as that about his uninjured wrist, and once</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strain of the rope was relaxed about this injured</seg><seg type="columnLine">member, the process of withdrawing the hand was</seg><seg type="columnLine">facilitated. With the freedom of his right hand accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished he rested for a time, working his fingers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to restore circulation in them before attacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remaining bonds. With one free hand, the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">extrication from his fetters was a matter requiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a short time. The only bar to his freedom now</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in the locked door. He felt certain that his captor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not return before daybreak and, as the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an inner one devoid of windows, he followed round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls in the darkness until he arrived at the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had noted the position of the push-button for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights when Scott had made use of it the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, and found it without difficulty. The room</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an oblong one of the size of an ordinary office</seg><seg type="columnLine">and contained a desk, a table, couch and chairs. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">large safe was built into an alcove, its door even with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of the room. He considered hiding himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the safe in the hope that when his captor came</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found the room empty, he would go away and •</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the room unlocked. But on second thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that the man whom he thought of as Holden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would quickly reason that he had not left the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would institute a thorough search for him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not care again to engage in a combat with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had already proven himself more than his equal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he had gained a wholesome respect for the athletic</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowess of the man he had encountered the previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. He crossed the room to the door and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful examination of the lock. It was evidently a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high grade of the mortised lock type, not of the tumbler</seg><seg type="columnLine">or night latch variety. It must be locked or unlocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a key and his adversary of the previous night</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken the key with him. It would be an interest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing study for those practical savants of psychological</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, to determine the effect of one's early vocation</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the tendencies of later life. Ravnowickz had, in early</seg><seg type="columnLine">life been a locksmith's apprentice, a calling which opens</seg><seg type="columnLine">into two avenues only slightly divergent at their begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, but widening as they proceed, until their direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions become opposite. It is one of those few trades</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherein too great skill is an almost certain menace</seg><seg type="columnLine">both to society and to the individual that plies it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japanese have a maxim to the effect that, "a perfect vase</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ne'er turned out from a poor potter's wheel,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Americans claim that, "a good workman can use</seg><seg type="columnLine">182</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a poor tool." In the absence of tools, Ravnowickz fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">back on the American aphorism. First, he searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the desk in the hope of finding a duplicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">key, but finding none, his practiced eye fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long metal pin affixed to a base and used as a file</seg><seg type="columnLine">for papers. It could be bent to serve the purpose. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending was accomplished by inserting the point in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack left by the desk drawer, until it resembled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of a skeleton key. With this implement he set</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work upon the lock. It was a slow process; for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was necessary to feel out with great delicacy the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure of the lock, changing the form of the bends</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time to time in order to conform the instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the work to be done. But at last he succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting the dog which locked the bolt in place and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time he threw the bolt sufficiently to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog displaced, then the bolt was turned back and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was opened. He was free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ravnowickz knew that he must seek a hiding place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he could, while remaining himself unseen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">command a view of the approaches. First, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he descended cautiously to the motor launch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured the revolver which he had hidden for safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping, in a small receptacle beneath the motor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Placing this in his coat pocket, he took his overcoat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some food from the stores in the launch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing through the pump and compressor rooms, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the mechanician's bunk room on the lower floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hotel. This was a large room used as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping and lounging room for the crew of me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanics which, under the regular routine of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isleport, had charge of the repairs and equipment. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembled somewhat, the forecastle of an old-time</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailing vessel, having the bunks arranged in tiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the two sides of the room. Selecting an upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk at the far end of the room, commanding a view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the door, he climbed into it and was soon asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JERRY SCOTT displayed a crestfallen countenance</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he stood in the doorway of the room where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left his captive bound on the previous night. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted the loosened knots and ropes and realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had to deal with a man of unusual dexterity. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">work was by no means that of a novice, and by what</seg><seg type="columnLine">means the spy had succeeded in freeing himself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bonds, Scott was at a loss to know. Inasmuch as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spy had undoubtedly possessed himself of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver, it would be dangerous to attempt his recap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. It was better, therefore, to act on the defensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take every possible means for protecting Holden</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Austrian. The spy would now have an addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional incentive for action against his friend, inas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as he labored under the delusion that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden who had made him a captive the night before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott had counted on revealing his presence to Holden</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning, but now, as on a number of previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasions during the past few days, another obstacle</seg><seg type="columnLine">had arisen to prevent it. His role clearly called upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to retain his position as an unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned the tray, on which was the breakfast</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had brought to his whilom captive, to the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen, then ascended through the hotel to 4iis room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The storm was raging without so he pulled his chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside one of the windows where he could read, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time keep an eye on the entrance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden's quarters. For a time he was engrossed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the sheets of rain as they swept across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open area near the fountain. He had sat there for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour or more when he saw a figure in oil skins, emerge</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the door and cross the open area. He knew by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the movements that it was a woman and must there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, be the nurse. She passed out of sight among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees but soon returned and reentered the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He wondered what mission could have led her to ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture out in such a storm. It evidently must be a mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of great importance. He decided to investigate, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting on his storm coat, he pa'ssed through the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slipped out of the opposite side of the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">then around the end beneath the overhanging ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servatory. Crossing the open area, he entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods and was passing a table when he espied a</seg><seg type="columnLine">block of wood, apparently recently placed there, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not rain soaked. Picking it up, he discovered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the under side an impression of a key clearly defined</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sealing wax. Here indeed was a new complication.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden's companion had evidently placed the impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for some one. That it was not for Bob Holden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was certain; equally certain that it was not for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, inasmuch as his presence was unknown to any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. For whom was it then except for Ravnowickz?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was loathe to believe that Holden had a spy in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own camp, yet there was the evidence, and try as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would he could not deny it. He now understood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reference to "Nurse X" in the code message. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to the Austrian and his coworkers by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbol; moreover she had undoubtedly been in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication with the spy. The situation had suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">become extremely complicated. There was a spy within</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a spy without, and it would devolve solely upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to keep them separated, to prevent any communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion between them. He regretted now that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not taken greater pains to incarcerate the spy more</seg><seg type="columnLine">securely. To prevent their communication, meant a</seg><seg type="columnLine">relentless watch over one of them at least, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances it would be easier to watch the spy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus, there was forged another link in the chain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances, that would keep him from revealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to his friend. Bob needed him now as never</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, and the cause of America needed him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictured to himself the intrigue which had placed this</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman near to Holden to report on his every action,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he wondered how much she knew of his experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and of the plans he had consummated to thwart</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy. He felt certain that since that night when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen the spy enter the wireless room, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">further messages had been sent. Following the send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of that message, he had shadowed the spy to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch and on last night had made him a captive. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">all probability, Ravnowickz had been on his way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wireless room last night when they met on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golf course. It was possible, to be sure, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spy had sent a message after he had broken his cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivity early that morning. Scott doubted this how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. His escape had been a matter which had un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly occupied him for some considerable time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the thought came that the spy might have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistance. But this was discarded as improbable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not possible for the nurse to have known of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captivity of her ally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry Scott spent the remainder of that day in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Shortly after noon he was surprised to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurse emerge a second time from the doorway and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again cross the open area only to return a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes later. He could not, from where he sat, see Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden, who stood a little back from the open door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott was infuriated at what he thought to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deception of this woman. He again donned his coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hat, and made his way out into the Palm Garden</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the table where he expected to find some message</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the spy, but he found nothing. He searched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings but the search was unavailing so he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to his room. He was nonplussed to account for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this second appearance. It did not fit in with any ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional explanation. Why should she have made that</seg><seg type="columnLine">second trip through the storm unless,--yes, that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it; she wanted to be certain that the spy had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">183</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the block with the key impression. She was afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that possibly Holden might discover it. He took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">block from his pocket and examined it more closely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he went out into the hall and up to the next floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally stopping before the door that opened from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall of Holden's apartment into the hotel hallway. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was securely fastened. He doubted if it were ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">used. He compared the key impression with the lock</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the door but found no similarity. The key was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of a complicated form of tumbler lock while that</seg><seg type="columnLine">required for the door was of a different type. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">next went back to his room and putting on his coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hat, went out and around the hotel to the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">door to the apartment. Here he made another com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parison as to the key, but with like results. The key</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression must therefore, apply to some door within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apartment, probably to the door into the labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tories. The spy evidently had a means of ingress</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the outer door, or it would be opened for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from within. Well, he and not the spy had the pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tern of the key.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the coming of night, Scott put on his sweater</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sallied forth. He crossed the open area to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the palms, and placed a bench under a conveni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent cover of overhanging shrubbery. This afforded him</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unobstructed view of the door across the open space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he could see without being seen. The rain had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the air damp and chilly so he returned to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and procured a steamer rug to wrap about him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ocean had subsided with the falling of the wind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he noticed that the isleport rode higher above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rollers. Could this be the result of some automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">provision that raised it above the reach of the storm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed waves or had it been raised by Holden for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other purpose? The attack, he felt certain, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">near at hand and Holden was unquestionably taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">every precaution and making final preparations for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master stroke against the militant forces of Europe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE night dragged slowly along. Occasionally the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chirrup of a cricket waked the echoes of the wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a bird stirred uneasily in the branches. Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott breathed with deep regularity, but he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep. Through his stream of consciousness trouped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the images of the past; the scenes of war and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendships of peace mingling incongruously in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream as it carried on. Now he drifted over a tropic</seg><seg type="columnLine">isle to the whirring beat of an airplane propellor;</seg><seg type="columnLine">anon he painted. He often painted in his dreams and</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-conscious visions, and always it was the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the winsome blue eyes and the raven hair, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as he tried to catch the elusive charm, it faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vanished. He was not asleep but he had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the art of jungle rest--rest that leaves the mind tuned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to arouse the body at the subconscious perception of</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. The moon had risen behind banks of fleecy</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds and barely lighted the wall of the hotel, wrap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping it rather in a dark gray mysteriousness which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes unaccustomed to the darkness would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">black as Erebus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he raised himself on his elbow and peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the shelter of his leafy bower. Automatically</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand drew the revolver from his pocket. A dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow was gliding stealthily along the wall, pausing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time to time to listen, then slipping along again</seg><seg type="columnLine">with noiseless tread. Before the door to Holden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters it paused and knelt before the lock. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the clear round ray from a pocket flash light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At intervals he could hear a faint rattling as of a key</seg><seg type="columnLine">or tools. He considered taking a pot shot at the spy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was war, but his sportsman's instinct revolted at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought of shooting a man in the back. Then too</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wondered if the nurse would appear to hold mid-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">night converse with her ally. He would wait and see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A window above and to the right of the door opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealthily. Scott could hardly repress the feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">indignation that boiled within him. They would meet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these two, in order to plot against his friend. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would see to it that there was not much plotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. He leveled his revolver at the spy. Then on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stillness of the air a shot rang out. He watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the would be house breaker as he fled precipitately</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the end of the hotel through the overhanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">archway. Then he saw through the open window a</seg><seg type="columnLine">room suddenly flooded with light and heard a woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice answering to Holden's call. Dim in the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw a figure in dressing gown cross the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the door, and he knew that it was the nurse who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fired at Ravnowickz.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry Scott had an analytical mind. Those con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusions often attributed to the much overworked</seg><seg type="columnLine">faculty of intuition, came to him in a far more logical</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. Thus, it had transpired, that of the various</seg><seg type="columnLine">events taking place on the isleport, he had arrived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the true significance of all save in the one matter of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">classification of Kitty Cromwell as an ally of the Aus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trian. His error in this one instance was but natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was therefore pardonable, and all the more so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that he had never seen her face nor had any com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication with her, for it is harder to misjudge those</seg><seg type="columnLine">we know than those who are strangers to us. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible that a more intimate knowledge of feminine</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychology would have caused him to hesitate before</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming any conclusion however sustained by appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances. In his favor however, be it said, that in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">varied wandering career, he had probably seen more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of woman at her worst than at her best. Yet he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never become convinced of the justice of the Kipling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esque version. To say the least, he was now in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quandary. He felt that somewhere his analysis had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped a cog. It was obviously unreasonable that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same woman who, earlier in the day, had provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ally with a key, should shoot at him when he at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to pick a lock. Yet these were the facts which</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded an explanation and try as he might, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find no solution to the riddle. That the nurse</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aware of the identity of the man at whom she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fired, could not be doubted, as so far as she knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Austrian was the only person on the isleport</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the exception of herself and Holden. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the earlier experiences of that day, the shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was deliberately incongruous. From the standpoint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shooting, why had she provided him with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression of the key? There certainly must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">some earlier collusion between them. But summing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the evidence, the affair of the key was decidedly cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstantial, while the shooting was a fact, the obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention of which it was impossible to deny. In fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness to her therefore, he must take the shooting as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an indication of her real attitude toward the spy. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">view made his own work easier and gave to him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater peace of mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this problem settled, even though it lacked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonable explanation, he rolled the blanket about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and stretched himself upon the bench. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain there for a few hours to see if anything further</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened and if not would go to his room. In his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">action to the excitement and the lightening of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">burden of anxiety for Holden, he soon found rest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. It was nearly morning when he rose from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench and sought his bed. Long before that hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some twelve hundred miles to eastward, the camp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy was astir and the plateau which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed from a distance a few days before, resounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the whir of planes. The attack on America was</seg><seg type="columnLine">under way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">184</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg><seg type="columnLine">Exit--Ravnowickz</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MORNING dawned bright and clear. All traces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yesterday's storm was banished in the danc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sunbeams of a new day. The rollers having</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent themselves in their mad race, now came in steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">succession grouping themselves in triads with slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthened pauses between group and group. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds sang in the trees and nature was bathed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Breakfast on the isleport. In the apartment, Holden</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Kitty Cromwell talked on the spy and his mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night escapade. "Can't see how I missed him," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but he certainly had a surprise. Lock-picking must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a favorite occupation with him. I wonder that he even</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked for a key impression to the laboratory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is as well that you missed him," replied Holden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"for it will be a lesson to him. Even though we are at</seg><seg type="columnLine">war it seems rather personal to kill a man when not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the heat of battle. You see I am not much of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">killer. I know that I shall have plenty of it to do, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">my war experience was not on the fighting front."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hate it all," she answered, "but I know that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">success of your plans will never be assured until this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ravnowickz is put beyond the power to do you harm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the ultimate success of the thing you would do, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would gladly kill him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his upper bunk in the mechanician's room, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject of their conversation lay nursing a slight flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound in his left hand where a bullet, after perforat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his cap and missing his head only by the fraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an inch, had halted the application of his lock-pick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing prowess. He was angry, but had he known who</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired the shot, the vials of his wrath would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked him as he munched the remnants of food</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured from the locker of the launch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the hotel kitchen, Jerry Scott wrestled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enigma of a shot fired by one whom he had only yes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terday accounted as an ally of the spy, while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">busied himself in the exercise of his culinary skill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Breakfast over, Bob Holden insisted that Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cromwell accompany him into the laboratory. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not allow her again to run the risk of meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their enemy. Moreover, he felt that this day would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring about the culmination of that for which they so</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously waited. They had been in the observatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a short time when a small buzzer attached to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">microphone detector announced the distant approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">of airplanes. Holden stepped to the small table on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the microphone rested, and adjusted a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">head-phones to his ears. He slowly turned a dial and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently announced the approach of a fleet of several</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes from the East. In some twenty or thirty min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes they would be in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the same calm assurance that she had noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his actions on the day he had saved the isleport</seg><seg type="columnLine">from sinking, he now set about making the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparations for his master stroke against the King-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom of Mars. He threw a switch that started a motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slowly and steadily she saw the great leaves which</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the semi-spherical dome, open and roll aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">folding themselves downward into the sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room until the entire top was opened to a level with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing deck. Still other switches turned on series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of turbines in the tubes, which were not ordinarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">used for the routine power requirements, until the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire power equipment of the isleport was running and</seg><seg type="columnLine">available for use in the positive ray. He next turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current through the bank of vacuum tubes, ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justing it until they showed just the right uniform</seg><seg type="columnLine">flow, watching as he did so a number of meters in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to obtain the necessary balance and steadiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Again she noted that his hand often lingered on some</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of apparatus, caressing it as she had often seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers stroke some favorite rifle or machine gun, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mute expression of their faith in and reliance upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">implement of destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wind was blowing steadily from the north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">east and the isleport had swung with it so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow-shaped end of the hotel and the circular room</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced in that direction. The cable which attached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isleport to the buoy was augmented by an additional</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable from each end of the isleport to the buoy. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking up on either of these auxiliary cables by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a winch, the structure could be swung so as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter the wind. In the present position however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attacking planes coming from the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Azores, would approach the isleport at an angle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about forty-five degrees from the long side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With everything tuned for the impending attack they</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited, listening from time to time to the advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes with the head-phones. Suddenly he took her by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand and led her back into the laboratory where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gathered up an armful of coats and blankets. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">will need these," he said, "for it will be cold. The ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the ray draws the heat from the surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">air into its path. Near to the point where it meets</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a dense material the heat would be intolerable, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will be far away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back again in the observatory they mounted the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erating platform. He explained to her the simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of sighting the tube and showed her the pedal</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, when pressed downward, connected the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a series of rheostats to the tube. For great</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance or increased power, the pedal should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed clear down. She wondered vaguely whether it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would work; it was all so involved yet so simple in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation. It was hardly more revolutionary however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than his isleport scheme must have appeared when</seg><seg type="columnLine">first proposed, and her confidence in him was supreme.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then far away to the eastward a speck floated out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gray for an instant into the sunlight. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary circumstances, it might have been a ray of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight flashing from the white wings of a gull.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden picked up a pair of binoculars, focussed them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then slowly swept the heavens from side to side, paus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at intervals as he did so. His hand showed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest tremor, but his voice vibrated with something</seg><seg type="columnLine">more akin to eagerness than excitement as he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glasses to her saying; "It is the first squadron of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scout planes--ten in all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Little by little the planes emerged from the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, taking on more definiteness of form as they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. On and on they came until their arrow-like forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was distinguishable. Like a flock of wild geese</seg><seg type="columnLine">they flew, to right and left of their leader, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane stepped back in order to those ahead room</seg><seg type="columnLine">for change of speed or direction without the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility %f mishap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holden had once hunted partridges in the North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">west, and had learned that a flock treed at dusk may</seg><seg type="columnLine">all be bagged if the lowest bird is picked off first, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next higher. By this means the falling of a bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tree does not disturb the other birds above</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. it had been his intention to take the leading plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, but by some peculiar operation of the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious mind, this hunting experience now came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. He would let the leaders come on without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the fate of those behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were flying at an altitude of about three thous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feet and had reached a distance of nine or ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from the isleport, when he suddenly sprang into</seg><seg type="columnLine">action. Sighting the tube at the outermost plane on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left of the fan shaped line, he stepped on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">185</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dlvl"io" of airplanes. Scott mounted the pedestal and in an instant Kitty Cromwell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">y h"? not 'onff to wait . . . Jerry Scott marvelled at the silent destruction that followod; a rapid succession of flashes_</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a lew wisps of smoke floating away on the hreexe--just an Instant ol time, then nothln«ness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">186</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pedal. The air about them was filled with an acrid</seg><seg type="columnLine">ozonizing odor; a path of faintly violet tinted light</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out from the tube in the direction of the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant plane. Out where the plane had been, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a soundless flash and a patch of white smoke drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazily on the wind like a small feathery cloud, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of the winged messenger of war was empty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no falling of debris, no buckling of wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">or stays; just an instantaneous change of matter back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the original gases from which, aeons ago, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been formed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOLDEN hardly waited to note these effects. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw only that the plane had vanished, then swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tube to the other end of the line to catch the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">farthest in the rear. There was no instant of wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, no moment between action and result. Simultan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eous with the pressure on the pedal, came the flash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the puff of white smoke, and the space where a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment before a mighty bird had flown, was a void.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On and on came the squadron, and as they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden swung the tube from side to side with noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less precision and deadly accuracy. With each swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the pressure of the foot, the flash and puff of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke. The leaders were unaware of the fate of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">following. Their eyes were fixed on the tranquil ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearing isle ahead, their thoughts conjured up no</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision of the destruction awaiting them. On and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came, and as they came they vanished one by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one until the leader alone was left. Suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot had a premonition of something wrong and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. He was all alone. Had he outdistanced his</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrades? He banked his plane wheeling to right, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late. Came the pressure on that pedal and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky was clear save for some little patches of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke that marked the effacement of the squadron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conflict had lasted but a few minutes, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">during its progress there had come an ever increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">draught of cold air as the heat from the surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere was drawn into the path of the ray. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excitement of the conflict, they had failed to notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">the benumbing cold, but now Holden grabbed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket and wrapped it about her and put on a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket and gloves. All about them the isleport had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken on a coating of hoar-frost. But with the cessa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the ray there came with equal suddenness the</seg><seg type="columnLine">melting of the frost in the warm rays of the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE allies had made thorough plans for their coup</seg><seg type="columnLine">against America. Landing fields had been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed both on Fayal and St. Michaels, and immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">stores of oil, petrol and other supplies had been gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered. Tank boats were already on their way with</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplies for the isleport base. The work had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried on as already noted, under the guise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">agricultural developments. With the inauguration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">war, a thousand planes had set out from various parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Europe for their point of mobilization in the Azores.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the plans of the European Alliance, Isleport Num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber Two was a key position of the highest importance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since the record breaking flight of Colonel Charles A.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lindbergh in 1927, there had been hundreds of sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilarly successful crossings, but there had also been</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous disasters. The use of large many-motored</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes however, had made the passage relatively safe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but until the launching of the isleport enterprise, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem of fuel carriage had been one of the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstacles. In the matter of the attack now to be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">on America, a mid-ocean base was of paramount im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance. It would be necessary to send out several</seg><seg type="columnLine">divisions of planes each day which, after bombing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seaboard cities, would return to their isleport base to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">replenish their store of ammunition and fuel. Not less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a thousand planes would be thus engaged, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a foregone conclusion that many of these would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost and a constant source of replacement must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided. The European Alliance had mobilized five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand planes for this purpose which were distrib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uted thus; a thousand on the fighting front; another</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand in the Azores; and the balance to be drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">on as needed from the reserves in Europe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the third or fourth day after the first attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the seaboard cities, a combined air and naval at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack would be made on New York. The reduction of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few cities such as Boston, New York, Philadelphia and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington it was thought, would bring about a hasty</seg><seg type="columnLine">armistice and peace. In order to launch the attack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planes were to leave the Azores for Isleport Num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber Two, in the following order. First, a squadron of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten scout planes to prepare the isleport. Following</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, a half hour later, a full division of fifty planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">including ten large bombers. Finally, at intervals of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours, four more divisions of fifty planes each.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This would give time for lowering the planes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing deck and storing them on the decks below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The landing deck was equipped with derricks for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoisting and lowering of planes, also with catapults</seg><seg type="columnLine">for starting them off. Most of the planes were equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">for landing either in water or on the land, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing deck presented less difficulties and would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to full capacity. On the second day it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned to send fifteen more divisions to the isleport</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus making up the full fighting force of a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes. A naval squadron was also timed to arrive on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second day and would include a number of air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft motherships which would aid in operations at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front and provide storage for a number of planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as means for the repair of minor injuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob Holden had no certain knowledge of the stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendous scale of operations planned by the European</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alliance, but none were more familiar than he with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aircraft resources of Europe and he had calculated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with remarkable precision, the details of the attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus, he reasoned that the squadron of scout planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be followed shortly by a larger division and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work was only begun when the first squadron was</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed. In the interval following the annihilation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the scout squadron, he was busy making readjust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments in the apparatus in order to conserve as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">power as possible. As long as the wind continued at</seg><seg type="columnLine">its present rate the supply was sufficient for the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quirements, but he' did not care to be throw too</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly upon his storage battery reserve. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the larger division which would follow would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quire greater power as the tube would be in operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">during a longer period of time. In case of necessity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could of course let them come closer and cut down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power by decreasing the range. Such a procedure</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, would expose the isleport to the enemies'</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine guns and must unquestionably place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeopardy the outcome of the war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes sped quickly by and then to the anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchers, a group of small specks appeared almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">simultaneously in the eastern sky. A few minutes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the group had spread out fan like as those farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">away came into view. Their formation was like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the previous squadron except that the heavier bomb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing planes were concealed behind the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wedge in a position where they would be protected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attack planes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holden now perceived that the plan of attack which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had followed in dealing with the scout squadron</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be feasible in meeting the attack of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger division. The positive ray tube was provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">187</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with an automatic moving device which acted on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pivot of the tube, moving it through an arc from left</seg><seg type="columnLine">to right or vice versa in much the same manner as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that on an astronomical telescope which may be set</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow a star throughout the night. This mechanism,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when thrown into gear, moved the tube almost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceptibly, sweeping the ray through a segment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space and destroying everything in the vertical plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which it passed. For while the ray was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated along parallel lines, it spread out slightly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vertical plane. An inch of movement of the tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the circumference of its twelve inch disk, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweep the ray through a six mile arc at a distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten miles from the isleport, and this movement would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take approximately two minutes to accomplish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOLDEN now decided to aim the tube slightly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left of the outermost plane and engage the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gears of the moving device. Then as he pressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedal down, a slight motion to the side would lock it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">place until released, and the ray would be in continu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous action during the time it was thus locked. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpendicular spreading out of the ray would prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plane from escaping it by diving or seeking higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitudes. The division was now in full view, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that it would be necessary to let the foremost</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane approach to within about eight miles before be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning the attack. He knew that they carried no</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns that could reach the isleport at more than five</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles even though they desired to do so. They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally expect that the scout division had made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing and stowed away their planes on the decks</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, and would entertain no suspicion that the isle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port was in the hands of an enemy. But in the event</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they became warned through the destruction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their planes, and should open fire on the defenders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the automatic moving device would enable Holden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitty Cromwell to seek shelter behind the light steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the circular room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On they came, a magnificent sight, thrilling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">potential power; a flock of birds carrying with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elements of human destiny. Holden had a sickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense at thought of the destruction he was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplish, but he set his teeth and hardened himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the counter thought of the destruction of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fenseless women and children, which it was their mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion to consummate, and which he alone could frus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate. Ten miles, nine, eight; he aimed the tube,</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked in the moving device and pressed and locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pedal in position. A flash, a puff of smoke, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">another and another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were both so intent upon their work that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to notice a figure stealthily emerging from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ramp on the landing deck some thirty yards in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear. Barely half a minute had elapsed after Holden</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked in the pedal, thirty seconds during which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low hum of whirring propellors was carried faintly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on the wind. Suddenly the nearer air was broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a shot and Bob Holden dropped to the platform.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitty Cromwell's revolver was in her hand as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled to face Ravnowickz coming over the landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck but quickly as she fired, her shot was as the echo</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another report from the direction of the ramp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ravnowickz' revolver dropped from his relaxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers and his hand clutched his breast. Slowly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun round with sagging knees, lurching as he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so nearer and nearer to the edge of the landing deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with a final plunge, he hung for half a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the edge and, as his muscles stiffened, the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">balanced over and was carried down into the ocean far</seg><seg type="columnLine">below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott Renews a Friendship</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the morning of the first day's battle, Scott and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ravnowickz were each in the lower part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure, while the defeat of the scout squadron</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being silently accomplished by Holden in the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular room. On his way down to the hotel kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he breakfasted, Scott had left the hotel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped silently around the outer door of Holden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment to search for any visible signs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Austrian's midnight escapade. He found a few drops</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood on the door sill but reasoned that inasmuch</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Ravnowickz had run away, he was not seriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">disabled. The spy had undoubtedly received a warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would keep him in hiding until the time for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack. Following out his plan of keeping watch over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spy, immediately after his breakfast, Jerry Scott</seg><seg type="columnLine">secreted himself in one of the sand traps on the golf</seg><seg type="columnLine">course where he could keep watch of the ramp leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the upper decks. Here he stretched himself on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the banks peering over the edge through a cluster</seg><seg type="columnLine">of branches that fringed the upper surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warm sunshine was slanting in at the sides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the structure drying up the moisture left by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm of the preceding day. Suddenly as he lay there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he became chilled to the marrow and at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came to him the odor of ozone that is character-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istic of violent electric discharges. As he pondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">over whether to leave his hiding place in search of</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmer clothing, there came a coating of frost that</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the grass and all parts of the structure. Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veling at this sudden glacial temperature, his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought was that an iceberg was approaching. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea was promptly dismissed, however, as it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the season for bergs and, in any case, the isleport was</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected against them at all seasons by the warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of the Gulf Stream to the North of it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold passed as quickly as it had come and the frost</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared almost instantaneously. Astounded by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">vagary in the program of nature, Scott again crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his covert. In vain he strove to account for it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hardly be a work of nature; it must be in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way connected with Bob Holden. He knew the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">measurable resources of the man; knew that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparing to unsheath some prodigious weapon of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science against the powers of Europe; knew also that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever be the nature of his cowp, it would be an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heralded use of forces as yet unknown to science.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden had probably been giving his apparatus a final</seg><seg type="columnLine">test and this subversion of elemental forces was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">product or a by-product of the forces he had har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed from the ether of space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay there for fully twenty minutes after the frost</seg><seg type="columnLine">had melted, thinking over these matters and watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time, the ascent from the lower deck. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aroused from his thoughts by a tautening of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles for he had experienced that indefinable sensa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion not to be ascribed definitely to the action of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular sense; a feeling as of footsteps coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealthily up the ramp. His alert senses were quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">justified, for as he looked, there appeared first the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, then the shoulders, then the full form of the Aus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trian. As he reached the deck he turned and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight toward where Scott lay concealed until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the bottom of the ascent to the third deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turning, he ascended the ramp on tip-toe to the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">above. Scott noted that his left hand was bound up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a handkerchief, the right hand he carried in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket of his coat. No sooner had he passed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight on the deck above, than Scott followed. In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand he carried the Lugger pistol ready for instant ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Following his quarry, Scott shortened the dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">188</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tance between them as they approached the landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. For a second time during the last twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours he was strongly tempted to shoot, but could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring himself to the point of shooting even this enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the back, except as a last resort. He felt, more-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, that he had the situation well in hand, as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a position to thwart any attempt of the spy directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his friend. But Scott did not know of the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation on the landing deck; of the defeated squadron</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the oncoming division of airplanes. Nor was he</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of the exposed position of Bob Holden on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operating platform, inasmuch as he had never seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome opened or known of anything connected with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner arrangement of the circular room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the head and shoulders of the spy rose above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the level of the landing deck, Scott, who was stealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the ramp behind him, saw him crouch low and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same moment there came to his ears the unmis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takable hum of distant airplanes. The destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Ravnowickz saw already in progress as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">readied the landing deck, was responsible for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">abrupt action. From his position now half way up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ramp, Scott saw his quarry suddenly rise upright</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, simultaneously with the movement, his hand shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward from his pocket, and Jerry sensed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand contained a weapon. The bark of the spy's auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic was echoed by that of Jerry Scott's, and his in</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn was re-echoed from the opposite side. As he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">with long strides up the ramp, he saw Ravnowickz take</seg><seg type="columnLine">his headlong plunge over the edge; another moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was standing at the edge of the circular room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dazed at the rapidity of the events of the last few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments; his mind swamped by the avalanche of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensory impressions, each separate phase of the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">left a concrete and indelible picture upon his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the tube with its violet tinted ray reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the offing. Far in the distance airplanes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being dissolved, one by one, into the void; a flash and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little white cloud, then nothingness; this repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and over again with the rapidity of machine gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. Down in the well, a woman sustained the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob Holden on her lap as she sobbed out his name and</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered his forehead and lips with kisses. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to the platform beside them, she turned her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward toward him, and only the railing saved him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from falling as he staggered backward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God,--Kathleen Riley,--how,--where did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from?" She looked at him for a moment, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed her hand across her eyes as if to wipe away</seg><seg type="columnLine">an illusion of the senses. Then she said, "You,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holden's eyes opened and stared questioningly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry Scott. Then rousing himself as if by a supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort, he said, "the airplanes." They looked and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">6ky was clear. All had vanished. With clearing con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness, Holden spoke again, "the pedal--quick--</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't waste power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitty Cromwell grasped his meaning not clear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott, and disengaged the pedal and moving device.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She then proceeded to examine Holden's wound. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet had entered high up behind the left shoulder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade, passing through the shoulder and out of the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast. The shock of the bullet had made him un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious. Holden refused to be taken to his room</seg><seg type="columnLine">so they propped up his head on some blankets and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the laboratory from which they brought a couch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">first aid case. In the laboratory, she laid a hand upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm and said, "Jerry, I have taken my mother's</seg><seg type="columnLine">maiden name of Kitty Cromwell and that is the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">by which Bob knows me." He nodded in assent; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no time for further talk at present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RETURNING to the circular room, Jerry picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend from where he lay on the platform, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenderly carried him down the steps where he laid him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the couch. Here they cut away the clothing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wound and Kitty Cromwell dressed and bandaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as well as the conditions would permit. Holden was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still suffering severely from the shock of the bullet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so she administered a hypodermic of glycerine sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitrate to stimulate his heart action. Then, propped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on pillows and wrapped in blankets, Holden gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions for their preparations to meet the attack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next division. They would still have, in all prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability, an hour or more in which to make ready.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meantime, he would have an explanation for the sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den appearance of his friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry explained briefly how he had followed Rav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowickz from Budapest to the isleport, and how on</seg><seg type="columnLine">various occasions, he had been deterred from making</seg><seg type="columnLine">his presence known to them; he went into but few de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails, however, and was careful to conceal any account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his suspicions of Kitty Cromwell. He told of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiences of that morning leading up to the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the spy, then turning to her he said: "Every time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	shoot an Austrian, I meet you. This is the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and it happaned to be the same Austrian."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how," she queried, "you do not mean that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ravnowickz was--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, the old scar I gave him the first time, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden by the beard. I recognized him when I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in Budapest and later looked up his record in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris. He was first known to you by the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Von Polits. His name was Ravnowickz Von Polits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His father was Austrian and his mother, Hungarian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took an important part in the red revolution of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bela Kun under his mother's name, and afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped into Austria. In later years, however, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been mostly in Hungary. He had been mixed in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">political upheaval of both countries for many years</seg><seg type="columnLine">either as a Bolshevist or a revolutionary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was sure I had seen him before," she replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Seen him before? I don't understand," said Holden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had just begun to think clearly over the perplex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing problems that had been so suddenly thrust upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind. "And you knew Jerry before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Jerry and I are old friends, but you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">not excite yourself now. The story can wait. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we cannot delay any longer our preparations for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next division." Kitty Cromwell then went over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus with Scott, showing him its essential work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing features. Then Holden discussed with him some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the more intricate points, showing him which meters</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gauges were to be watched, and how the currents</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the rheostats were synchronized. While not</seg><seg type="columnLine">technically versed in mechanical and electrical theory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry Scott soon mastered the essential working de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails. At times, as Holden lay on the couch giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions, he would close his eyes and bite his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the twinges of pain shot through him. Kitty Crom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well was most anxious concerning the result of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock on his heart, and was constant in her atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions and watchfulness over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before their preparations were fairly concluded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden, whose couch was placed close to the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">which held the microphone detector, announced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach of the second division of airplanes. Scott</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted the pedestal and in an instant Kitty Crom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well was beside him. They had not long to wait. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the approaching division in their wedge shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation. As she had already witnessed the destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of two squadrons, Scott now depended on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment as to the distance at which they were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin their work of destruction. On they came, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten, then eight miles away; she gave him the signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">189</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not tho roll o! explosions nor yet the crashing of falling debris;it was more like the roar of a series of conflagrations, the Grushin#</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Infinite matter to fill the void where matter had beon dissolved. Thero was a hissing of the waters with clouds upon clouds of steam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a moment before, had been ten miles of ships, the pride of Europe's mighty navies. Only the troubled waters now marked the place</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where they had so proudly floated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">190</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and he sighted the tube, then threw in the gears of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moving device and pressed and locked down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry Scott marvelled at the silent destruction that</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed; a rapid succession of flashes,--a few wisps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke floating away on the breeze,--just an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant of time, then nothingness. Some of the planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing their comrades being annihilated, tried to dive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cross below the others, but they only dove into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silent death. It was inescapable and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time to send out a message of what was happen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Just a change of state of matter from solid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaseous form; a sudden release of energies pent up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the atom since the beginning of time; a flash as</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the atoms reunited with the oxygen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. Death to those who guided the planes, was pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, simply an instantaneous physical dissolution. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment they were, the next they were not. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no struggling, no wracking of the body with pain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no clogging at the throat as with poisonous gases. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">aftermath of maimed bodies and sightless eyes, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of hopeless suffering. Just the final ultimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of time moved up to the present. It was war,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but war stripped of its terrors and, best of all, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was war that would make war henceforth forever</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The annihilations of the third, fourth and fifth divi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">6ions that afternoon was as complete as had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of the morning. Following the fifth division,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a long period of waiting. They had timed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearances of the other divisions and found a two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour interval between them so, after two and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours had passed with no indication of approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes on the microphone, it was decided that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no longer any reason for remaining at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">station. The allies would time their flight so as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to arrive at the isleport during the daylight hours, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to avoid confusion and accidents. The sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now not over an hour above the western horizon so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Holden's direction, Jerry Scott opened the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">switches and closed the leaves of the dome in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to protect the apparatus from the corrosive effects</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the salt air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the latter hours of the day, Holden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound had been giving him more trouble and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitty Cromwell wished to give it a more thorough</seg><seg type="columnLine">examination and treatment than had been possible when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had first dressed it. The hotel was equipped, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ocean liner, with an operating room which for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately was located on the upper floor, this being</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the same level as that of the apartment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratories. From this room, Scott procured an oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ating table to which they transferred the wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and wheeled him into the operating room. Holden</seg><seg type="columnLine">objected at first, to being treated as a casualty, main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining that his wound was merely a flesh wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that he was perfectly able to walk, but his nurse</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded implicit obedience, in which demand she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ably seconded by Jerry Scott. In the well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted operating room, Kitty Cromwell went about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her work with that quiet efficiency and assurance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been acquired on the fighting front when doctors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scarce. She found an able assistant in Jerry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had likewise had a valuable training in the care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wounded both during wartime and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle. The operating room was equipped with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">X-ray tube with the use of which she had a reason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able degree of familiarity. Holden directed them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter of the current controls in order to obtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right quality of light for a fluoroscopic examina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, for neither felt competent for the more technical</seg><seg type="columnLine">process of taking a photograph, nor did the time per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mit. They were principally concerned with the detec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of any splinters of bone from the shoulder-blade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the examination revealed two such slivers which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been partly torn off by the bullet. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">were removed after administering a local anaesthetic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inasmuch as they considered that Holden's heart might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be affected by complete anaesthesia. Cauteries were</seg><seg type="columnLine">then prepared and inserted into the wound both from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back and from the chest. These would be left in</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a day or so to insure thorough disinfection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound. It was not necessarily a dangerous wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">except as any wound may be dangerous. Holden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous condition must be taken into account, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day had been an arduous one. They bandaged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound with antiseptic dressings and bound the arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a fixed position in order to prevent irritation</seg><seg type="columnLine">through movement. Holden was then placed in a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clining wheel chair and conveyed to his apartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob Holden was overjoyed at the timely appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his friend. There was much to talk over, but Scott</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized the necessity for keeping his friend from too</seg><seg type="columnLine">great excitement and therefore, did most of the talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing himself. He led them through-Ais travels and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventures in remote parts of the world, but he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not once allude to his former acquaintance with Kitty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cromwell. He told them more in detail of his chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting with Ravnowickz in Budapest and of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation he had overheard which led to his following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spy, but he did not mention again his recognition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Austrian, nor any of the circumstances of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">former meeting during the World War. This would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have involved the story of Kitty Cromwell and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hers to tell whenever she should wish to do so. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of his combat with the spy on the golf course</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of the subsequent escape of the latter from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room where he had been left bound, was received</seg><seg type="columnLine">with enthusiasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And all that," responded Kitty Cromwell, "was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking place while we sat here knowing nothing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, not even of your presence on the isleport."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even Ravnowickz," he replied, "did not know of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you mean, he did not know of it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He thought he was fighting Bob, and could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand how such a great student should also be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to conquer him in personal combat. But there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">something for you to explain, Kitty Cromwell. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that shot you fired last night?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you knew of that also. Has anything transpired</seg><seg type="columnLine">here that you did not know about? Perhaps you also</seg><seg type="columnLine">know about the code message he sent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scott repeated it almost verbatim, to their utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement. He then told them how he had ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained the message, and also of his midnight vigil on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the previous night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," she said, "that there is no use trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide anything from you, so I will lay bare my vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lainous alliance and cast myself upon your mercy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she told of Dr. Von Sturm; of her interview with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spy and his demand for the wax impression of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">key to Holden's laboratory. But when Jerry produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the block of wood containing the impression, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket where he had deposited it on the day before, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room echoed and re-echoed with their laughter. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the merriment had subsided, she suddenly turned upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her would-be tormentor, with: "Now Jerry, honor</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, you thought Bob had a spy in his own camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't you? That is why you were watching last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. You thought that Ravnowickz and myself would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be holding midnight parley on how best to murder your</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend and turn the isleport over to our European</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Jerry's turn now to show signs of discomfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">191</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and embarrassment, but he rightly divined that silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was better than any answer he could make to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had so keenly analyzed his thoughts. He now</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to be alone for a time to think over the events</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the day, so he excused himself on the plea that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would keep watch for a time in case the fleet should</seg><seg type="columnLine">put in an appearance. Holden assured him that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">duplicate microphone buzzer was connected in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and would give them due warning of such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">event. But Jerry insisted that now the war was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">in earnest, they could rot exercise too great caution.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover Holden was much worn by the exciting events</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the day and needed rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the Palm Garden, Jerry selected a spot with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unobstructed view toward the East and made himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable in a steamer chair. The night was clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bracing but not cold. The next day would un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly witness operations on a larger scale and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed that if the allies should make a combined air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and naval attack, nothing short of a miracle could</seg><seg type="columnLine">save them. But he had that day witnessed a miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the destroying effect of the positive ray and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that he had yet to fathom the resources of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant scientific mind of Bob Holden. Their safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in a great measure in the fact that the destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion wrought that day was unknown to the European</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alliance. Would they expect some message from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces on the isleport that night? They undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">would. He thought of wheeling Holden out to the wire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less room, then he considered that he would not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Station Signal to call. Moreover there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">great risk of the allies detecting the ruse, inasmuch as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the operator at the other end would undoubtedly recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nize that Holden's sending was not that of Ravno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wickz or of any other operator that would be delegated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the work. On the whole, it were better to let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose that there was a mishap to the wireless send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. equipment. Let them suppose anything they wished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their imagination could hardly at the utmost, visualize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the completeness of their disaster, especially after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">message the spy had sent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally his thoughts wandered out over the varied</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiences of his wandering life. It had all been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious adventure, captivating to one of his tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. There had been enough of the valleys to enhance</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beauty of the sun-kissed peaks. He had peered into</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sorts of environs and lived under all sorts of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions, but he had lived for the sheer joy of living.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His paths had crossed and recrossed with those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, notably with those of Bob Holden and Kitty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cromwell, now to converge again upon this fabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis, the masterpiece of Holden's master mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had carried through the years the memories of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this adorable Irish lass, and now had found her again</seg><seg type="columnLine">after years of seeking. But he saw only too clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">how matters stood betwen her and his friend. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not intrude his own feelings to leave any pangs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of regret. They should never know how he felt toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Deep within himself, he felt the fitness of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two for each other, and he held some modest doubts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own ability to bring to her happiness in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure as he knew he would receive it. He was after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, only a vagabond. He had never concentrated on any</seg><seg type="columnLine">work such as Bob Holden had done. His art was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest achievement, and in that he felt that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have risen to far greater heights, had he been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a more earnest and consistent worker. He would see</seg><seg type="columnLine">this thing through, and if they came out of it un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scathed, would take up his pack again and carry on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This settled, he wrapped his blanket about him and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly to sleep, the sleep of his jungle days, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and beasts threatened from every quarter; sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">that left the ears attuned to the sounds of the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet he had learned thus, how to get the necessary rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and refreshment. He awoke with the first graying</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the eastern sky, harbinger of the day of destiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Battle of Atlantis</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MORNING dawned on the second day of what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be known in history as the Battle of At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis. Holden, although suffering intensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his wound, insisted on accompanying his two</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends to the circular room. While they were filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with anxiety for his welfare, there seemed to be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternative. The failure of any part of the compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated apparatus to function properly, would undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly cost them their lives as well as the loss of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause for which they fought. Accordingly, they ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceded to his demand and wheeled--him into the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servatory, where he directed Jerry Scott in the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the dome and the preparation of the apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wind had veered during the night to eastward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was now blowing almost exactly from the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from which the attacking forces would come. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was favorable to the trio of defense, as it placed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long side of the isleport with the circular room, broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side to the line of attack and made it less possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for any of the enemy to get around in the rear. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">isleport, not having been designed with a view to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">present militant purposes, had one vulnerable point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For, while an air attack from any quarter could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">repelled providing the planes maintained a reasonable</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitude, an attack from naval vessels from the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the isleport opposite to the observatory, must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved successful to the attacking forces. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to the fact that the deflection of the positive ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube to an angle necessary to meet such an attack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring the opposite side of the structure itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the path of the positive ray. Moreover, had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind been from a westerly direction, such a condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have undoubtedly proved disastrous, inasmuch</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the structure would then have intervened between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the positive ray tube and the approaching aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">armada. Holden had considered such a possibility and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the contingency arisen, he had decided to lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear side of the isleport by letting air out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottles on that side until the decks slanted down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward away from the circular room. If this provision</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not sufficiently remove the landing deck from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path of the ray, this deck together with the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories of the hotel would be cut in twain. In any</seg><seg type="columnLine">case he must take the hazard if the winds did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor. He was relieved therefore to find that nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">had contributed to the success of the cause he spon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sored. In the matter of an attack from the rear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he depended upon the enemy's ignorance of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions. The complete annihilation of their air fleets</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the previous day would prevent them from acquir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing any knowledge of the means of destruction em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployed against them, and in order to keep them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorance of this weakness he would engage the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacking forces while they were yet at sufficient dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance to prevent its discovery. The absence of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio message from their compatriots supposed now</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be occupying the isleport would, in all probability,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause them to exercise a greater degree of precaution</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their approach on this, the second day of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holden, from his wheel chair, interspersed his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structions to Jerry Scott, with periods of listening at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the microphone in order to catch the first sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching planes. Finally there came to him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint sounds of distant propellors, and in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">192</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty minutes they caught sight of the oncoming di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions. As they came into clearer view, it became</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent that they were coming in larger force than</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the previous day, and the watchers were soon able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to distinguish the outlines of three separate divisions</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the binoculars. The center division was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flanked on either side by a division flying some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance in the rear of the leading one. Each division</seg><seg type="columnLine">was arranged as on the previous day, in wedge shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation. Whether the absence of communications</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their comrades, had led to a suspicion that called</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a concerted movement, could only be conjectured</seg><seg type="columnLine">by those awaiting the attack. Certain it was, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, that this new front presented problems which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attack of the previous day had not previsioned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott and Miss Cromwell on the platform, swept sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sky with the glasses and kept Holden informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tactics employed by their adversaries, receiving</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him in turn directions for the conduct of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They must not let the enemy approach close enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come within effective range for the use of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine guns, yet it would be necessary to allow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading division to approach near enough to insure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that none of those in the rear could make their escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As on the previous day, they were flying at an alti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude of approximately three thousand feet. When they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached a distance of about eight miles from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isleport, Holden directed Scott to aim the tube at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear right hand division and lock in the moving device</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pedal. He must however, be ready to throw it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gear at any moment, as occasion might demand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In rapid succession there came the staccato of flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">and puff of smoke and the visual blanking of the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">where before a plane had been. In a little more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute the right hand division was swept away; but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the interval that this stupendous work was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress, consternation seized the other two divisions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The one on the left, right-faced hoping to elude this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious power, which in a moment of time had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed a division of fifty planes, but the leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">division came straight on spreading out however, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid if possible the destruction wrought by what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they must have supposed to be some new type of anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aircraft gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry Scott swung the tube to head off the flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left hand division, then as he stepped on the pedal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slowly moved the tube back toward the line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes now massed by their manuevre into what ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared from the side to be a compact group. As this</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of planes rushed into the path of the ray slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping to meet them, the destruction was appalling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The division was dissolved almost in an instant. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a denser cloud of smoke told where they had been.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Back swung the tube to the leading division, now less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than five miles distant, A rain of machine gun bullets</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell into the water a half mile short of the isleport.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scott stopped the leader. Then they heard the sing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whine of bullets through the air above them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly he whirled the tube from plane to plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing the pedal with each movement, and picking</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the foremost of the flyers. As the flashes followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other in rapid succession, confusion seized those</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were left; some sought refuge in higher altitudes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while others dived low or wheeled about to flee from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrath of that invisible power. In the confusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that resulted, all sense of order was lost. It became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a race of every man from the silent death that awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Plane crashed into plane, followed by bursts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame and the shooting of seething tongues of fire into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waters beneath. But Scott did not pause in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of destruction. With the precision of a pendu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lum, he swung the tube from group to group and plane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to plane, for none must escape to carry back the news.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the engagement, Kitty Cromwell stood be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him and kept up a rapid fire of reports to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impatient Holden in his chair below. The cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilled them to the marrow, the frost gathered on hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clothing and coated the metal parts of the struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture and apparatus, save those parts which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmed by the reaction taking place in the tube.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the first whistling of the bullets, Scott had mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned her to go below, but she did not heed him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept up her stream of reports to the wounded man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who could scarcely be restrained from mounting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform beside them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A flash," she said, "one gone, two, three, five; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">go so fast I cannot count them. Consternation has</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized them, they wheel and retreat, a whole division</seg><seg type="columnLine">has turned back. But we are following them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">division is wiped out." Then as the bullets whistled</seg><seg type="columnLine">around them "the leader is down. Two more are</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, some rise, others dive. Two crash and fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">in flames, now two more. They criss-cross. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel to go back. Then flash, flash, flash, little puffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke are all that remain of them. Now only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few scattered planes flying back. A flash, a puff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then another and another. All is over. Three di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions are wiped out." Then turning to Jerry Scott,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she extended her hand with, "Bravo, Jerry." But as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she turned, something over the horizon caught her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye and she picked up the binoculars. Not a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from her companions as she focussed them, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said: "Little wisps of smoke over the horizon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting toward us on the wind. I think it is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battleships that are coming."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scott looked and confirmed her opinion. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably between twenty-five and thirty miles away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tell me Bob," said Jerry, "what will be the effect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ray on a battleship?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One can never tell," said Holden, "until a thing is</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested and naturally, I have never made such a test.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	have turned steel, wood, coal, even a diamond into</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas, instantaneously. But that was at a short distance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably at a distance say of a hundred yards, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray would cut a ship in twain. But at a distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few miles, it should disintegrate the structure of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">battleship as readily as that of an airplane. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, we shall soon see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The band of smoke drifting across the horizon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadened out now and seemed to be coming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">three separate lines of ships. In half an hour their</seg><seg type="columnLine">masts and stacks could be plainly seen through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">binoculars. There was apparently a central line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">battleships flanked on either side by a line of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyers and light cruisers. Suddenly the entire fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to belch forth black smoke from their stacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, drifting down the wind in front of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly blotted them from view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think they could have seen the destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air fleets," queried Scott, "or could one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes have sent a message?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was hardly time to send any message," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied Holden, "but they may have seen some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashes in the air and are scenting danger. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will not know whether some of their planes have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a landing or not. They could easily reach us</seg><seg type="columnLine">now with their long range guns, but not knowing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate of their aircraft, they will hardly risk firing until</seg><seg type="columnLine">a closer view discloses the real situation. The posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of this isleport as a base, is absolutely necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the carrying out of their plans, and they will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">willingly take any steps that would result in its de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction: It will moreover, undoubtedly seem incred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible to them, that all their planes have been destroyed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">193</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As the ray tunneled Its way to the hull of the submarine a mountain of water and steam rose high Into tho sky, resembling as It rose, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">^rrithing, twisting body of a waterspout . . . Down where the waters bad been voided when the ray tore its gulf in the side of Neptune, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">»oa rushed back with the force of a tidal wave that shook the isleport. Then came the downpour like a cloudburst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the. fact that none have returned will be taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a clear indication that the isleport is in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession. The smoke screen will work to our ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage as well as theirs for it will soon shut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">islepoijt out from their view."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But when they shut off the screen," Scott replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"they will have the advantage, as they can fire on us</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as it clears enough to show them our position."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We will not wait for that. The positive ray will</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolve the screen just as readily as it docs any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of matter. Let them come on for half an hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That should bring them within eight miles of us at</seg><seg type="columnLine">most. Then dissolve the screen, by a light pressure on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pedal. It will require but very little power. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as you see a ship, sight the tube and give them</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full power. Pick the middle line of battleships</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, if you can see them, then the two lines of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyers to right and left. They will be sailing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight lines, one ship following another, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have fixed our position before laying down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen. That would be their safest plan if we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply using some new high powered explosive. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were aware of the means of destruction in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, they would spread out in a long line to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle us. In such a position it would be easy for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to destroy us before we could get any large</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of their ships. Their present tactics are such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to give us the advantage with the positive ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On and 011 floated the black menacing pall of smoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down the wind it came toward the isleport. It rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the tops of the waves like a Stygian cloud, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden in its depths, lay the power to destroy them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One shot from one of those great guns and all would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be over for them. Their safety lay in the enemy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorance of the true situation. But the battleships</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lost their eyes in the destruction of their airships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They might lay down a barrage in hopes that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">stray shell would strike home, but this they would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">do unless assured that none of their planes had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a landing on the isleport.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT the end of half an hour, the smoke screen was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so dense about them, that it was impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see more than fifty yards away and that, only during</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentary rifts in the pall. Scott, with watch in hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited the time for action. On the preappointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, he pressed the pedal lightly and as the smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen dissolved before the ray, it disclosed the hull</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a battle cruiser not more than seven.miles distant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing down under full head of steam straight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the isleporf, and behind it emerged into view ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">after ship in line. Even the light power used must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have generated intense heat in the path of the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">and upon the ships, for as the veil was torn aside, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shell screamed through the air above them and burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the water half a mile beyond them. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not an instant to spare and as Scott readjusted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">194</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sighting of the tube, Holden, who could no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrain himself, was on the platform beside them</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing his full weight upon the pedal. But rapid aa</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been their action, the pedal had scarcely started</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its descent, when another shell struck to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the isleport and a little short of it. But its burst-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was almost unnoticed for simultaneous with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a long drawn out roll as of the reverberations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of distant thunder. It was not the roll of explosions</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor yet the crashing of falling debris, but more like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roar of a series of conflagrations, the inrushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of infinite matter to fill the void where matter had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been dissolved. There was a seething and hissing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waters with clouds upon clouds of steam where,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment before, had been ten miles of ships, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride of Europe's mighty navies. Only the troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters now marked the place where they had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly floated, the exalted symbols of the power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">majesty of their nations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another instant and the two lines of destroyers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dissoU'ed into space. Just a long flash that</seg><seg type="columnLine">receded as it sped down the line like a devouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame, a seething of the waters and the long low</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumble as of distant thunder. Two or three shells had</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed harmlessly over their heads, fired by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyers in the interval of time that had elapsed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighting the tube, but there had been no time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gunners to find their range and the shells went</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide of their mark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Kitty Cromwell who sighted the periscope</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising from the water less than half a mile to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. She waited to speak no word, but quickly whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tube, deflecting it as she did so, and stepped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pedal. Neither of the trio were prepared for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupendous character of the results that followed. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">seething cauldron of superheated steam burst with</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcanic force, from the path of the ray where it met</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the ocean. As it tunneled its way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hull of the submarine, a mountain of water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam rose high into the sky, resembling as it rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the writhing, twisting body of a waterspout. Clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steam spread out over the heavens and a wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorching heat swept back upon them. Down where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waters had been voided when the ray tore its gulf</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the side of Neptune, the sea rushed back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the force of a tidal wave that rocked the isleport.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then came the downpour like a cloudburst. Tons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water poured over the decks and into the circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and the structure shook and trembled under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impact. Then suddenly the sun burst through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds of steam and mist and the isleport was enclosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a circle of rainbows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stood drenched to the skin, gazing at tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects of the stupendous phenomenon they had wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed. Far in the distance a few scattered cruisers</seg><seg type="columnLine">or destroyers which had left their line when the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of ships were destroyed, were fleeing under full</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed from the mysterious destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As they turned to look at each other, overawed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incredible cataclysm of the morning and rejoicing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their signal victory over the God of War, neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">one spoke but their hearts were filled with paeans of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanksgiving for their safe deliverance and the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liverance vouchsafed to millions of others throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. But as they looked into each other's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">brimming with tears, they saw Holden's body relax</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sink limply to the platform. Jerry Scott was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time to catch him. Gently he carried his pal down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps and placing him in the chair, rolled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to his apartment where they placed him in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed. Exhaustion, excitement, the heat and the drench-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing he had received, had brought on the collapse they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had feared, and fever followed quickly in its train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tidings</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMERICA heard the news of the battle through</seg><seg type="columnLine">London where it had been received from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Azores. Out of the great Armada consisting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourteen battle cruisers, twenty-six battleships, fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane mother ships, thirty-seven cruisers and forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">six destroyers, only seven destroyers and three cruisers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had returned to Fayal and more than four hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplanes had been destroyed. The submarines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remaining divisions of airplanes had been turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back by the fleeing destroyers. Only one super-sub</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken part in the attack and it was never heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nature of the forces which had wrought such</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholesale destruction, was wrapped in mystery. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigation soon revealed the fact that Bob Holden</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone to Isleport Number Two on the day preced-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the announcement of the purposes of the Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pean Alliance, and that he had not returned when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isleport was evacuated. Holden was well known in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government circles where he was looked upon as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstanding scientific genius of the world. The stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendous results could be accredited to no other agency</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was heralded by the press as the wizard who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had written "Finis" to the world's book of wars. Mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time no word had come from the isleport and doubts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were beginning to be entertained for his safety.

The great newspaper press-rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of New York and the Atlantic seaboard had the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bob Holden's life all set. Atlantis was treated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wealth of detail. Pictures of the Isleport and par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly of the mysterious circular room with its semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spherical dome had been obtained and used to decorate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front pages of the "Extras" which now awaited only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the message momentarily expected. The fastest oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ators were ready at the linotype machines and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">editorial offices and wireless rooms waited with bated</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath for the expected call. All wireless service had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been suspended, and the nation held itself in the tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence of expectancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the call agreed upon. It was "World</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peace." The operators galvanized into action.

Page after page</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell from the hands of the operators into the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of alert messengers who rushed them madly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">linotype rooms. Twenty minutes from the time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">message was ended, the first "Extras" were cried by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newsboys on the streets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "HOLDEN ALIVE BUT WOUNDED," ran the head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Newsboys were showered with bills that demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">no change, in return for the coveted copies. People</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered in crowds on the streets and talked excitedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to others whom they knew not. Social barriers and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prestige of position were all swept aside in the common</seg><seg type="columnLine">concern for the welfare of the man who had saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the horrors of war. Men mounted boxes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and read aloud to surrounding groups from the cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eted sheets, which the presses could not reel off fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to meet the demand. Here and there stood a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group with bared heads as one offered prayer.

Jerry was now with Bob Holden</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this was the sequel to that night.

There was a season of tumultuous rejoicing</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled with tears and prayers of thanksgiving, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the message finally came announcing that fie crisis</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed.

That Utopian peace which, cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies before, had inspired ancient thought with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its chimerical visions, had become the harbinger of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">universal concord among nations. To the trio marooned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this modern antitype of the ancient conceit, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come the counterpart of that which they had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world. They lived under the shadow of Holden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">illness but the shadow could not dim the halo of</seg><seg type="columnLine">service for one who had given so much to them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world. Kitty Cromwell was incessant in her at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentions by day and Jerry Scott spent the night hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the bed of his friend. But she was never far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and ever appeared at the slightest sound to</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothe him back to untroubled sleep. Her power in</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieting him did not pass unnoticed by Scott. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the background of the library, he noted the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">that suffused her cheeks when Holden mumbled in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coherent words from which he only caught distinctly</seg><seg type="columnLine">her first name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For days, Holden wandered in delirium, roaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly through the pleasant paths of the Palm Garden</seg><seg type="columnLine">he loved. Anon he talked of his boyhood days on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">New England farm, of its orchard and flowers, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mother, whose sainted image had left an undying</seg><seg type="columnLine">impress upon his youthful mind. For to one who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the normal walks of life, attunes his spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the natural and the beautiful, even the fancies of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">delirious brain will seldom depart therefrom. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were times when his mind, slipping into the more re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent pathways, drifted over troubled seas. At such</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments there arose visions of war and the ogre of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black-bearded stranger rose as a menace before him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but even in such moments, there was the struggle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">protect some one from harm, some one he loved. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the vision of the struggle merged into that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater conflict, he would say beneath his breath; "God</seg><seg type="columnLine">help the poor devils, but it is war.

The boy's private plunge had made him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good swimmer, and he was accustomed to artificially</seg><seg type="columnLine">salted water. For all her activity, Florence was barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">his equal in the game of tag which immediately started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither of the three maids dared venture into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, for fear of a wetting. One removed shoes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stockings, but she could not get near the frolicking pair;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they simply went out into deeper water. Presently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life-guard's boat came near, attracted by the laughter;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the maids hailed it, imperiously:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Make that boy get out of the water! He musn't play</seg><seg type="columnLine">in there! Hurry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guard's grin of enjoyment merely widened. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">c'n take care o' hisself, Lady! Don't need t' worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But--he musn't play there, I tell you! He might</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch -- something terrible, playing with -- strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">children!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The guard took one look at the superbly healthy face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the girl. "No danger, lady! I'll keep an eye on 'em!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three maids held a consultation. Immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them repaired to the bathhouse, from which, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course of time, she emerged clad in a bathing suit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert's eyes clouded with the prospect of an end to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the truth is that his teeth were chattering. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Florence's. But the maid made the mistake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">going into the surf, instead of simply commanding him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come out. He might have obeyed, cold as he was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead, she waded in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it was to be a chase! The boy warmed up. Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">Florence became re-animated as she discomfitted the maid</seg><seg type="columnLine">with well-aimed spurts of water, directed by sturdy</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms. Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed, and the maid</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unable to get nearer than three yards of her quarry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the truth is that, of all the people on the beach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the other two maids gave her the slightest sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the end, it was sheer exhaustion that drove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy to the sand. Immediately the reaction came; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad enough to creep, shivering, into the warm folds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bath-robe. But his spirit still glowed as it had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Good-bye!" shouted he to Florence. "I've had a jolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">good time, little girl! Haven't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bet! Coming down here again tomorrow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The boy looked up into the three stem, anxious faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him. The maids would have to make a strict ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counting to Daly Fosburgh. Bert shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think not." And then he was whisked away to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting limousine, at the same time that Florence's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother, by a crafty bit of maneuvering, captured and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enrobed her daughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT was in the morning. Neither child had any</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectation of ever seeing the other again. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, in the most natural manner in the world, Florence's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother and the three maids chose the same locality for</seg><seg type="columnLine">spending the afternoon. There was nothing remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the coincidence. Half the visitors at Santa Cruz</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the same procedure, putting in part of the day at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach and part at Veau de L'eau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This place is a portion of a famous Cliff Drive, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea has carved the cliffs into fantastic shapes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">designs, where a small marine museum had been erected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and where lovers of the ocean invariably repair when at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Santa Cruz. There is no beach; only the steady pound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the sculpturing waters, and the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The limousine arrived first. Keeping a firm grasp on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy, the nurse-maids visited all the usual points of</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest, carefully guarding against any sudden motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the boys part. In fact, one maid kept constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">between him and the cliff; she had not yet recovered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hie shock of his unprecedented actions in the forenoon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lad, without showing any signs of the spirit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">still burned within him, enjoyed the scenery as much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be expected under the circumstances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently the streetcar arrived, and Florence and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother got off. They wandered along the cliff, following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path that everybody treads at Veau de L'eau. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inevitable that, when it was time for the boy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return, he must encounter the girl and her mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This happened about five in the afternoon; an import-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant detail, for it marked the moment of low tide. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">water lay about thirty feet below the top of the cliff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the light of what happened, this cannot be too</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongly emphasized; the distance from water to land</seg><seg type="columnLine">was five times the height of a tall man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Being late in the day, there were few sight-seers</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, buch visitors as were on hand were scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">UP and down the cliff, paying scant attention to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. From time to time each gazed out over the ocean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without seeing any other craft than a distant coasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer. Earlier in the day, fishing boats would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been numerous. Now, scarcely unruffled by the breeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water was tenanted only by seaweed and the natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">denizens of the deep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'm tired," announced Bert, about five o'clock. "Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His word, in such matters, was law. Back the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded, and in less than a minute, encountered Flor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hello!" she shrilled, delighted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "How do you do?" he inquired, sedately. But the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to flash in his eyes again. One of the maids saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took hold of his other hand. He was a prisoner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What makes them so careful of you?" the girl wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know. Her mother, on seeing Bert, had deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned her back and walked away, her brow clouded</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Florence went on, relentlessly; "Are vou an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">va-lid ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NTH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">199</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy shook his head, mutely. The maid-in-chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered for him. And as she spoke, she took in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail of the girl's simple, inexpensive gown, the unpre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentious hat and sturdy shoes, the very evident lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">means in her whole appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is no invalid, little girl. But his health must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">very carefully guarded. Especially," with great em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phasis, "he must not associate with children below his</seg><seg type="columnLine">station in life!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was over Florence's head. Her only idea of a sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was a railroad depot. She replied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mamma says I musn't play with every old Tom, Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Harry, whatever that means; but I don't see any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing wrong in playing with this boy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you?" There is no snobbery like that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snobbish maid to snobbish people. "Well, I think dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferently! Keep away from him, please! Do not come</seg><seg type="columnLine">near!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl stood back, astounded, hurt, mystified. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned an incredulous gaze into the boy's troubled eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't you like me?" in an injured tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, but I do!" he flashed back, warmly. "I'm not</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry with you, little girl. I'm just"--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The- rest of his words were blown away by the wind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wind created by the peremptory jerking of his two cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors. No one seemed to notice Mrs. Neil, striding along</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of them, her head down, and her cheeks streaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with tears. Her little girl! Was the child, like herself, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways to face unhappiness because of the lack-of money?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or--what amounted to the same thing--was Florence to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffer like that at the hands of those who had money?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not right!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thus it happened that the girl was left alone for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute or two. She knew enough to keep away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extreme edge of the cliff. She ventured to within</seg><seg type="columnLine">what seemed a safe distance, and stared, still much hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">by what had happened, down into the idly moving waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the boy looked back. Next instant he all</seg><seg type="columnLine">but jerked loose from his captors. And he uttered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrill scream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cliff was crumbling beneath the girl. As Bert</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed, Florence leaped to one side; but she landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on another crumbling portion. And before the eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who were watching, the earth gave way and slid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a rumble, into the sea. The girl vanished from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next moment the two women who were holding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy found that they had their hands full. He screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and struggled, so that the third maid had to help to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold him. It was Florence's mother who, hearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream, ran up and peered ove the edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Florence was on the surface, sputtering dazedly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddling much less franticallly than one would suppose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Neil shouted, trying hard to keep her voice brave:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can't you {, t out?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Florence heard. She shook her head, and pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutely to the base of the cliff. It was far too precipitous</seg><seg type="columnLine">to afford a hand-grasp, much less a foot-hold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mother threw a swift glance around. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no boat nearer than miles. She had a fleeting fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">about airplanes and submarines; but there was no peri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope in sight, and nothii.g but seagulls in the air. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted again:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep away from the rocks! Hold your head up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep your hands and feet going! I'll get help!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Florence understood. She nodded, coolly, and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded to save her strength as far as possible, by putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth only enough exertion to keep afloat. Her nerve</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unshaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Neil ran, as fast as her skirts would let her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the boy and his maids, and towards the buildings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No outsiders seemed to have seen the disaster. And,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">even while clinging to the wildly thrashing boy, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three maids could see that the case was hopeless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The child could not possibly live in that sea until her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother brought help. Even though she escaped being</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed against the rocks she must surely become ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted and give up, long before she could be rescued.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The buildings were too far away. Even the boy seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to realize it, for, all of a sudden, he stopped his strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling and collapsed in a heap, at the same time bursting</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a fit of uncontrollable weeping. The women bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they looked up, for a moment neither could</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe her eyes. Each looked at the other, stupidly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then gazed down at the boy as though to learn whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, too, could see what they were seeing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they turned their eyes towards the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff again. At the same instant, the boy also looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. It was he who first found tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--why--where did-- Why, what does it mean I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then all four fell silent. There on the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff, exhausted, dripping, without the remotest idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of how she got there; thirty feet above the water where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been drowning only a moment before; above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest point that any wave had ever been known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach, lay Florence Neil, safe and sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">A CHAIN OF WONDERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE miraculous rescue of Florence Neil took place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in July, 1920. And since then the world has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated to a series of phenomena, each just as baff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling, just as inexplicable. Moreover, as they are ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined in their chronological order, these events are</seg><seg type="columnLine">found to be progressively more bewildering, progressively</seg><seg type="columnLine">more vast, until the final mystery leaves the mind fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned with the terrific marvel of it all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taken one by one, these miracles offer no solution that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is acceptable to the human intellect. It is only when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are grouped together, as the writer is now grouping</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, that they become understandable. Only by scour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the globe to get the facts--for these mysteries were</seg><seg type="columnLine">world-wide in their distribution--and by examining cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain occurrences of the past thirteen years, can the mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciate the stupendous Thing that rescued Florence</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neil, and that performed the other wonders about to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">related.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, once the list is read and all the facts in each case</seg><seg type="columnLine">become known, the explanation becomes almost ludi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crously simple. What had seemed miraculous, becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural, ordinary, understandable. One is no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">dubious as to whether the Nth Man was a creature or</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mind comes to see, after finishing the investiga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, that humans readily become accustomed to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is really astounding. The familiar example of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone will serve; today, we accept the wireless as</seg><seg type="columnLine">commonplace. We forget that it was once considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just so do we now accept the Nth Man.

His voice quavered pitifully in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well? Quick, man--did you find it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mate shook his head. "Brought up nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells," with a gruffness which he probably assumed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to conceal any pity for the sick man. "Shall I</seg><seg type="columnLine">try again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No." Captain Butler dropped back among his pil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows. "Not tonight." His voice was infinitely weary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mate lingered. "There's something else, sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">200</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">When the boys saw that the drag was a failure, they--■</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, sir, I only hope it doesn't mean mutiny!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Mutiny." The word did not seem to surprise the cap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tain of the little sloop. "Can't say--that I blame them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He thought deeply for a moment or so, then asked for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a finger of rye. He drank it, and in a minute felt strong</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enough to talk. He knew that the liquor would cost him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dear, a little later, but he could only hope that the invest-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment would pay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Payson--you understand what this expedition means.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't you think"--earnestly--"that you could make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys comprehend?

Couldn't you make them see it the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Again the mate shook his head. "I've done too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking already, sir. The've got so they won't pay any</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to me unless I threaten punishment. They--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've spoiled them, sir, by arguing with them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No, you haven't." Anyone could see that these two</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not born-and-bred sea-faring men, but gentlemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced out of milder walks of life into one for which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were never intended. "No, Payson. I wouldn't have it</seg><seg type="columnLine">any different."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He took a second drink of the liquor. "Help me into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chair," he requested, rather than ordered. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to take a chance with them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The mate complied in silence. Within a minute the sick</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man was facing his crew, a motley dozen, picked up at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Colon two months previous. The mate had rounded up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">everybody, including the cook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Men," began the captain, without delay, "you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess why I've come out here. I'm taking a big chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my hip in such bad shape; but I've tried to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself in your place, and I know that I'd want the facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight from the boss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This treasure that we're after--it's just as the mate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has told you. It was lost about three centuries ago, from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a Spanish pirate, the Cristobel. This sloop was named</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">after her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But our work is not at all piratical. We are here to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">recover that treasure, which is in the shape of a single</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">immense 'nugget'--or rather, a chunk of quartz, shot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through and through with virgin gold. Its history is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">uncertain, but it probably originated in Australia. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the wreck, the data as to its location was handed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down from generation to generation until, finally, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came into the possession of a man with money enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to get results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That man is--myself. As for this sloop, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment, it represents all that I have in the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If this expedition fails, I am a ruined man, and must</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back to my wife and children to start life all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But, if success comes, I, and you just as truly, will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be more or less wealthy.

There was a manly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring in the sick man's voice that carried conviction to</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than half his hearers. A slight murmur of approval</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose, quickly checked as a wiry, furtive-eyed Portugese</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged forward and spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We know, senor capitan.

No find</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hotting!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a supreme effort. His vocabulary was limited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He slid back hurriedly behind his fellows, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid he would be overwhelmed by the applause. It did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doe3 anybody else think the same way Manuel does?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yis!" A powerful Irishman, the only man of his race</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the craft, strode forward. He threw a scornful</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at the group which had murmured approval of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain. "Oi t'ink it's a dom shame, sor! Ye've kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">us here, goin' on two months, wit' no gold to show fer it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'Tis toime we pulled up an' cleared out, sor!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Have you any personal reason for this opinion, Mike?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yis!" The Celt was not to be daunted by the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">words the captain had used. "Them noospapers we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">from th' Dago tramp steamer, said they was offerin' tin</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucks a day for longshoremen at Noo York! That's bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter'n we be doin' here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To this, there was a rumble of agreement from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other half of the crew. And of those who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly before, more than one began to look doubtful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boys--there's more to this than you think." Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Butler had made up his mind to a bold move. "I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take you into my confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This money--assuming that we succeed--is going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplish something more than make us rich. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to do the world a great good. And I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you, right now--even Payson doesn't know this--</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly what I intend to do with the bulk of my share.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "To begin with you've been calling me 'Captain Butler.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is not my real name." He paused to let this take</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect. "I merely adopted the name because it sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">more impressive than my real name, which is Jones, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I have been, all my life, until a few months ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed as a butler, in the States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For almost twenty years I was a butler, men. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked for half a dozen of the foremost families of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. And during that time I learned to have an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense amount of sympathy for people of my own class.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I found that the average servant is to be pitied, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">despised, men. Most servants are forced by poverty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept such work. Few actually prefer to wait hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot on someone else. It isn't natural.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I'm going to take my share and found a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">home for servant's children. I am planning to care for</seg><seg type="columnLine">about forty. The idea is to teach the poor kids some</seg><seg type="columnLine">useful trade or other occupation, so that they will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be forced into waiting on other people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what I'm going to do with mine, boys! It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big work, and something to be proud of when I'm an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "As for what you do with yours, I don't care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's your business. But at least we understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other, now; and I think you'll stick by me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">match my patience with yours. How about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had there been any downright hard feelings among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men, or any spirit small enough to take advantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man in the captain's position, the affair might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned out differently. But the captain had chosen his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, in the first place, with an unusual amount of shrewd</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychological guidance. And he had taken first-rate care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them; he, of the whole ship, had been ill. From grub</seg><seg type="columnLine">to phonograph, they had no cause for complaint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE crisis passed. Another month went by, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically no change in the situation. The dragging</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought no results at all; and day after day the sailors'</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience slowly oozed away. The captain's condition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which ought to have become improved, remained the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">as before. A little encouragement, and he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered at once; disappointment kept him down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The end came on the thirty-second day after the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain's burst of confidence. It came, as before, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">final haul of the day had proven barren.

"We mane</seg><seg type="columnLine">no harm to ye; none at all, sor!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've just come to tell ye that we quit; no more!</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Tis no mutiny, sor; we're not that kind.

We jist refuse to stay here anither day, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">thot's an end to it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain looked steadily into their eyes. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were, as he had judged before, of the right sort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had nothing to fear from them, so long as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonable. And he sighed as he admitted, to himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at least he must in justice give in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right, Mike. Go--back to your quarters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We sail--when the wind comes up, at midnight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men filed silently out. They knew that their stipu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated thirty-a-month would be forthcoming when Panama</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reached, and that they could ask nothing further.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Payson followed them, and softly closed the door. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">one knew what sprang to the captain's eyes the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was left alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That final evening off the coast of Chile, saw the crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their hammocks at the usual hour. Five bells found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship perfectly quiet, save for the soft lap of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific against the hull, the gentle slapping of lines as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sloop swayed at anchor, and the constant, complaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeak of wood against wood. Except for the men on</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch, all were asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of those awake, one was the Irishman. The other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">name, Nelson, is important because it typifies the kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a character who was the chief witness to the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the "Colossal Mysteries". Nelson, a stolid, unimagin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ative Swede, a total abstainer, whose veracity was pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verbial aboard the ship, stood at the wheel. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prow stood Mike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By six bells, the breeze had become nearly strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to work with. Mike, however, had orders to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">until midnight; and now, with a return to civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">so near, he could afford to be patient. He fell to watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the sway of the vessel, speculating on the angle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she leaned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, without any apparent cause, the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">careened far over towards the shore. Immediately, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, she righted herself, or nearly righted herself; yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike fancied that she remained with a decided shore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward list. It was odd. Mike called, in a low tone, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swede:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did ye notice thot, Nels?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did Ay notice watt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Th' ship: how she tilted, jist now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yah; Ay notice him, oil right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What d'ye make of it, Nels?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Swede, as always when he did not know how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, made no reply at all. Silence once more settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the sloop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, it is at this point that we have to rely largely</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon wfcat Nelson told. Apparently Mike's thoughts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eyes, were elsewhere at the moment. This is queer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he afterwards declared that he had been eyeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waist of the ship more or less, wondering what could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have caused that cant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Nels Nelson was sure, absolutely sure on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">point: That, within a space of one minute, he gave two</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances towards the waist of the ship. In the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance, he was certain, he saw nothing out the way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing was there save the white surfaces of the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls and roof, the aft hatch, and the usual parapher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nalia in the stern. On his second glance, less than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute later, he saw--It.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mike," called he, softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whot is it?" just as softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ay tank you batter wake de captain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mike was electrified. He knew the Swede pretty well;</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing short of something phenomenal could have roused</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nels to that extent. In seven steps, Mike, racing along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seaward side of the deck, reached the steersman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, Swede?" excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nelson merely nodded in the direction of the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Irishman looked, and as his eyes caught sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what lay on the shore-ward side of the deck, between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail and the cabin, he felt his hair slowly rising beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An instant's hesitation, and he darted below. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">not one minute elapsed before both captain and mate, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">former well bundled up and the latter bearing a powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">acetylene lantern, emerged on the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Mike?" constrainedly, from the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Irishman silently took the lantern, and turned it</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the deck beside the cabin. There stood an enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous object, like a huge boulder. Two minutes before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had not been there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A swift examination, and the truth was known. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath all its coating of ocean growths, was revealed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-lost "nugget" of the old Cristobel. It was that, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing less.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But how did it get there? Water was dripping from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone, forming a large pool on the deck. On the rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more water, and seaweed and bits of broken shells.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the hull itself was a large wet area, and more shells.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As for the surrounding waves, a thorough search showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How did the stone get there?

And, whereas</seg><seg type="columnLine">the affair off the coast of Chile took place in December--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is to say, summer, south of the equator--of 1922,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this next event occurred nearly two years later, the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Thanksgiving, in the northern part of Africa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The account begins with a very commonplace matter:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two American tourists, about five o'clock in the evening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into a waiting automobile in front of a hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Cairo. One Arab, kneeling on the running board,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied them. The younger American himself drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Little was said as the car passed through the magnifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent avenues of the modern part of the city. Presently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, an older part of the capital was reached, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both visitors became interested enough in the ever-chang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, yet changeless hordes of unfathomable Orientals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not until the car had crossed the Nile and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching the railroad at the west, that the older</seg><seg type="columnLine">American spoke anything that called for a reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was just thinking, Redpath," with a sudden chuckle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that these Arabs we're passing would've been pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly shocked, twenty years ago, to see a sight like us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean, our car." Redpath slowed the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drove carefully alongside the road, as they overtook</seg><seg type="columnLine">and passed a caravan of camels, desert-bound. "I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand that the first of these 'devil wagons' was pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly bunged up, Shaw. The Arabs stoned the driver."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But now, they're used to it," commented Shaw. "Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I've always held. People can get used to anything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they've got to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And yet, there's a limit." Redpath seemed, for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his youthfulness--or, shall we say, because of it?--more</seg><seg type="columnLine">202</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest and thoughtful than his elderly acquaintance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's some things that won't stand for change.

By this time an unob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed view of the first pyramid was to be had. "Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing's got to change. Change is the only thing that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">permanent. Change!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't say so. How about that?" And Redpath</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the great Egyptian monument just ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shaw waved a hand, airily. "That? A mere pimple</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the face of time! Another few seconds out of eter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity, and"--he puffed a cloud of smoke from his cigar--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"gone, like that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Redpath made no comment for a while, being too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied with the problem of driving. He wasn't accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed to a roadway in such fearful condition. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the topic of Change versus Changelessness was not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vived until about three hours later, when the Americans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">camped for the night near the two pyramids which</seg><seg type="columnLine">flanked the Sphinx, sat down for a final smoke following</seg><seg type="columnLine">their supper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This Arab," commented Redpath, "is a dandy. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">really managed to keep all the other grafters away. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the right hunch, Shaw, about paying him five in ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance and holding up the other five until we get back."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, and I generally have the right hunch, too, young</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow!" But there was nothing patronizing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaw's manner. No one would have guessed that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was twenty years difference in their ages. "I was right</seg><seg type="columnLine">about getting here in the evening, so's to view the monu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments by the morning sun.

These</seg><seg type="columnLine">bags make the water taste second-hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A short silence, broken only by the stertorous breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of their Arab, who had gone to sleep. His head was</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully sheltered from the moon's rays. Redpath had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an idea, and turned the rays of their portable search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light upon the snoring mound, and waited. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Arab turned over, uneasily, and without half awaken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, he twisted about until he got his head on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the packing-case that had sheltered him from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See that?" chuckled Redpath. "Subconsciously, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed that the moon has moved in the sky. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is afraid to sleep with his head exposed to it!" A pause</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thoughtfulness, then: "I wonder if that isn't a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">good argument?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In favor of Changelessness. This fellow's subcon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious mind. He has the same subconscious mentality</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his ancestors had, thousands of years ago!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pretty fair," admitted Shaw. "Pretty fair; no use</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking, it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet, young fellow, how long d'you suppose this</seg><seg type="columnLine">"moon-mad notion of his'd last, if something should hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen to the moon? Suppose a comet should smash the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, for instance. Wouldn't his subconscious change?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But nothing's going to happen to the moon!" Red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">path looked as though slightly shocked. He will be bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter understood when it is said that, like many other young</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of wealth in America, his education, while very</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, was not at all broad. In short, extremely conserva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The moon is there to stay!" he insisted. "So is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, the stars, and everything else in the universe!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the details change! The big facts, the big princi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ples, never change!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Redpath wisely shook his head, an assured smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing about the corners of his mouth. He was staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Sphinx as he added: "No; when it comes to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great principles of life, Shaw, my mind is as changeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">as--that Sphinx!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shaw peered through the darkness towards the great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion-bodied head. "That! Why--she's changing all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, Redpath!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Sphinx? Change? Where do you get that stuff?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, perhaps you're thinking something like this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Redpath: 'Changeless as the Sphinx'. But it's bunk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">young fellow; bunk; Besides, that isn't the correct</seg><seg type="columnLine">quotation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Redpath, that stone is very slowly disintegrating;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the time's coming when it'll go back to the sands it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That Sphinx," deliberately, aggressively, "will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">right where it is now, until the end of time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, don't be so darned stubborn! You know better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that, Redpath. Why, the blamed thing changes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with every sandstorm; it changes with every cold snap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's changing every day; every night!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pure, unadulterated nonsense," calmly lighting a fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is that so!" Shaw grabbed the storage battery, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed the searchlight to the other. "Grab this, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">come on. We'll have a look at her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was beginning to get a little cool, and both men</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcomed the exercise. A vigorous trudging through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand, and presently the pair were standing in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, rock-hewn monument of the ancient Egyptian</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a while, like all who look upon the enormous face</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time, both men remained silent. Despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that they were Americans, neither made any</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations as to the weight of the rock, or the years</seg><seg type="columnLine">that must have been spent in sculpturing that tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">head out of the living stone. Each remembered having</seg><seg type="columnLine">read that it stood more than sixty feet high, a close rival</seg><seg type="columnLine">in size to the head of the Statue of Liberty. The flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rays of the searchlight somehow made the figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem too small. Truly, it was a marvel that the ancients</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have achieved such a thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, you observe its nose?" at last, from Shaw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Or rather, the place where the nose used to be. Gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, for hundreds of years. What've you got to say for</seg><seg type="columnLine">changelessness, now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just as much as ever," stolidly. "How do we know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this thing was made with a nose? Perhaps it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed just as we see it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Without a nose!" Shaw was staggered, more with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coolness with which the idea was stated, than with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the notion itself. "Well, it ain't impossible." He led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way closer. "Better take a look at the mouth, Red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">path."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light plainly revealed the effects of constant ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posure to the storms of the desert--storms and the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">onslaughts from Arabian spears. The rock was fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">eaten away from the upper lip. Grinding and polishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of the stone, the sand had made unmistakable</seg><seg type="columnLine">inroads upon the features. But Redpath would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May have been built that way," he insisted. "Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, it doesn't seem reasonable to suppose that it was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll admit that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I'm dead sure you go too far, Shaw, when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim that the Sphinx is changing--every day, I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you said."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bit of it," sturdily. "It's changing right now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before your eyes! Fact. Only, it's too minute for us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Before our eyes! You've got to show me," with</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritating nonchalance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaw became more than slightly excited. "See here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're too all-fired stubborn for any use! You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty well I'm right. You're just holding out because--n</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll bet you anything you like," interrupted the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NTH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">203</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">aggravatingly, "that this Sphinx does not change in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slightest, overnight! I'll leave it to any scientist! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't change!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It does!" flatly. "And I'll gamble on it with anybody!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How much?" insolently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Any--amount--you damned--" Shaw stopped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of his emphatic reply. His face changed; an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea had struck him. And he smiled grimly as he went on:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"See here, young fellow! I don't like to bet money on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sure thing like this. It's like taking money from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby. I know I'm right and you'll just throw your</seg><seg type="columnLine">money away. I won't bet--money!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," with a sneer. "If you haven't got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage, why--''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I say, I won't bet for money." There was a new,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steely look in Shaw's eyes, now. "But I'll put up</seg><seg type="columnLine">another kind of a wager, and see if you're man enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take me up!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The proposition is this, Redpath: This Sphinx</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes a little bit, each and every night. We'll leave it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to a vote of two out of three scientists. How's that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right. But what's the bet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Punishment, for whoever loses. I'm so dead sure I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, I'm willing--if I lose--to come back here to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sphinx and climb to the top, and kiss the rock! We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, I'm to make a pilgrimage here every ten years, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do the same thing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fair enough. What about me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you lose--if we learn that the old girl really does</seg><seg type="columnLine">change overnight--then, since you're so infernally sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your stand, you're to do this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got to change your clothes six times a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the next six months!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Redpath gravely considered. "For six months?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a day less!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right! I'll take you up on that, Shaw!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men shook hands. Then, feeling rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashamed, perhaps, they stood for some time playing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlight over the great countenance, and studying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baffling expression of its weather-beaten features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they returned to camp, Redpath switched off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light; they strode through the sand for some minutes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, enjoying the effects of the moonlight, upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert. Queer shadows loomed from behind sand heaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and changed the landscape into a gray and black one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of possibilities for those who are susceptible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancies. Redpath was practical, but Shaw had an imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ination. And it was he, who, shortly before reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, stopped suddenly and uttered an odd exclamation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Redpath! Did you see that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" curiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That pyramid! I thought it--moved!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Redpath laughed, maliciously. "Moved! That pyra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid? Sure it didn't stand on its head. Shaw?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The older man had recovered from his surprise, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now looked very much abashed. He took out a handker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, and wiped his forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My eyes, I guess. Might have been a camel, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">around behind the thing. Fooled me, all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Redpath noticed that his companion cast more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than one mystified glance at the huge heap of rock be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore reaching the camp. And, the last thing before</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting under the blankets, Shaw raised his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked long and earnestly at the object which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By George," he muttered, mainly to himself. "I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have sworn that I saw something move, over there!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something as big as the pyramid, or I'll eat my hat!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the unaccustomed exercise had the usual effect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within a very few minutes both men were emulating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arab's example. As to whether they, like he, slept audibly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no evidence one way or the other. The auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobile was the only witness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As afterwards told by Redpath and Shaw, the hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they were awakened was in the neighborhood of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three o'clock, and the moon had set. Each described the</seg><seg type="columnLine">event 111 the same language: a mild earthquake, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much prolonged, and accompanied by a fitful breeze. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not awaken the Arab. He may have been accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed to earthquakes. But both Americans, after look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at their watches, lay for several minutes experiencing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sensation. They were not frightened; they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not near anything that could fall on them. Each set it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in his memory as an uncommon, but not unpleasant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within half an hour the camp was again silent. Pitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, relieved only by star-light, once more settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the place. Once there was a subdued crackle or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two from the auto, as pieces of metal reacted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change of temperature. That, together with the ticking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of watches and the sound of three men breathing, was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that broke the stillness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As might be supposed, it was the Arab who first awoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning. The sun was yet an hour from rising,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was fairly light already. And the first the Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans knew of it, there came the voice of the Arab, flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his carpet, his face towards Mecca, as he repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unintelligible lingo which he believed would save his</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul. The Americans listened without moving their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads. Tn a moment, the Arab was done; he got up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rolled his carpet. Next second he turned around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked towards the west; and his voice broke into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrified shriek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Allah is great! Great is Allah, and Mohammed is</seg><seg type="columnLine">his only Prophet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And down he fell upon his knees, gibbering. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Americans sprang to their feet, startled, looking at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another in amazement. Then, their gazes turned towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west, and they saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The head of the Sphinx was--gone! Gone completely;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it looked as though it had been snapped off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That earthquake?" breathed Shaw, his flesh creeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Redpath stood as though petrified. His gaze wand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, shakily, to one side. And he gave a gasp of awe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You win!" he whispered, and pointed a trembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On top of the nearest pyramid, securely planted upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flat space at the very summit, stood the missing</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the Egyptian Sphinx.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Amazing Theft</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN collecting the data which is here presented, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">writer has culled, from the long list of unaccountable</seg><seg type="columnLine">events that were attributed to the Nth Man, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient to make a chain strong enough to sustain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding truth. No attempt has been made to even</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint at the many peculiar incidents which a stricter</seg><seg type="columnLine">historian would include. Besides, some of these incidents</seg><seg type="columnLine">are doubtful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For instance, the matter of hanging black crepe on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Statue of Liberty, on the night of July Fourth, 1926:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why should people blame this on the Nth Man? Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">any passing helicopter, manned by a daring anarchist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have committed this sardonic piece of sacrilege.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mere fact that the crepe was unusual material, after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards traced to Thibet, does not change the situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stunt certainly was not characteristic of It.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So one had better follow the simple chain here pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented. This brings the series to 1927, early in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring; March 28, to be exact. And the location of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering affair was staid, matter-of-fact Europe, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing miraculous had happened for centuries. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, whereas the preceding mysteries had had outdoor</seg><seg type="columnLine">settings, this took place under a roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">204</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This roof covered a large, three-story structure in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city of Hamburg, Germany. The building, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet square and soundly built of steel and stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">housed the bank known to the world as the Zollverein</seg><seg type="columnLine">Internationale. And, although it has nothing to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter, it may be mentioned that the roof was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of very fine Spanish tiling, for the bank was designed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a modified Mission style. Hamburg took especial pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On the evening previous to the day in question, a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of peculiar personality left a certain hotel about six</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks from the bank, and quietly strode down the street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It being almost midnight, the man was given a quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny by two or three policemen, each of whom al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him to pass without question, after noting his dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nified bearing and the obvious elegance of his attire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seemingly, a rich American tourist, out . for a stroll</seg><seg type="columnLine">before turning in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon reaching the bridge over the Binnenalster, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger paused and leaned on the railing, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in thought. One policeman passed him there. Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately afterwards, the stranger sauntered on, shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">arriving opposite the Zollverein Internationale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There he paused and deliberately surveyed the struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. Two witnesses corroborate one another in this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stranger remained nearly two minutes, carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking in every detail of the bank, especially the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">grill work which protected the windows nearest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaults.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then he passed on. Reaching the next corner, he dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, taking a turn to the right. This should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him back to the river, further upstream; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact he was later seen, three blocks away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, studying the waters from the railing of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge. This time, when he moved on, he walked in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the hotel from which he had come; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never reached the place. He was never seen again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only within the last few years has the truth about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stranger become known. His disappearance, it seems,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a perfectly natural thing, under the circumstances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For, curious though it may seem, this stranger was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the extraordinary affair of the Zollverein Inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nationale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon leaving the bridge upstream from the bank (we</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, now) the stranger strolled for a short distance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of his hotel. Then, reaching a street which</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall here be nameless, he turned to his left; and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking a trifle over two blocks, he came to an abrupt</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt in front of a quiet, unpretentious residence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This house, by reason of its standing on a slight ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vation, overlooked a good deal of the city. And, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreground of its view, lay the dim white walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger cast a keen glance in each direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before running up the steps. Then, he gave an unusually</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ring to the bell, followed by two more, very short</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crisp. Almost instantly the door opened. Like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash he darted in; and the door was as swiftly closed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All this, without a light being shown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Once inside, however, the stranger quietly produced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, electric light, which he calmly switched on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then handed to the person who had opened the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This person, a woman, turned the light full in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger's face; and for ten or more seconds subjected</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to a silent, but thorough scrutiny, during which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">referred several times to three photographs which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">held in one hand. In the end she seemed satisfied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," said she, in German; and led the way up an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old-fashioned staircase. The man followed, showing no</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise when, after reaching the top of the stairs, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman led him down a short corridor and then began</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounting another flight. In all this, no light was used</seg><seg type="columnLine">other than that from the little lamp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Shortly, the two reached a door on the third floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The woman stood aside for the man to enter; and, keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his hands conspicuously in his side pockets, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger stepped in. The woman followed, and closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and locked the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Next moment she pressed a button, and the room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooded with a curious radiance. It was a deep, red</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, which came from concealed sources. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man gave a startled exclamation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Fraulein! You should have pulled the curtains!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The woman smiled. It was a slow, patient smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">queerly distorted by the odd lighting effect. She shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Nein, mein herr. The window glass is green in color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And, as you know, red light cannot pass green glass."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The man made a quick gesture. "Pardon me. I might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have known that you would be careful, fraulein." He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">looked around, and selected a straight-backed chair of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some old Bavarian design. He paid no attention to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other furnishings of the room, which might be described</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as a combination of library and sewing-room. "Your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">credentials, please, fraulein."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman silently drew, from her bosom, a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelope. This she handed, to the American, who care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully examined the photographs and other data he found.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently he was satisfied, for he returned everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a curt nod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was perhaps forty. The woman noted heavy, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined lines about his mouth, and a coldly calculating</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression in his eyes. A man to be reckoned with,</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We may as well come right down to business," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman, her voice as well as her appearance typifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that is generally associated with the autocratic classes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Germany. "You have come, I understand, to collabo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate with me in a rather extraordinary enterprise. Sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose we understand one another perfectly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Very well," agreed the American. "To put it in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, fraulein, I have been commissioned by a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">American of vast wealth, to bring about certain changes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Europe. These changes, naturally, are such as will</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit my client. You see, I am being quite frank."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is much the best way, mein herr. Now--what</seg><seg type="columnLine">results do you wish to secure?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The overthrow of every republic in Europe!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And--why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That is my client's affair!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The woman nodded slowly. "Quite so. There remains</seg><seg type="columnLine">just one point: How do you intend to go about it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are two methods, fraulein. One is to induce"--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he used the word with sarcastic significance--"induce</seg><seg type="columnLine">various officials in these republics to adopt policies more</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my client's liking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I am afraid," softly, "that it is far too late to talk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of such a method. Practically all these officials are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">honest, strange though that may seem." She paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I see from your face that you are already satisfied on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this score."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The American cleared his throat. "I only mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the method because I was instructed to do so. You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, fraulein, that it will not work?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Quite."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No other way than your way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "None."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "State it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE woman stepped to a table which stood in the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of the room. From a drawer she produced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large tape-wound envelope.

"This is the right dope!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I beg pardon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"The fault was mine," resumed the German.

"A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few swift blows, and--democracy shall end!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The American leaped to his feet. "By Jove!" in un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mistakable delight. He began to pace the room. From</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time to time he stopped to re-read some part of the plan,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and to ask eager questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"This overlooks nothing, fraulein?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing!

The people have always bad a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soft spot for royalty in their hearts. All that is needed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is--money!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hill came up short, and suddenly wheeled upon the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman. His brows narrowed with suspicion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"All very well, fraulein! And yet, how comes it that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you, an anarchist, are thus plotting to place monarchy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back on the throne again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She laughed, a short and disagreeable laugh, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">showed an entirely new side to her character. "I really</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">did not think you were so dense as that, Herr Hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There are anarchists, and there are anarchists.

Even your anarchists--in America?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"All who really count, mein herr. Their function is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to stir up violence, so as to give your autocrats an ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cuse to persecute the true reformers. Surely, you knew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of this before!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," dubiously. "But I never could believe it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fraulein. In America, we are apt to take things for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">granted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He fingered the documents once more. Apparently he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">made up his mind at that instant, for he turned, abruptly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We shall call it a bargain, fraulein. The money shall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be yours!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The woman's eyes glowed. "Herr Hill--you are will-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing that my organization shall do this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Fraulein, the matter was left entirely to my discre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion. The man who is backing me, gave me instruc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions to go ahead if I felt satisfied that the plan would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">succeed. And--I am satisfied!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Good!" She swept to her feet. "When can we pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ceed, mein herr?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"At once! This very night!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The woman stopped short. "You mean--the money is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">already--at our disposal?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He nodded. "Enough and to spare, fraulein!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But" -- She seemed bewildered. "Surely, you can-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not have so much money in Hamburg, mein herr!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He chuckled, dryly. "You do not understand Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can methods, fraulein. The cash arrived this afternoon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretly, by a fleet of submarines. It was unloaded at</seg><seg type="columnLine">an underwater dock, and conveyed by tunnel to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman reached out a hand, as though to steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself. "You have it all?" she whispered. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">American gold--for which our Cause has prayed all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">years?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enough to wipe out your national debt!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman recovered herself. "Pardon," she smiled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little shakily. "But it is very--very unnerving, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">one has waited so long. Good news--may be hardest to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are willing, then, that I shall summon the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittee?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," curtly. "I am instructed to make ternis</seg><seg type="columnLine">only with the properly accredited officers of your or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganization."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"And--when?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right now, fraulein!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She picked up a telephone, and gave a number. Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently she was speaking, in a guarded voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Franz--this is Bertha. The eagle is ready for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast. Bring the waiters. Do you--understand?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She replaced the instrument. "It is done, Herr Hill."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her face was wreathed in smiles, now. "You shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet our executives inside the next half hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman's nerves demanded action. She began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk excitedly about the room, just as the American had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done a short while before. And now it was she who</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know not what this means to us--to me, Herr</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hill! It means release from that odious social democ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">racy. It means that we, who are entitled to the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">places in the scheme of things, shall once more come</seg><seg type="columnLine">into our own!" She laughed, almost girlishly. "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the money, Herr Hill? Which bank?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strode to the window, and peered through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass in the direction of the Zollverien Internationale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Put out the light, fraulein," said he. "You shall see for</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She extinguished the red light, and started towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the American's side. At the same instant, there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar sound from without. It was a mumbling roar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that of a distant surf. Simultaneously the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled and shook, as though in the grip of an earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quake. It was over in a moment or so; everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet and still inside two minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was that?" sharply, from the woman. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">she darted to the window, where the American, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to open the window, was leaning half out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room in the intensity of his gazing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman caught his shoulder, and held him fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look out!" she whispered. "You'll be seen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, on the instant, the American gave a queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation, as of fear. He caught a hand to his throat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tottered, and collapsed. The German woman bent over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His heart had failed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman straightened. She turned at once to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. What had caused the tragedy? She stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all her eyes in the direction the American had gazed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the spot where the great bank had stood, a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bank was no longer there. It had disappeared as</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely as though swept from the face of the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing was left save the foundation walls and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellar; money, watchmen, walls and roof, had vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sight of man. A small crowd of gaping citi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zens was already collecting. But the bank--was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">206</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the American, Hill, he was never heard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He was buried by the anarchists, who saw no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other way of escaping publicity and persecution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And to this day, not the slightest trace has ever been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found of the building or the contents of the Zollverein</seg><seg type="columnLine">Internationale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Where Nothing Grew Before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO far, the performances of the Nth Man have lacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quality of constructiveness. That is to say, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracles have never been more than corrective, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their effects upon man. In fact, some of the incidents</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been almost mischievous in their nature; the stunts</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear many of the earmarks of youthful destructiveness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the next mystery--the last but one before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupendous climax to the series--shows a decided change</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the better in the mentality of its perpetrator. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petrator, however, is a hard name for the unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benevolence which resurrected a dead continent. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a hundred million people in this world who are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically, worshippers at the shrine of the Nth Man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of what was done for them on the seventeenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of December, 1928.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The circumstances will be easily understood by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have passed through an East Indian hurricane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Typhoons, the natives call these storms; the name is of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small consequence. Everyone knows that the stoutest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ships never deliberately face one of them. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric freighter, Mammoth III, which sailed from Van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couver on the tenth of that month, was commanded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">as cautious a sailor as ever handled a crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But not even Captain McTavish could know, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed the Marshall Islands west-bound, that a hurri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cane was raging with such violence, only a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles ahead, that both of the Philippine weather-planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been put entirely out of commission by the sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the onslaught; so that some six or seven freight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, like the Mammoth III, were steadily and confidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">forging ahead into an area of extreme danger. Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tavish only knew that he was making good time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The storm struck when the ship was yet a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from New Guinea. There was, of course, the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">low-pressure warning; but it gave the captain scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">more time than to realize that lie could not hope to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gilolo Passage. Not in such a sea; the wind, too, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure to become a thing to run away from, not to bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And an hour later saw the ship, her decks as bare as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plate, scuttling before a wind that mocks all descrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. McTavish was glad that he had a freighter; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old days, before aircraft absorbed all passenger traf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fic, the steamer might have carried a thousand passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers, each of them an enormous problem in the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such a turmoil. But the two dozen people aboard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge freighter were sea-farers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A rare experience, captain," came a hail from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless room, as McTavish passed beneath the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion-way. It was the voice of young Sanson, the day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift radio man. "Picked up five others, so far; all in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same fix!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McTavish inwardly marvelled that Sanson's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">could carry above the racket. He could not know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radio man had been yell-leader for the Cardinals, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">many a desperate football game between Stanford and</seg><seg type="columnLine">California. The captain merely said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Looks as if the weather-planes have got theirs, San-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. Else we should ha' heard from them, by now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Too bad. I pity anybody up in the air on a day like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this." At which the captain went away, smiling grimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself. Even the radio man was a true son of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Wherever the captain went, it was the same; all hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their tasks, if anything, more earnestly engaged than</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual. For all that any man knew, the ship might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in momentary danger of going to pieces; certainly every</seg><seg type="columnLine">joint in the steel-braced structure was complaining of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extra duty. But the humans made no complaint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only one man down below was even curious as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was going on in the world outside. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young preternaturally serious chap who sat in the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a wilderness of dials, indicators, meters, levers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">handwheels. The control of the ship was at his fingers'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tips. A telephone was clamped to his head; also, in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of accident to the wires, the good old gongs were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Irons?" McTavish inquired, noting that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistant engineer held the post. There were two en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineers, of course, and Irons was supposed to be on duty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothin' serious, Cooper?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I think not, sir. He said he had got very little sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night, due to an uneasiness which he always feels</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a storm is brewing. I fancy he expects to relieve</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Seymour from time to time during the night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see." McTavish started to go. "Of course, sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose anything happens, my lad, lose no time in callin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No, sir." A slight hesitation, then: "Is there reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">to expect anything to--to happen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Always, in a starm like this!" But the captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was not at all anxious. "Ye mus' know, m' lad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we canna see a knot ahead, from th' bridge. 'Tis a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter only o' keepin' our wits; for no mon knows which</seg><seg type="columnLine">way we go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The youngster's eyes opened wide. "Is it true, then;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compass is worthless in this sort of a storm?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Weel, suppose we ca' it, un-reliable. At least, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">tells us we're headin' mare sou' than narth. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">somethin', isn't it?" And the captain's grim smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought an answering curve to young Cooper's mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not know that McTavish spoke the literal truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back on the bridge, the captain surveyed one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows. The steersman's coat was thrust into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where the glass had been. McTavish mentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">added ten miles an hour to his previous estimate of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred for the wind's velocity; and, securing a spare</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket, he started to fit it about the shoulders of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man at the wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Instead of submitting, however, the sailor shook off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain's hands. "I'm half roasting, as it is," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained. He glanced at the figure of his mate, dozing</seg><seg type="columnLine">precariously in a chair at the other end of the "coop."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every half minute his head would droop, whereupon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship would hurl him half out of the chair; and back he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would crawl again, all without opening his eyes. "I hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bother Billy, sir; but if you don't mind--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MCTAVISH took the wheel. The sailor staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the cabin, there to stand in front of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced draught, and to revive. Within ten minutes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was back, much refreshed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, sir. By the way"--for he was a cultured</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Canadian, that sailor--"by the way, what's our</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo, may I ask?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ye dinna know? Mon--ye should na' come aboard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft except ye know her cargo! 'Tis"--McTavish</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, remembering that seamen were no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves of superstition, but of science. Instead of finish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing what he had started to say, the captain answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'Tis a curious bit o' freight, lad. The ship's a travel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin' nursery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nursery!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Aye.

"Seems, ye can tell me somethin', 1100."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know the whole affair, sir. But I've always</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood that the Northern Territory is rich in possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilities; only, it hasn't had a chance.

To encourage the syndicate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Commonwealth had to donate every third section;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it will probably be worth while, in the long run."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So, these trees o' ours be destined t' build up th'</seg><seg type="columnLine">country," commented the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; and I shouldn't wonder, sir, but that the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the country depends largely upon this one ship. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I have started thinking about it, I recall having</seg><seg type="columnLine">read that this shipment was raised, partly under cover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a cost of some fifty million pounds. These trees are</seg><seg type="columnLine">--let me see--four years old, sir. The syndicate is</seg><seg type="columnLine">really banking on them, if I understand the thing right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. Unless, by transplanting these trees, it can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate results along horticultural lines, it forfeits</seg><seg type="columnLine">contracts of some sort with settlers upon whom the syn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicate is absolutely dependent for future support."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Queer," muttered the captain. "I know, now; some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one told me about it, an' I ha' forgot. I was worrit at</seg><seg type="columnLine">th' time, by hearing' that th' cargo were so heavy in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dare say," rattled on the sailor. His memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had read was now thoroughly awakened. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems that the syndicate went to great expense to dupli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate the exact climatic conditions, in their hothouses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which these trees must encounter when they are placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Australian soil. The idea is, of course, to take ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of the recent rains and secure a foothold before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dry season comes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By doing this, you see, the desert will have something</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which to hold the moisture. The trees have a head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">start. Hitherto, it has been a hard matter to grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, on account of occasional droughts; dry spells,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as in the past, have driven the settlers into con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidering imported labor. The climate, of course--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Tis na place for a white mon," evidently quoting</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone in whom McTavish had confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But these trees will make it very different, sir! Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">let them get a fair start--and there's thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlers on the spot, now, fairly itching to get their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on this nursery--and the climate will become as</seg><seg type="columnLine">good as any in the same latitude."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I belie re ye're right," responded the other. "In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know ye are; I've heard a' this before, but I've had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ither things t' think about. Th' Commonwealth will</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose th' onl." chance it ever had, should anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He closed his mouth firmly, and turned to go. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same instant the sailor, peering sharply into the wilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness ahead of the ship, gave a startled exclamation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain wheeled, and looked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Breakers!" he roared. "Put her over--quick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sailor was already twirling the wheel. Down be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, the ship's marvelous machinery was responding per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly. Under ordinary circumstances, nothing wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a wind like that is not ordinary. Like a seaplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching a beach, the giant ship rushed headlong to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the reef. And before the vessel could answer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her rudder, before any human power could prevent, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern of the ship was smashed. Smashed, with a jar</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shook the freighter from end to end, just as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung past the west end of the reef. And the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not need the report that was shouted up to him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine-room:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great God, sir; the stern's a wreck 1 Half the propel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lers, and the rudder--all gone, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain merely bit his lips. Next moment, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, he was hanging on for his life as the huge boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless as a cockle-shell in the grip of that raging fury,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrashed about wildly, her head totally lost, and nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a miracle to intervene between her and utter de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God save us," solemnly pronounced the Scotchman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We canna last anither hour!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE three men quit the bridge. There was no use</seg><seg type="columnLine">in remaining there any longer. And when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the cabin, they found most of the ship's com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany there ahead of them. Only the radio man remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his post.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Tis a thousand t' one against us," McTavish calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced to the silent group that faced him. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">best guess is that we're nearing' th' Solomons, wi' no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship closer than two thousand mile, good enough t' help</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What say ye t' a wee bit o' somethin' t' eat?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And supper was eaten quite as though none realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the longer the ship remained whole, the smaller her</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances became. It had been a question of hours; now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a matter of minutes. But not a nerve showed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of giving way, although the strain of waiting is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hardest strain of all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was, each knew, a waste of time to even think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking to the boats. Fine affairs though they were, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not live ten seconds in such a sea. No; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do nothing but wait, and make the most of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">additional life as might be granted them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The radio man joined the group. "Mate is fixing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reserve equipment," he reported, through a sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wich. "The regular outfit is gone west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The last message, captain, was from the Control at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manila.

She had sprung a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leak, and was badly canted to the starboard. Presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain cast an appraising eye at the wall, estimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that list, and sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Weel, ma friends, if she holds togither that long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she'll capsize inside o' ten minutes.

But next second he was staring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderment at his friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sea, like a flash, had gone still. No longer did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship toss and shiver in the grip of the waves. Along</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sides the wind still shrieked, as hellishly as ever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But--the sea was still!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the Lord!" swore McTavish, reverently. "We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been washed ashore, high and dry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran to the bridge, with most of the crew at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels. There, they looked out upon--not the island that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain had expected, but the sea. Nothing else!</seg><seg type="columnLine">On every side, as far as the searchlights could reach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the raging waters could be seen. Except that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, in that peculiar glare, somewhat further below</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck than they had been before, the appearance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the same as had met their eyes during the day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet, the ship was still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Strange!" muttered the Scotchman. "Have we</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on th' top of a moontain?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before he had ceased speaking, the ship began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move. It was a gentle motion, from side to side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down, rythmical, regular, systematic. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not like the toss of a boat in water; it was more like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swaying of a locomotive, together with the rise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall of a horse. But it was smooth, for all that no man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could remain upright an instant without a stiff grasp of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sided altogether. Only a little wind remained. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, some went to the bridge.

However, there must have been some who</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized, as they read the name of the supposedly lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">freighter, that the future of Australia had become mirac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulously secured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These people, today, are among the hundred million</seg><seg type="columnLine">who are the Nth Man's worshippers.

The roar of the sea, after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    the lost thunder when the crash occurred, had subsided</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    altogether. Only a little wind remained. . . As they looked,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    the truth gradually dawned upon their incredulous minds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">something solid. It was like no motion that any sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man ever experienced before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a soul got a wink of sleep that night. That inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicable, steady motion continued until dawn, with per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps half a dozen intermissions during which the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was motionless. Was it in the grip of some unguess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably big aircraft?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the searchlights showed nothing but clouds aloft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no explaining the mystery. The storm, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could understand; but a thing like this, that baffled all</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding. Every man was sorely afraid.-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just before dawn came the crash. The ship struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such terrific force that everything breakable which</seg><seg type="columnLine">still remained whole, was shattered into fragments. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">included every electric light. The crew, hurled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, remained for some time helpless and unmoving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for the dawn to become a little less gray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship was strangely quiet. The roar of the sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the last thunder when the crash occurred, had sub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">is a close rival to her older sisters among the nations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it is due solely to the amazing fact which faced Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tavish and his crew when they looked around the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mammoth III had reached Port Darwin.

The date is December 31, which is, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, the day before New Year's Eve, as now observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Chinese in addition to their own holiday. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, by the way, may prove more significant than it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first appears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, although the incident has nothing whatever to</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NTH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">209</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">do with religious affairs of any kind, excejt very in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly, the setting of the phenomenon is to be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the "compound" of the Congregational Mission at Lin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ching, near the crossing of the Great Wall and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, Hoang-Ho.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the "office" of this mission, which was perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">more a hospital than a religious school, sat Miriam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osborn, a Californian, temporarily in sole charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the post. Surrounded by some half dozen Christianized</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese girls and aided from time to time by men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same conversion, she was doing her best until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">return of her superior, Mrs. Walsh. And there could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no mistaking the immense relief in the young woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face as, after binding a dress upon a particularly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreeable sore, such as many Chinese are afflicted with,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she dismissed the "case" with a hurried wave of the hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eagerly turned to the girl who had just entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Nama?" knowing that the young Chinese would</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand there till doomsday without speaking, unless first</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken to. "What is the new--good?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes -- yes, Miss Doctor," rattled forth the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Song Fow, who is up a--mong the tree, is have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Missus Doctor's cart, now com--ing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miriam Osborn's natural impulse was to dart out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office, through the gate of the compound and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the road, there to leap into Mrs. Walsh's cart and</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelm that lady with tears and affection. But dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity, in the presence of these grave, decorous people, for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bade any demonstration. Instead she waited with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of great patience until, all formalities over, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">women were finally alone in an inner room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I am so discouraged!" Miss Osborn burst out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mouth trembling as no Chinese had ever seen it</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I seem to get nowhere, Mrs. Walsh! Not one in ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembers the simplest rules of hygiene; and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cases I've had to handle lately--well, I thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen the worst, a year ago, but these are just simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">--" And the girl shuddered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Walsh was not in the least surprised. She un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood the delicate, high-strung girl quite well, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chinese, even better. And she knew that the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor had been shocked too deeply to feel cuch relieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">by sympathy alone. Mrs. Walsh wisely put another</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem into her assistant's mind, instead. Her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very sober as she spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know exactly how you feel, dear. I had to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with it all, you remember, several years ago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is an old story to me now; and lately I have come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look deeper than those awful sores, deeper than their</seg><seg type="columnLine">superstition and ignorance. There is something that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blame for it all. And--I think I have an inkling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miriam Osborn's personal troubles were instantly for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten. "You have? You really think you know, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last?" And the girl paused, breathlessly. She had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways felt, somehow, that the Chinese mystery was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainable. If only she could understand these people!</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What have you found out?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Merely an inkling, as I said." Mrs. Walsh sat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of a bed. Miss Osborn remained standing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I think it may prove the key to the whole riddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know that I stayed over at Yokahama, on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way here." She paused significantly. "Well, by good</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune I met Viscount Soraki at the hotel!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Viscount Soraki? The liberal whom you have always</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to meet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He. And he told me things--not too much, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a cautious man--but enough to let me form my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusions. As to just what he said, I shall have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give it to you from time to time as it occurs to me; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">amounts to a great deal. But my conclusions, as gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered from what he told me, are these:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A certain well-known Oriental government," pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posely speaking guardedly, "is now an openly auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cratic one. To put it in a word, all our difficulties here</seg><seg type="columnLine">--all our problems of superstition, ignorance and vice--</seg><seg type="columnLine">are due to the deliberate interference of that country 1"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You believe that?" Miriam's eyes narrowed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger. "The Chinese are being kept back, in order that</seg><seg type="columnLine">--these other people may dominate them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Walsh nodded, gravely. "Through bribesy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the native teachers, and in other ways, the Chinese an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cestor-worship is being kept alive. Were it not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, our Christian and scientific truths would soon be</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopted everywhere; for the Chinaman is a lover of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth, and quick to change his ways, once he is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced. We are fighting--this other nation's money!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">That night, seated in the little garden around which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buildings of the compound were placed, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">women discussed the facts that the progressive Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">viscount had confided to Mrs. Walsh. In the end, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osborn asked her superior if there was any hope that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation would change for the better. Mrs. Walsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked dubious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is just one possibility. And that, I am afraid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is very remote indeed. I mean this: If something tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous, something in the nature of a national miracle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should occur, the Chinese might lose faith in ancestor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worship and all the anti-progressiveness that goes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. For example, suppose some strange malady should</seg><seg type="columnLine">wipe out all the school-masters in every province. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an event would destroy confidence in these men, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore in what they taught.

The young woman's eyes were dilated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a curious fear. "Hush, Mrs. Walsh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE older woman, without moving, cast a keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance about her. And in a whisper as guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as her assistant's, she inquired: "What was it? Did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear something, or--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes! Outside the compound! A queer noise, like--</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the thunder of a distant waterfall!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The oddity of the comparison struck Mrs. Walsh with</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar force. She gave the girl a sharp glance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You saw nothing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No; but" -- The girl paused as though aware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something very lacking in what she had said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She threw back her head, and managed to speak in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural voice as she added: "Never mind! Probably--</seg><seg type="columnLine">my nerves! Go on with what you were saying, please!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, I haven't any more thoughts on the subject.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I say, unless something happens to change the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation's policy towards China, something must happen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change the Chinese policy towards its ancestors. Other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise, the future is even blacker than the past!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean by that?" in sudden anxiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Walsh bent and whispered in her assistant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear. The girl's face went white. Her lips moved con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsively, and a single word escaped her:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "War!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," from the older woman, with quiet certainty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And conceive, if you can, of great hordes of well-armed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">obedient Celestials, under the control of that emperor--</seg><seg type="columnLine">overrunning the Anglo-Saxon world!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more that strange feeling of conviction, of moral</seg><seg type="columnLine">assurance that the truth had been spoken, gripped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilled the heart of Miriam Osborn. And a great wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">of grief, as for the lives to be lost, the misery to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered, surged over her and left her sobbing hysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally. Mrs. Walsh, strong woman that she was, stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lifted her assistant and carried her bodily into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">210</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About eleven o'clock that night, following the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom, the two missionaries held a simple watch-night</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting. There were none but the half dozen girl con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verts, however, to share the experience with them. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Chinese were making the darkness hideous with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usual Celestial methods, from firecrackers to gongs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortunately, the compound was located far enough away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the racket, not to be disturbed by it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But just after midnight, as the little Christian band</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to disperse, it seemed to them that the noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the village was inordinately great. To the mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">noises were added the mingled shouts, wails, screams and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanting of a populace that seemed to have suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone mad. Never had the natives been so noisy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same time, the missionaries became conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the earth was trembling. It was far from being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious earthquake; but it continued, almost without</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceasing, for nearly half an hour. At the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that period it was severe enough to shake all loose articles</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from the walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accompanying it was a very peculiar sound. It re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded Mrs. Walsh of a great storm, as heard through</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly barred windows and doors. It reminded Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osborn of something else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like what I heard early this evening!" she exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only, ever so much louder!" But she admitted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time there was a rumbling, crashing undercurrent</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was missing in the first place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When it was all over, having felt very little alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the matter, both women went to bed and slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">soundly. In fact, they did not arise till an hour later</seg><seg type="columnLine">than usual, the next morning. They ate breakfast with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the slightest notion of what had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About eight o'clock, one of the teachers of the village,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a "wise man" of whom Mrs. Walsh had spoken as being</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pay of the foreigners, arrived at the head of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary procession. It comprised several hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, women and children; they seemed to have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered together within the past few minutes, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though on the spur of some mighty, unseen impulse. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something so helpless, so bewildered and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy in their attitudes, down to the last soul, that neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the missionaries thought to feel any misgivings. Time</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, when such a horde, descending upon the compound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have meant a massacre. That morning, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both women instinctively felt that the mission was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of refuge, not of mischief, to the crowd that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder what it can be," breathed Miss Osborn, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she hurriedly got together all the available surgical</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressings. She gave another glance through the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow. "They are so quiet! Can it be some new epidemic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Walsh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The older woman could not say. "Somehow--I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know why--I think we won't need our kits today."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a queer look in her eyes. "It is a hunch, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will pardon the word. Leave your supplies where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wondering, the young doctor obeyed. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped side by side into the door-yard. And they mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velled to see that every Chinese who could do so, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowding into the gate which had always been shunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by more than half the population. What could it mean?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Missus Doctor, and Miss Doctor," began the teacher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though badly pressed for time; "we come--you make</seg><seg type="columnLine">him Chlistian. Light away!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both women stood, rigid with astonishment, and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">nt one another with unbelieving eyes. Mrs. Walsh was</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to recover speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What means this, Sing Fo Tan? You want to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christian? Just you?" pointing directly at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me!" He waved a hand to include the crowd behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and about him. "All mes! Want--all Chlistian!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something must have happened! Something, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">a change in the plotters' attitude towards such as this</seg><seg type="columnLine">teacher. Mrs. Walsh could not know that a similar scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being enacted at that moment in each of two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred other compounds in that part of China. She merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped close to the Chinaman, and searched him through</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through with her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe you," said she, suddenly stepping back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing but eager helplessness in the Celes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial's wide open eyes. "Come in then! Everybody--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE crowd swarmed into the compound. Miriam Os-</seg><seg type="columnLine">born took a deep breath, and signalled to her half</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen converted helpers. If only each were a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">times as efficient, now!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the enormous task was not begun before Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walsh, herself dealing first with Sing Fo Tan's case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded what had caused the strange affair. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no objection to answering, but he stuttered lamely in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiful attempt to find the English for his thoughts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally he gave up and resorted to his own tongue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking very slowly so that Mrs. Walsh could under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have come to you because there is no one else to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom to go. My people have come to me, seeking that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I cannot give; and you must help us, because we</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot help ourselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The wisdom of our fathers is no more, Missus Doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor. That which occurred last night has destroyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith of my people in the things I have taught them. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">has destroyed my own faith, Missus Doctor. None but</seg><seg type="columnLine">your faith can be strong enough to withstand this dread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What dreadful thing?" demanded the missionary, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague feeling of wonder creeping over her. "Speak up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sing Fo Tan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you not know?" in surprise. "Surely the Missus</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor has eyes with which to see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he rose and stepped to a window, and pointed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north. Mrs. Walsh started to follow him, but before</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could leave her chair one of the Chinese girls came</seg><seg type="columnLine">running in. It was the girl who had been charged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the care of the wireless telephone, the station being pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided with enough apparatus to enable the receiving of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any messages from Pekin, or thereabouts. The girl was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too excited to use English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick, Mrs. Doctor! The voice machine is talking!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is from the mission headquarters, in Pekin!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sing Fo Tan must wait. Mrs. Walsh hurried into thtf</seg><seg type="columnLine">little room where the instruments were kept. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment she adjusted the headpiece, she heard the fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar voice of the missionary who superintended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">district.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go outside, everybody, and take a look at the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wall! And don't show the least astonishment, no mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter what you see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half understanding, Mrs. Walsh ran back, and called</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her assistant. The two rushed to the window where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old Chinaman still stood. And each saw that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">made her doubt her senses, and wonder if the day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracles had come once more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Great Wall of China, that massive barrier against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tartar tribes, and equally massive barrier, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds of the Chinese, against the idea that anything new</seg><seg type="columnLine">could possibly be good--that tremendous, and perhaps un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">equalled work of armies of coolies, fifteen hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and composed of mountains of stone--the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wall of China that had, by its very immensity, blocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way of progress in the Chinese mind for seventeen</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries, was gone. It was effaced--annihilated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day before, it had stood there, a few miles north</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NTH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">211</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mission. Overnight, it had disappeared. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Wall was gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg><seg type="columnLine">From 1920 to 1933</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN detectives and others began to investigate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extraordinary events of which the Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wall incident was the last, they invariably made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">list of the phenomena and carefully compared them, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hope of deducing an explanation. Such a list, cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the six episodes in their chronological order, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">read something like this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First, in 1920, the rescue of Florence Neil, then about</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine years of age. As said before, this incident was</seg><seg type="columnLine">destined in time to exert a profound influence upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great many people. Its sequel begins in the next chapter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the time being, it is enough to point out that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescue, utterly inexplicable by any stretch of the imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, being quite beyond the powers of any known agency,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether of land, sea or air--this rescue showed no par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular amount of intellect behind the unknown Thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that performed it. A child's mentality, given the physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal power, could have done the stunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the second incident--the placing of that fifteen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton "nugget" on the deck of the "Cristobel," off the coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Chile, in 1922--a similar deduction might be made.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A mature mind need not have been behind that. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, one might say that the stunt was the work of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, who would naturally have a passion for privacy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried treasure and the li-e.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the affair in Egypt, in 1924, when the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient Sphinx was broken from its place and transferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the top of the ryramid--that is not so easy to analyze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is, of course, something childish about it; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is also something decidedly pat in that stunt. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted the case astonishingly well. Was it not like some</seg><seg type="columnLine">schoolboy's prank; does it not remind one of the ridic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulous but clever things that sophomores in high schools</seg><seg type="columnLine">are forever doing?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fourth episode, when the bank was stolen from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamburg under such extraordinary circumstances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bears out this theory. It shows, of course, more ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turity of though, and, as in the preceding case, it cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly was pat. One is irresistibly reminded of high</seg><seg type="columnLine">school seniors and their dignified, but distressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">escapades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus these four seem to indicate a progressive rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionship, as though their unknown perpetrator were</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily developing during the years that passed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moreover, the stunts themselves show a certain pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressiveness in the matter of mere size. Each miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">is correspondingly more difficult, more terrific in dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions, more incomprehensible in the light of ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge. In fact, it was the stealing of the bank which</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to the series to be called "The Colossal Mysteries."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the fifth event leaves the investigator wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether this "progressivism" theory is worth much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Certainly the rescue of the Mammoth III, and its puzzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">transposition from a spot in mid-Pacific to an inland</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting-place, two thousand miles away--overnight!--</seg><seg type="columnLine">this challenges the mind to the utmost, to even compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hend the vastness of the Thing whose powers were thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">made manifest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, when the incident of the Chinese Wall, in 1930,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its absolutely incomprehensible annihilation between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the setting and the rising of the sun, is considered calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the light of the perfectly indisputable evidence--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for where is the wall today?--when this staggering mira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cle is weighed in the scales against the products of reason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seems to overbalance all that man can offer. Appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently it is beyond explanation. How can any theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly account for a display of energy so terrific, bo</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly instantaneous, and so intelligently calculated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get net results? What becomes of the notion that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysteries are due merely to progressive development on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the part of the powers controlled by their unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">author?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Still, astounding though the facts may be, and unsatis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fying though the "progressivism" theory may seem, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other theory fits the facts so well. One cannot conceive</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any human agency developing such powers as are in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicated by such results. And yet, one is equally unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to conceive of any other than a human agency behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The works are Brobdingnagian--yet human.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All of which leaves us free to consider the events of</seg><seg type="columnLine">1933, when everything came to a climax, and when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world was treated to something even more astounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the six Colossal Mysteries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nineteen-thirty-three! What a year that was!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ambition and the Man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE magnificent residence of Daly Fosburgh, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casawaya, has recently been purchased by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">state, and from now on the estate will be a public</seg><seg type="columnLine">monument. The reason for this will soon be perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Even back in 1933 the mansion was the chief pride of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town. It belonged to the most important citizen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that exclusive little town of important citizens, the home</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wealthy Californians who were desirous of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from Burlingame and other places once consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered "high-toned." But the common people had begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">to invade these towns; so they had to be abandoned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the game of golf had to be abandoned by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elite as soon as ordinary folk took it up. But the year</seg><seg type="columnLine">1933 saw Casawaya ranked even above San Diego.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mansion of Daly Fosburgh, on the evening of</seg><seg type="columnLine">April 30, was the scene of a very extraordinary confer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. Three people faced each other in one of the draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rooms; and such was the tenseness of their attitudes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither noticed the lateness of the hour--it was long</seg><seg type="columnLine">past midnight--nor any other fact than the topic which</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped their attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The younger was a girl of perhaps twenty-one, slender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">piquant, even elegant, despite her conventional black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-white costume, which proclaimed that she was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the many maids employed in the house. Had she</seg><seg type="columnLine">been attired in the fashion of the day's bon ton, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have admired her without reserve for her dainti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, her clear, unspoiled gaze, and the intelligent resolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in the set of her exquisite mouth and chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She contrasted sharply with the young fellow at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. He was big, and his complexion as slightly blond</seg><seg type="columnLine">as hers was a trifle dark. His good looks lay less in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes than in the remarkable regularity of his rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">large features. A six-footer in perfect condition, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed about twenty-two. He and the girl resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another only in the attitude and expression of high</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolution, which appeared to be directed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third person in the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This was a man, nearly sixty years of age, and bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon him all the marks of aristocracy. From his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall, slender figure to the way he fingered an unlighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar, his looks and manner proclaimed the out-and-out</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrician. There was no mistaking the high forehead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proudly arched eye-brows and the delicately modeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">white moustache and imperial. Had he been dressed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other garb than the conventional evening dress, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would still have been distinguished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do not seem to understand," he was saying, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones as distant and cultivated as one would expect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am not questioning this young woman's probity, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">212</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">son; I am merely forbidding you to have anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">further to do with her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon me, dad, but I do understand!" rejoined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young fellow. "I understand that you expect me to for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get all that I have just told you, and, in a word, discard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Florence from my mind as though she had never en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the thing is quite out of the question.

This affair isn't what you think it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. Florence and I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense!" The aristocrat had regained his poise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There can be no such thing as a desirable union in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">case! No one would ever believe that an affair between</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gentleman of your breeding, and this poor child"--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Child!" exclaimed the girl. She drew herself up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her full sixty-two inches. "I am old enough to be held</seg><seg type="columnLine">legally accountable for my actions! And Bert is right</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he says that nothing out of the way has occurred!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">K</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE older man simply ignored her. "Such cases have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been numerous enough, Bertram. And they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitably ended in disaster for all concerned.

You must drop it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must?" The young man seemed to be having a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble with his temper. "That is a poor choice of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, dad!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not my word, alone, but that of a thousand or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more families which constitute the most cultivated ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of this country." The patrician now held the situ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation firmly in hand, and realized it, and was at ease.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let me remind you of your position in society, Bertram.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are descended from a long line of the finest peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple who ever lived. Your money--my money--was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">created in any vulgar fashion; it was not secured by</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculation during the Great War. It was got together</seg><seg type="columnLine">by sound, legitimate investment over a period of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">generations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None of your ancestors has ever held himself inferior</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the highest ranks of England. If we chose, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a title of our own, even now. Instead, for diplo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic reasons, we prefer to let our caste be manifest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your station in the world is at the top, Bertram.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The world was built, as I have told you many times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">primarily for the benefit of such as you and me. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who are so unfortunate as to be less well-born, are en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titled to no consideration whatever at your hands; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you talk of marrying one of the servants in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own household, you are merely absurd, Bertram; merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">absurd."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bert Fosburgh seemed to have been expecting some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like this. "You could say nothing else, dad. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you well enough for that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it is only in your opinion, that this marriage is</seg><seg type="columnLine">undesirable. I happen to entertain a different notion!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As before, Daly Fosburgh carefully avoided so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as looking at the girl. Now, however, he spoke in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarly impersonal tone, such as he reserved for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">servants, meanwhile keeping his eyes intent upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">task of lighting his cigar. "For the sake of argument,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will assume, my child, that you think you love my son</seg><seg type="columnLine">sincerely; that your affection is as noble as you claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to be. We will take all that for granted, if you insist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you forget that in the nature of the case, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">child, you are quite incapable of appealing to the higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Bertram's character. Appraising all your assets</seg><seg type="columnLine">at your own valuation, you are still, you must admit, far</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">short indeed of the kind of a girl that you would hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estly want him to marry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is this not so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not!" flashed the girl. She thrust an arm through</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lover's. "Perhaps I haven't been educated in art and</seg><seg type="columnLine">music, but at least I've been taught the things that really</seg><seg type="columnLine">count!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I feel absolutely sure, Mr. Fosburgh, that I can make</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert happy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The aristocrat nodded. "For about a day and a half,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">sardonically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl started to make a sharp retort, then, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden effort, she recollected herself and kept silent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert saw, and instantly exclaimed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you notice that, dad? She can hold her temper!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that's just the kind of a girl she is all the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through--restrained, controlled and dignified!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd be pi-oud, dad, to marry her! It isn't a question</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disputing your judgment; neither do I disregard all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you have said about society's claims upon me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's simply this: Do I love her? Well enough to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ray name? And is she--Florence herself, not her</seg><seg type="columnLine">station in life--is Florence 'worthy', as you say? Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir, my judgment says that she is! And my judgment</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have to stand above all else!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly Fosburgh let his cigar die out. He sat down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in silence studied the tips of his faultlessly mani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured fingers. When he was finally ready to speak, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, there was no sign of whatever may have passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bertram, my boy, you are stubborn. I suppose you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come by it honestly; all the Fosburghs have had wills of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own. I find fault only with your judgment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, my boy, I am so thoroughly convinced of this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I am going to prevent you from acting as you wish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are not to many this child. You are going to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">single until a wife is found for you among the people</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">who-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not going to marry Florence?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. If you will not listen to reason, you at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">will pay attention to something more effectual."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE boy gave an easy laugh. "I have the law on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, dad. You can't prevent me from doing as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">please. If I can't marry with your consent, why, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll marry without it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are mistaken," imperturbably. "Doubtless you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are thinking that, having come of age and therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">nominally into possession of your uncle's legacy, you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">now independent of me, financially?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite independent, dad!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is an error." The cigar was lighted again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I shall contest your uncle's will, and see to it that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are cut off without a cent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the boy laughed, but this time uneasily. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">court will have something to say about that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Everything. As it happens, the judge who will</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass upon the case is a personal friend of mine. A word</seg><seg type="columnLine">from me, and the matter is settled, my boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll appeal the case!" with sudden heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will do you no good!" also showing a touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">temper. Mr. Fosburgh hesitated a moment, then: "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I may as well tell you something now, rather than wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">until later, Bertram, that will save you the trouble of</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling me that you are prepared to leave me, rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept my dictation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But before I tell you, this child must leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment there was a clash of wills. Florence's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes flashed forth what she had schooled her tongue not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say. But Bert himself gently urged:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better do what he says, Flo. See you afterwards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl left. Immediately, Daly Fosburgh resumed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NTH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">213</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly as though the butler had opened a window in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to drive out a fly. He said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My boy, you do not know your father." At this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert looked up in some slight anxiety. Was--confession</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming? "You doubtless consider me to be little more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a capitalist, a dabbler in politics and a connoisseur</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rare books.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In reality, I have as high ambitions as any man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever lived! I have had these ambitions ever since you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were born. And one of these ambitions, my boy, is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see you rise higher than anyone else in America!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well?" after a breathless pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For years I have worked and planned, always en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely under cover, towards this end. My financial</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations have extended much further than any of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemporaries ever suspected. And it so happens that</seg><seg type="columnLine">your foolish affair with this nobody of a Florence Neil--</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that the right name?--your affair came just in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see my ambitions realized!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A few days ago I should have hesitated to confide in</seg><seg type="columnLine">you.

A great many people claim the honor of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to see him. In all likelihood, the number of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">people will increase with each generation, until a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">may come when several million children shall be told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that "your great-grandpa saw him before anybody else</seg><seg type="columnLine">did." However that may be, San Francisco gets the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The first official news of the newcomer was telephoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a patrolman whose beat was on the heights north of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sutro Baths. This patrolman's name was Sullivan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All quiet," was his report, "but there's a big man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing out in th' Golden Gate. Whot shall I do wit'</seg><seg type="columnLine">him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A big what? Standing where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A big man, sor, standin' in th' Golden Gate." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irishman was evidently on the point of exploding with</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement, but he was determined that his captain should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not guess it. "Whot shall I do wit' him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For God's sake! What a hell of a joke! Go back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your beat, and quit your foolery!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Beg pardon, sor," insisted Sullivan. "'Tis no joke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's a huge giant of a fella jist where I'm tellin' you</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is. He come out av th' sea, about five minutes ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' he's been a-standin' there iver since!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And thus, in the matter-of-fact words of a policeman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world was apprised of the most surprising event in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all history, ancient or modern. The Nth Man had come!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The city awoke. Mostly the news spread by word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth; for the soldiers at the Presidio, as well as num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erous fishermen and others whose duties took them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighborhood of the Gate in the early morning, had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time in telling all who would listen. And long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">any newspaper could put an extra on sale, the popula-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the city was pouring over the hills towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oakland, which by that time had outstripped San Fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisco and had become the first city of the west, was slower</seg><seg type="columnLine">in getting the news, but just as quick to act upon it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every available cross-bay craft was pressed into service,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Goat Island Bridge being not half commodious</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to accommodate those who had no planes. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">by half-past six, the greatest marvel on the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe was fairly surrounded by sightseers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Nth Man hardly moved from his position for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of the first hour. He seemed to be waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. And presently, when a large helicopter arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the grounds of the university in Berkeley, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made its way over towards the Gate, the visitor's pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose in waiting became clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The helicopter contained most of the faculty of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">college. They comprised the most advanced minds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west, and the world would believe what they said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And well indeed might the world wish to be assured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," said the dean of the college, leaning over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forward rail of the airship and giving the Nth Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">another scrutiny; "gentlemen, I am very glad indeed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you with me on this occasion. Otherwise, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">think I had taken le^ve of my senses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he fell silent. So did the rest of the faculty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in stupefied wonder they gazed upon what stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing exactly in the middle of the channel, his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot near the Sausalito shore and his right leg looming</seg><seg type="columnLine">within fifty yards of Fort Point, stood the vast figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Nth Man. From time to time he moved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodigious head, so as take in his surroundings the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better; otherwise, he strongly reminded one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient Colossus of Rhodes, the statue that stood astride</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance to the harbor of that name. But instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of standing a mere ninety feet in height, this wonder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twentieth century stood inconceivably higher, and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was alive!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was difficult for the eye to appraise him at his full</seg><seg type="columnLine">value. He was too immense. He was so enormously</seg><seg type="columnLine">large, that it was a problem to find any other large</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects, with which to compare him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was he taller than the Spreckles Building? Yes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">much taller! But--how much? The eye could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the people in the helicopter, the professors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose minds were somewhat more flexible than those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the millions of gaping sightseers round about, that finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the newcomer in his proper perspective. Comparison</seg><seg type="columnLine">again; it vfras the only way to appreciate him. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dean himself must be given the credit for being the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to approximate the staggering truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God!" he gasped. His face whitened, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook like a leaf, as the stunning fact was hurtled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his consciousness. "Men--the giant--he's taller than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tamalpais!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was true. The Nth Man overtopped the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain in sight!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, the world today knows the precise figures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he stood, towering into a sky which, for once in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the history of San Francisco, was entirely free of fog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His whole figure, except for that part of his feet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was covered by the waters of the bay, was clear to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision of all those millions. And they overlooked not</seg><seg type="columnLine">one detail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Especially did they note the curious thing which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried in his hands. At first no one believed what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw; then, finally, it dawned upon them that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole affair was real, and that the giant was actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding an ordinary battleship in his arms. Not till</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hours later was it known that this ship was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">214</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Pan-Asiatic super-dreadnaught, "Siamese Twin II," a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel of some 80,000 tons, armed with the usual twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five inch guns of the day. As for the story of its crew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken by surprise, driven from the vessel and put ashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Farallones--that would make a whole book in</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, and should not halt the progress of this little</seg><seg type="columnLine">account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so, perhaps, one hour was too short a time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to appreciate the marvel before the eyes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west. The thing could only be understood piece meal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was too vast to comprehend as a single entity. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professors in the helicopters who, hovering within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half mile of the giant, decided among themselves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appraise the newcomer in just that fashion; bit by bit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could reduce him to understandable terms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dean elected to examine the giant's eyes. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found them to be slightly small, in proportion to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of his features; and while the balls were bluish</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, the pupils seemed pure black. The dean was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded of a poetic expression--"twin lakes of fire"--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was startled to see a wonderful likeness. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodigious pupils, sparkling and flashing with some hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den emotion as the giant glanced this way and that, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly no smaller than small lakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they were devoid of brows or lashes. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lids, instead of resembling those of humans, were like two</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous shields of some hard, brown material. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant winked, which he did as often and as naturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any of those who eyed him, these shields dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in front of the pupils and, of course, flashed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">up again into a recess in the eye socket. It was odd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not disagreeable to watch. The lids were merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard, not soft; otherwise they differed from the rule</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile other professors were examining his ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were found to be shaped like most people's, measur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about as much, from top to lobe, as the height of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ordinary thirty-story building. They, too, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of that hard, dark-brown substance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men who were examining the giant's nose after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards wrote a treatise in which "a combination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roman and aquiline, with a projection of fifty yards in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the upper lip" was the way they summed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter up. The outer covering was the same as the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the face, that unknown, rigid material of chocolate</seg><seg type="columnLine">hue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mouth was said, by the men delegated to pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it, to be the most agreeable feature of the face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course, humans prefer that the lips be flexible and</seg><seg type="columnLine">curving, whereas the Nth Man's were rigid and straight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whenever he opened his mouth to yawn--he seemed nerv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously excited--his lower jaw merely dropped away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper, there being some sort of a sliding joint in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard substance at the corners of his mouth. Neverthe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, the net expression of his lips was good-humored,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious though that may seem. He was not grim, at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The teeth were large, white and in perfect condition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked competent to chew an ordinary oak tree with</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater ease than most people chew celery. And the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior of his mouth, as revealed by those nervous yawns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was red and clean, just like a mammoth edition of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">human's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those of the professors who were elected to examine</seg><seg type="columnLine">his facial expression, however, were obliged to admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were baffled. They agreed upon only three points:</seg><seg type="columnLine">The colossus was intelligent, he was not ill-natured, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was resolute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes certainly were those of a well-informed, self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled person, despite their terriffic size and lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">regulation setting. His mouth, as already said, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything but fearsome. But his chin, a square, straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut promontory of unmistakable strength, told instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his will-power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "His neck," certain professors later reported, "wa9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about two hundred yards in diameter, possessed of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">large 'Adam's Apple,' and remarkable chiefly for its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">covering. This was an extension of the rigid material</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which coated his face; but on the neck this material was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">formed in three rings, or layers, which overlapped like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the plates of a coat of mail. But we are sure that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">material was not metal. It was either bone, or leather</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of unexampled hardness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The people who were examining his mighty torso, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his terrific arms and massive legs, came to the same con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clusion about the substance which coated these parts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Except for the flattened steel hull of some ship or other,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which he wore in lieu of a breech-cloth, the giant was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unprotected by any other than this many-jointed coat of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scale-like, bony, brown-colored armor. Its true nature</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will be disclosed in due course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Thus, perhaps, one gets some idea of the Nth Man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The battleship in his hands made him somewhat more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">comprehensible even though it did remind one of a toy in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the grasp of a child. For the ship was nearly a thousand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feet long, and the giant carried it with as much ease as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">most men would carry a gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Again, his fingers might make him more understand-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able to those who cannot grasp the other details. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands were perfectly formed, the fingers nicely propor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tioned. On the backs they were protected by that un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">known material; inside, the "skin" seemed much like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">elephant's hide. His nails were dark, closely trimmed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and ranged in extent from one to two acres.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The colossus is devoid of hair," was another of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bits of description that have been handed down. "At</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">least, none was observed by reliable witnesses. This</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">armor of his seemed to have taken the place of liair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And so there you have the picture of that stupendous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man--for, all in all, he was merely a man on an un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">precedented scale, nothing else--towering into the sky,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">overlooking the bay and the hordes of curious people</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who were fighting to see him. Conceive of his head, sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rounded by planes, like that of an ordinary man in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flock of pigeons. His mighty form rose to that incredible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">height, with not one deformity to break the symmetry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of his figure. Straddling--the Golden Gate!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His sheer immensity was overpowering. Small wonder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">f that so few have attempted to describe him; the normal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vocabulary had never been strained as it was on that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day. Words must necessarily fail to convey an idea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which, in itself, transcends mere language. Language</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is based upon experience, and no experience had ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">before equalled this. The Nth Man, even as he towered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">above the rest of man's works, towered also above man's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">power to describe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   One little thing, more than all else, will help to bring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Nth Man within the comprehension of ordinary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mortals. Like most evidence of great value, it is indi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rect; it is a statement of what the giant did, not of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what he was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">IT occurred just at the end of the hour. At exactly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seven o'clock, when the sensation-proof clock in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tower of the university campanile was sounding the time,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the giant moved from where he stood. And two million</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hearts all but stopped as the hitherto motionless colossus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lifted first his right foot, then his left, and started</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The airplanes scattered like frightened birds. A dread-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ful sound arose--the mingled screams and shouts of that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suddenly terrified mob. But, before panic could spread,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the giant turned around and took four tremendous strides</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the water towards the ocean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There he paused, looking down. The crowd watched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in stupid, anxious wonder, as the giant keenly inspected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the waters about his feet. Then, he stooped and care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NTH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">215</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Standing exactly In the middle of the channel, his left foot	the Sausallto shore and his right leg looming within fifty yards of Fort</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Point, stood the vast figure of the Nth man .... this wonw _ of the twentieth century stood incomparably high .... and he was alivr</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fully placed the battleship upright in the sea; and from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">underneath one plate of his armor he plucked a brown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">object which he shook to the breeze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a fisherman's net, or rather, several of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest size, fastened together. The giant handled it</seg><seg type="columnLine">gingerly, as though fearful of breaking it. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had got the fabric shaken out to his satisfaction, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it hung from his fingers like a square of brown lace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gathered the four ends together, two into each hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bent down and dragged the net through the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next moment he stood upright, with his net full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish. A squirming, flashing, silvery mass, there could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have been less than fifty tons in that single haul.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the giant, holding the catch above his head, opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips and poured the net's contents into his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He chewed, noisily, for about three seconds. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one huge swallow; and a quantity of fish, sufficient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feed a village for a week, was gone down his gullet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He repeated the operation. Again and again the net</seg><seg type="columnLine">was emptied, while the people stood and gaped in help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less wonder. What if the Nth Man should fancy a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthful of them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But nine nets-full seemed to satisfy him. He put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">net back into its place, and stooped to retrieve the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had floated off a half mile or so. At the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant the giant saw something a little further out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the dorsal fin of a shark. Like a flash the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">dove, as a football player might tackle a runner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground shook with the impact as transmitted through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. At the same time, the splash sounded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such amazing loudness that it was heard as far south</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Casawaya. Also, the action created waves of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">height that every seal was washed off the rocks at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cliff House.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Nth Man drew himself to his feet, dripping but</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumphant. He had the shark by the tail. He held it</seg><seg type="columnLine">high in air, darting and twisting in his grasp; it was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minnow in the grasp of a boy. And the giant laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "HA, HA, HA!!!!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A terrific bellowing of mirth, which thundered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there in the sky; a sound which took almost ten sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds to reach the people on the ground. And the echo</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasted over sixty seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the colossus, with a swiftness incredible in so huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bulk, although proportionately no speedier than that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other man, flipped the shark into his mouth, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the fish were a sardine. One bite, a swallow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shark was gone to join the other inmates of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nth Man's stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, still having uttered no sound other than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that overwhelming laugh, the giant motioned for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplanes to get out of his way. They scattered, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant started towards the east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Past the Presidio he strode, his feet stirring up roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers that threatened destruction to wharves and all sizes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of craft. He noticed this, and moved more slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully. Presently he stood opposite Oakland, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted, staring down upon the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Next second he stooped; and resting the tips of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers in the space opposite the city hall, the tips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two others on a hill in Piedmont Park, the giant leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">far over and thrust his face towards Lake Merritt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There were a number of small boats around the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lake. These, the giant brushed ashore with his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--OS-0</seg><seg type="columnLine">216</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chin. Then he sank his mouth into the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake, and drank it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And next moment began his extraordinary march</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the continent of North America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">             CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">             Gulliver II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UP San Francisco Bay he strode, coolly stepping</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the Goat Island Bridge and bearing north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, so as to pass Berkeley and Richmond. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">every step his unbelievable legs covered over half a mile;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the giant walked slowly, considering his proportion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate height. His gait was hindered, not only by the ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">fathoms of water in which he stepped, but by sheer air</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he passed the campanile at the university, the Nth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man, almost without halting, leaned over and playfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitted the uppermost tip of the beautiful structure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The monument shuddered throughout its length; every</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell was thrown from its place. The giant drew back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though surprised and regretful of the mischief he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done; then went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached Richmond, however, his spirits</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have fully returned. Bending over, he scooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a double-handful of water--perhaps half a million gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lons--up into the air, as one playful swimmer might</seg><seg type="columnLine">"shove" water at another. And Richmond was treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an unexpected cloudburst, which left its streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished, but clean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On marched the giant, past various small towns along</seg><seg type="columnLine">that part of the bay and not pausing until he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">Port Costa. There, two huge train-ferries were at work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying freight from Benicia to Port Costa. The Nth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man, after an instant's survey of what was being done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached down and gently picked up both boats; after</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he set them down, each in the slip towards which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been heading. By so doing, he cut five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their time across, and incidentally made a mess of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their schedules.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still keeping to the water, which by now had nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed considerably, the giant stepped past Suisan Bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Collinsville, his immense height enabling him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily distinguish the Sacramento from the San Joaquin</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. He bore steadily upstream until almost to Isleton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the river channel became too narrow for his enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous feet. Then he took to the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wherever he threw his weight, there resulted a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">characteristic depression in the earth. Sometimes it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few feet deep, where the soil happened to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed hard; in other places his weight pressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground to a depth of ten yards. The shape of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding pits is fortunately preserved intact in many</seg><seg type="columnLine">places, so that we know the Nth Man's feet were above</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred yards long and nearly two hundred across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball, with toes and other details quite in proportion</seg><seg type="columnLine">to those of an ordinary adult's. But his toe-nails were</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceptionally long, and curved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps it was this experience of sinking with each</seg><seg type="columnLine">step, that made the colossus walk so slowly. Again, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be remembered that, as soon as he took to land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he immediately had to watch every move he made, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to avoid doing damage. This took time; otherwise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">considering that he was over fifteen hundred times the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of a six-footer, he should have walked that much</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster, which would have made his speed six thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per hour, instead of the even one thousand to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he actually attained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he took the most painstaking care with every step,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequently stopping short to inspect his surroundings the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better, that he might make no blunders. His eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">located about a mile and two-thirds from the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to cover a great deal of territory; and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked a clear day. On the whole, he did not lose as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much time as one would suppose, in his search for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safest route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ignoring the state capital altogether, the Nth Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed straight for Placerville. He kept away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads, usually planting his weight where the results</seg><seg type="columnLine">would work the least harm to crops. It was better to</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm vegetation than to interfere with traffic, as a pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a road would have done. Inevitably, however, a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of damage was done to cultivation; a matter which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant seemed to carry in mind, for just after reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the foothills he did a characteristic thing:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped and built a dam. The location was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of a small canyon, fed by a creek near Placerville.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engineers had despaired of building a dam in that spot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it had seemed to be too expensive a job. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nth Man simply broke the tip off a nearby peak, shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down into the narrowest part of the canyon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked on. Today, that dam conserves millions of dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars' worth of water, which is used by the valley that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bears the giant's footprints.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he reached Lake Tahoe. He stopped there a</seg><seg type="columnLine">full half minute, squatting in order to see the place the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better. Apparently he enjoyed the view as much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other tourist; and, like many of them, he decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">he needed a drink of the famous waters. So he bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and sucked up a few gallons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "AH!!!" he observed, with monstrous satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his drinking had caused a disturbance on the lake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as threatened to swamp some of the steamers along</seg><seg type="columnLine">its shores. Not letting go of his own pet, the "Siamese</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twin II," the great man from the sea carefully steadied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steamers with a touch or two, until the waves sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been on the march less than fifteen minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and already had reached the eastern border of California.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, he set foot upon Nevada soil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First circling past Carson, so as to cast an interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance or two at Virginia City--apparently its history</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just as romantically interesting to him as to any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body else--the giant bore off towards Carson Lake and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from there straight on towards the fast-rising sun. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have known that Austin was an absolutely dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, devoid of a single soul, now that its mines were</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally exhausted, for he planted one foot precisely in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of its deserted shacks. But he avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eureka and the many other well-settled localities along</seg><seg type="columnLine">his route, and hurried on towards the next state.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fiften minutes after leaving Tahoe, he was in Utah.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed eager to reach the Great Salt Lake; for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost ran while crossing the desert west of it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly stood in the middle of the water. Thereupon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming to take great delight in the action, he lay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and rolled over and over in the lake; and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got up he went on with visibly renewed vigor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bearing now to the south-east, the Nth Man picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way as gingerly as ever past Salt Lake City, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Blacktail country and thence along the Bad Land</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cliffs. At the Green River canyon he paused, gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">southward as though longing to follow its course; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pushed on towards Colorado, reaching the border line</seg><seg type="columnLine">at 8:47, Mountain time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS twenty-one minutes in that state was marked by</seg><seg type="columnLine">no particular happening, except that, while crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the backbone of the continent near Leadville, the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seen to stoop quite low. Evidently he did this in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to keep his head out of the rarefied upper regions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air. This problem of an air supply must also</seg><seg type="columnLine">havf -v -ted to keep his speed below what it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">bef</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. . aching Kansas, the giant made good time. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NTH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">217</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">air was not as transparent as that through which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just come, or else he would have proceeded faster. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was, he passed Kansas City at 10:20, Central time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a third of an hour after entering the Sunflower</seg><seg type="columnLine">State.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so the giant marched. It wasn't practicable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to pay for such damage as he did; it wasn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to avoid imperiling human life. But there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very few lives lost that morning on his account; for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift as were his motions, the action of the wireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">was swifter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the giant encountered the first of the Fed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral forces. This consisted of a fleet of two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">battleplanes, rushed north from Oklahoma to intercept</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The machines were provided with the most up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-date equipment, and armed with orders from the presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent himself. This fleet met the giant as he was strid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over Missouri, near Chillicothe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The commander of the fleet boldly drove his plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the Nth Man's right ear. And with the aid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a megaphone, the commander was able to make himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the name of the government of the United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">of North America," he shouted, authoritatively, "I com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand you to halt!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant heard and turned his head. But he kept on</seg><seg type="columnLine">marching. The commander shouted again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I command you to halt! Don't you understand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whereupon the Nth Man smiled broadly and nodded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though it were all a huge joke. And he kept right</seg><seg type="columnLine">on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The commander's orders did not state what he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">do in case the giant refused to halt. The orders merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">advised him to "use his own discretion." So the aviator</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the giant another inspection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That tremendous battleship, snuggling in the grasp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man from the sea, probably decided the matter for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airman; this, and the fact that the very air was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">turmoil, so violently was it agitated by the movements</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this modern Gulliver. It would be hard to do good</seg><seg type="columnLine">target work, with the air so unsteady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the commander decided that he had best follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant. When he looked back, however, he saw that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane was the only one of the fleet that had kept up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that thousand-mile-an-hour gait. His had been drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, it seemed, by some sort of a vortex that sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded the Nth Man's head. Once out of that swirl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the commander's five-mile-a-minute machine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopelessly left behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the Mississippi, the giant stopped for a sip of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddy but historic waters. Veering sharply to the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this point, he crossed Illinois without incident, reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Chicago--or rather, its environs--at 10:45. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stepped into Lake Michigan with unmistakable relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "WHEEU" he shouted, boyishly, as he splashed in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gargantuan fashion through the cold waters of the lake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"WHEEU"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hurrying past Kalamazoo, the giant soon reached De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troit, where he paused and stared in apparent astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at the vast expanse of factories, where, all passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger traffic having now gone into the air, the product was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already simplified to trucks and planes. But the Nth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man had no time to spare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving just two footprints in the soil of Ontario,</seg><seg type="columnLine">formerly a province of a separate commonwealth but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now one of the States of the North American Union, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant plunged in his business-like fashion into the waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Lake Erie. The vast amount of traffic, however, im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peded his progress almost as much as on land; so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was 12:08, Eastern time, when the man from the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged dripping from the lake and started -oss New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York State.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At every step he met Federal aircra	1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with ordnance, some only with authority. One and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded that he stop, and one and all, after a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two in the giant's proximity, were forced to fall back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to keep up with his terrific pace. As yet, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstration was made against him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the further he went, and the longer he remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon land, the larger the crowds grew. Planes, rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up for a fleeting glimpse of him, flew over mobs as dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the land could hold. The giant, however, made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice of walking where the ground was least crowded;</seg><seg type="columnLine">hence, most people saw him at a considerable distance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those who were nearer, were those who had to flee as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he approached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everywhere, it must be remembered, his tread shoo*</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth as it had never been shaken before. His prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress across the continent was marked by one continuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthquake. Even when he strode in deep water, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth trembled steadily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And every second that he was in motion, the air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverberating with the hurricane produced by his pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage. Hurricane, however, is a mild term for a disturb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance that would make a cyclone seem like a gentle breeze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Such was the howling of that gale, and the shrieking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind, it drowned out even the muffled thuds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant's steps. The world had never heard its like before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the man from the sea stood within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of Albany, at the bank of the Hudson. He stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">southward for a few seconds; and the word shot through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air to thousands of vessels along the river:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The giant is coming! Clear the way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IMMEDIATELY the march was resumed. Past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous villages along the "American Rhine," pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing scant attention even to the Palisades, much less the</seg><seg type="columnLine">works of man, the giant proceeded in his careful, thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ough fashion down towards New York. He reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city about 12:35; but, to the intense disappointment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Gothamites he did not pause, save to snip the flag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">staff from the new two-hundred-story Sanger building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He used this flagstaff, curious though it may seem, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a toothpick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Taking care to avoid placing his weight on any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnels that lay under the bottom of the river, the Nth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man waded on past the Battery. At the Statue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liberty he halted, long enough to take the torch out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand of the figure, and to replace it with a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid-fire gun, carefully abstracted from the battleship</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his arms. The substitution gave the statue a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">different appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As though the action were a signal, Fort Hamilton</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened fire on him. The shot passed above his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was meant to bring him to a summary halt. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did pause, as though astonished, but most certainly did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not halt. On he went; and next moment came the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This struck him full in the stomach, a tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-ton projectile which burst upon impact. Not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremor was seen to pass through the goliath's body. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just as though an egg had smashed against a barn</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. The hard, brown armor was absolutely undam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For the next twenty minutes, as the giant covered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining distance between New York and Washington,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was subjected to a continuous bombardment. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">battleships, forts and aircraft, thousands of tons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells, bombs and armor-piercing shot were hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">against that two-mile-high, human tower. And not once</seg><seg type="columnLine">did he so much as falter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For, although the most powerful weapons in the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">world had been turned against that chocolate mail, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">one projectile was able to get through. Here and there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where high explosive had detonated just right, a dent</seg><seg type="columnLine">218</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">or a slight pit was to be seen in the stuff. Some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates were made ragged on the edges. That was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the giant's eyes--the aircraft directed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts against these. If his sight could be destroyed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be made helpless. Each machine that could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">near him, if only for a second, discharged every avail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able piece towards those oddly hooded orbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the giant merely closed his enormous, bone-hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">lids over his pupils, and waded on. Afterwards it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that these lids had been artificially pierced, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their exact centers, with tiny holes. Too small for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectile to get through, these apertures allowed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant to pick his way just as readily as ever. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">still took the utmost care with every step, while cannons</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared from every side, and the steel rattled from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor like hail from a roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Could nothing stop him? It seemed impossible. Cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly no ordinary warfare could get results against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">body whose weight, as the world now knows the figures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran up to a third of a billion tons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But how about gas-attacks? They were tried, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal lack of success. If a bomb exploded very near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant's face, he merely waved a hand, as though some</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil-smelling insect were bothering him, whereupon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air was sweet once more to his nostrils, clear once more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gaze. A single drop that oozed from beneath one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those shielding lids, showed that the tear-gas had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had some trifling effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thus it came to pass that, when the Nth Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the Potomac opposite the capital of the nation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bombardment came to a sudden end. The city would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be endangered by continuing the attack. The gun-fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased; the aircraft drew away from the now stationary</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossus; and comparative quiet settled over the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down on the lawn in front of the White House the</seg><seg type="columnLine">president of the country stood, an insect of a figure, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by equally insect-like guards. In the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on top of buildings, stood the greatest crowd of peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple that the world has ever seen. In the air, close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million machines circled and hovered. A hush of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectancy, and then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somewhere a bell sounded the hour. It was just one</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock Washington time. The giant had crossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">continent in exactly three elapsed hours, having left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific Coast at seven o'clock by Berkeley time, or ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock on the Atlantic. It was incredible--but there he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. And the waiting mob asked itself just this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is he going to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so they watched and waited. The giant stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless. Perhaps he was tired from his three-hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk; perhaps he was forming a plan. At any rate he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no move or sound for the space of over a minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, without the slightest warning, he stooped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped Washington Monument. A gentle jerk, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous obelisk was uprooted; whereupon the Nth Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">most carefully planted it upright on the other side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, in Arlington Cemetery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As though satisfied with this display of his powers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant straightened up. And he looked right down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White House lawn as, for the first time speaking an</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligible word, Gulliver II thundered forth:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "WELL!! NOW--IT'S MY TURN!!!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XI</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Nth Man Speaks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SHUDDER of apprehension ran through the crowd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the bellowing tones of the monster crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from the skies. A shudder, not without</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason. The giant could speak English!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This made him, curiously enough, a far more terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">object. If only this barbarous apparition from the sea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were ignorant, stupid, unthinking, he might be trapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some manner or other. But--he was intelligent!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So reasoned most of the millions who heard. To others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, the fact meant just the other thing. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed the colossus wjth relief. For, it seemed to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if this towering human mountain were a rational, well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed being, there was less to fear from him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be reasoned with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, the monster waited about a minute before</seg><seg type="columnLine">making any sort of a move. Presumably he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone was watching his mouth, and so he purposely</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited until his exclamation travelled down to those on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. Thus they might be the more impressed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his size. For, as soon as the people at the White House</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that they had heard, the giant knelt; and by plac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his knees where the monument had been and resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his finger-tips near the executive offices, he was able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring his tremendous face to within a hundred yards of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the president's. All with the utmost care, and in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectful silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The president found his voice. Like any man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve enough to assume such an office, the gentleman</seg><seg type="columnLine">then president of North America was not to be out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced by even this prodigious thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" he demanded, nervously, of the giant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What is the meaning of this outrage? Explain your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, at once!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The monster smiled. It was an amused, tolerant, self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured smile, which had the effect of further discon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certing those who feared his intelligence, and of further</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieving those who welcomed it. He made no reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must explain yourself!" repeated the president.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sound of his own voice braced him considerably;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was a noted orator, and quick to adjust himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hearers. "The mere fact that you disobeyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to halt, and were not harmed by cannon, is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof that you can work your own free will with us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you have any case to make for yourself, state it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once! You shall be dealt with fairly! But--you shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">be dealt with; rest assured of that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A brave speech, under such circumstances. Those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard knew that it deserved applause, and several were</seg><seg type="columnLine">courageous enough to start a vigorous handclapping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whereupon the giant, smiling broadly now, leaned back</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his haunches and joined in. The blasting thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claps of his huge palms effectually drowned out all other</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound, just as the roar of cannon drowns out musketry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down came the monster to his kneeling position again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was quite at ease. Apparently he realized that, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as he kept in proximity to the president, he himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">was immune from attack of any kind. And he waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently until comparative silence was secured, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">making any response. Then he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"GLAD TO MEET YOU, MR. PRESIDENT!" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in an extremely gentle voice, compared with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous tones. It was all but a whisper; what ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">folks call, "sotto voce." Yet the sound carried that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards between him and the president, and filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poor gentleman's ears with thunder. A little louder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his hearing would have been destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"AS FOR MY NAME, AND THE EXPLANATION</seg><seg type="columnLine">OF HOW I CAME TO BE WHAT I AM, THERE IS</seg><seg type="columnLine">NO TIME TO GO INTO THAT NOW." He plucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">something from beneath a joint in his armor. It looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a tiny affair, there in his huge fingers, but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid on the lawn it appeared to be an immense metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest, bound round with seaweed. "THAT CONTAINS</seg><seg type="columnLine">MY HISTORY. LET IT SPEAK FOR ME LATER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"JUST NOW, MR. PRESIDENT, I HAVE COME</seg><seg type="columnLine">TO MAKE A DEMAND. IF YOU LIKE, YOU MAY</seg><seg type="columnLine">CALL IT AN ULTIMATUM!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The or ' -&gt;sped. So it was true! This monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">thii	to force his will upon America! And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NTH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">219</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Whereupon tho giant, smiling broadly now, leaned back on his haunches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">joinod in. Tho blasting thunderclaps of his huge palms effectually drowned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">all other sound, just as the roar of cannon drowns out musketry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">so far as they could see, he was practically certain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have his own way. How could they prevent him?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the president's nerve, outwardly, at least, was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all shaken. His voice rang as courageously as ever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he replied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This government, my huge friend, will never submit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dictation from such as you!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This demand of yours, whatever it may be, will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be something self-evident, something that can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted without the slightest objection from America,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or else you may consider it refused before it is stated!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I may as well say, first as last, that I cannot con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive of any such demand!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the president finished this speech, he advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards that gigantic face; and with his final words, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his fist and shook it, defiantly, indignantly. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer stout-heartedness, the president's action probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands without equal in the annals of man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant seemed to appreciate this. He moved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head ever so slightly, in an unmistakable bow of respect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he reached out one hand, as though to motion the</seg><seg type="columnLine">president back to his former position. It was a gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">move, but the president misunderstood; and, his nerve</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PUBLIC. SHE IS SUPPOSED TO BE RULED BY</seg><seg type="columnLine">HER CITIZENS, EACH HAVING AN EQUAL VOICE</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN HER AFFAIRS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"PRACTICALLY, HOWEVER, AMERICA IS RULED</seg><seg type="columnLine">BY ONE MAN. AND THAT MAN'S NAME I AM</seg><seg type="columnLine">PREPARED TO STATE!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is not true!" shouted the president, instantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is a government of, for and by the people!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"GOOD FOR YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. I EXPECTED</seg><seg type="columnLine">YOU TO MAKE SUCH REPLY. THE MAN WHO</seg><seg type="columnLine">FINANCED YOUR ELECTION WOULD BE SUR-</seg><seg type="columnLine">PRISED IF YOU SAID ANYTHING ELSE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"BUT THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS THAT YOU, AND</seg><seg type="columnLine">EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS COUNTRY, ARE SUB-</seg><seg type="columnLine">JECT TO THE DICTATION OF A SINGLE MAN!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is false!" shouted the president, louder than</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. This time he spoke mainly for the benefit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding crowds. "Each American is a free-agent, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every sense of-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly gave way; he turned and bolted impotently to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps of the White House. Not till then did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">recollect that the dignity of a nation depended upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He halted, wheeled, and drew himself once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">into an attitude as defiant as he could make it. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant spoke again:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"WHEN YOU HAVE EXAMINED MY HISTORY,</seg><seg type="columnLine">MR.

However-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see no reason," tartly, from the president, "why I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should pay the slightest attention to your absurd demand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not the slightest, my enormous friend!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, assuming that Congress should consider this</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposition, suppose it refuses to pass such laws? Or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposing they are passed, what if I refuse to enforce</seg><seg type="columnLine">such laws on the grounds that they are unconstitutional</seg><seg type="columnLine">or discriminating? What then, Mr. Giant?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The colossus slowly lifted himself to an upright posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Had he moved at all quickly, he would have smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">innumerable planes that were hovering over his huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk. When he was finally upright again, he waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody aside while he moved back to his former</seg><seg type="columnLine">location in the middle of the Potomac.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened his mouth and made reply. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on his heel, and strode seawards.

By the time his final words</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the ground, his enormous form had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared beneath the waters of the ocean. Back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sea he had gone, and the world breathed freely</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Who was he? Was he really a human being, like any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">other man on earth save in the matter of size and cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering? Or was he, as others thought, simply a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine of some kind, manipulated by a hidden intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the White House lawn still lay the great metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest that he had left. He had said that it would "speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him." The people eyed it eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the president's wits were still intact. He pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take that into the executive offices," he ordered, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin at once to decipher whatever you find. But, on no</seg><seg type="columnLine">account shall you make your findings public, until I give</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His secretaries hurried to obey. And, as will shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">become clear enough, there is small wonder that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary message in that chest was kept from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people for a long time. Only in the end was it feasible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make the truth known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is only one question of any particular im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance, just now," the president told America, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech made that night. "That is, the proposition which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant has placed before us. What are we to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the question! What was America to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the startling proposal of the man from the sea?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Informal investigations, carried forward by indignant</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens who disregarded all injunctions, uncovered some</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly disagreeable truths. The giant had been right!</seg><seg type="columnLine">One man was in control! The rest of the country was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominated by Daly Fosburgh!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What to do about it? A determined band of liberals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sense of liberty thoroughly aroused by these dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closures, energetically set to work to enlighten the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses. Their efforts were astonishingly successful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The president, through autocratic agencies, tried in sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral ways to provoke these workers to violence, but with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out results. Inside of two months, the membership of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Financial Reform League--committed to the giant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposition--had grown to amazing size. Three months</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed before it could even be counted, and by that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">over fifty-five per cent, of the population was enrolled!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The government viewed this league in alarm. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, despite all that could be legally done to prevent it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the League presented an absolutely unanswerable peti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion at the White house, the president could do no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to ask twenty-four hours time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He called his cabinet. He minced no words. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, his advisers were all secret members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heavy Hand. And, on the morning of August first, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of America were told just what to expect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The news reached Casawaya about five in the morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before six o'clock, every person in the Daly Fosburgh</seg><seg type="columnLine">establishment, from its aristocratic head down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last footman, knew what the government had decided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so it came about that Florence Neil knew, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as Bert and his father, that the United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">had decided to refuse the giant's proposition, to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the Financial Reform League. The girl immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately sought Bert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bert! It means war! War -- with that awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bert looked more or less indifferent. "To tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth, Flo, I'm not very much interested. I don't care</seg><seg type="columnLine">which way it turns out; I'll have something to be thank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful for, and something to regret."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't understand," drawing him down beside her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a settee. "I mean, I want you to tell me again, dear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all I can tell you now, sweetheart. If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant wins out, then I can go right ahead and marry you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And if he doesn't, then"--he suddenly drew her very</seg><seg type="columnLine">close--"then I'll have to get what satisfaction I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the situation into which my father intends to force</seg><seg type="columnLine">me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NTH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">221</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She already understood that he could not divulge his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's secret plans to make him emperor. And she</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not try to make him break his promise. She merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did you say you could do, if--if the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">wins?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can marry you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then"--tremulously--"I hope he wins, war or no</seg><seg type="columnLine">war!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, because she was a woman, and because she</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved Bert very dearly, she turned unexpectedly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried her head on his shoulder. While he, because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the right sort, let her cry as much as she liked, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">comforted her. It did them both good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime, the government declared the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be in a state of war, and appointed a censorship. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">this device, the Financial Reform League was silenced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its activities were officially condemned, its leaders thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">into prison, its propaganda destroyed as "seditious."</seg><seg type="columnLine">All of which is very easy to get away with, when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">country is at war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant had said that he would reappear in six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months. He had come on May Day; he was due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return on November first. There were just three months</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which to get ready for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one thing, the government tried to bring pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon various foreign countries, to aid in combating</seg><seg type="columnLine">"this peril to civilization, this horrible monster from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea." But, with one accord, each and every nation re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused to give any help whatever to the one country that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had failed to progress. She must fight the giant--alone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this while, the Nth Man had remained totally out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight. He seemed to keep to the deep seas around</seg><seg type="columnLine">South America, Africa and Australia. Enormous fleets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of airplanes were kept constantly on the wing, day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, with orders to report any sight of the monster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he managed to evade them all. Not till later was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it easy to understand how he did it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The secretary of war was an exceptional politician.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had not waited for war to be declared, before going</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead with his plans; but, seeing that this was no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to listen to precedent, he concentrated on producing</seg><seg type="columnLine">something new in warfare, something that could operate</seg><seg type="columnLine">successfully against an opponent such as no secretary of</seg><seg type="columnLine">war had ever before dealt with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How best to fight the giant? Certainly not with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary army of infantry, no matter how well equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with machine-guns and flame-throwers. Such would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no effect against the man from the sea. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it any use to consider the navy; ships could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">operate against a Thing that could create enough waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swamp every ship afloat. Similarly it seemed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">aircraft--ordinarily considered the main fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">branch--was useless in dealing with a monster who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could move faster than wings, and who could turn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air into a cyclone with a few waves of his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for electricity, or magnetic waves, the idea was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even mentioned. The giant's armor was obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">an insulator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No; the only hope lay in artillery. Not in ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive shells, either; nor yet in gas bombs. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant was too bulky to be concerned with any concoctions</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might be hurled at him. All he needed to do was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to agitate the air a bit, and thus relieve his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose of the most deadly gas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What sort of projectiles would get results? Obviously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just one: the remaining possibility and nothing else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the secretary of war, maintaining the utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrecy, rushed work along that line and no other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for men to wage this new kind of warfare, men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who could operate the hastily designed apparatus which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to conquer the colossus--the government tried its</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to secure them by the usual drafting method. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">method failed, so far as the common people were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned. The average American now fully realized that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a fool to fight Daly Fosburgh's battles. So,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any violence or disorder, each and every draftee</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would not be a beneficiary to Daly Fosburgh's suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess, coolly and quietly marched straight to prison, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscientious objector, rather than be forced into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranks. No amount of official propaganda was able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inject patriotism into a people who saw that this patri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">otism would benefit only a single man, and his favorites.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were willing to fight for their country; they weren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to fight for Daly Fosburgh's privately owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, in the end, mainly it was his friends and mercen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aries who did the actual fighting. There was no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">else to do it. And when all is said and done, the arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment worked very well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE actual chief of staff was, of course, the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">financier himself. But certain infirmities kept him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the field. He supervised operations while remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing quietly in his own home, surrounded by wireless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for his son, Bert--"My boy," said General Fos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burgh, when Bert had come into the library in response</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his father's request--"my boy, the time has come for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Fosburghs to show what they are made of. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">worl(J,'is waiting to see whether we are entitled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect we have always demanded. And you see for</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself"--displaying his handsome uniform--"that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made my choice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you follow my lead, Bertram?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an anxious appeal in the man's voice. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment he was not merely the man of ambition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a longing to rule the world. He was a proud</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, anxious to see his son make good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bert took a firm grip upon himself. He longed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mightily to show his dad just how much he loved him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this, as the general had said, was a time to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what sort of stuff was in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to disappoint you, dad," gazing steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his father's eyes. "As a Fosburgh, I consider it my</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty to respond only to the highest impulses within me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By nature, I dearly love a scrap; I should like nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than a part in the fight. And I'm as proud as</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I want none of this giant's blood on my hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He is right! I'm in favor of the reform, dad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And while, rather than offend you, I shall do nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all to help the giant, at the same time I cannot fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daly Fosburgh's thin lips twitched, ever so slightly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Otherwise he gave no sign. He merely said, in a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall try--to appreciate your position from your</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewpoint--Bertram. You may go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Bert went, and immediately told Florence. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it was she who did the comforting. The next day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert claimed exemption as a C. 0., and went to jail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, exactly six months after his first appearance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly as he had promised, Gulliver II came out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea again and stood for the second time on the soil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">North America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">The One Day's War</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE had been a great deal of speculation as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the colossus would emerge from the sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would he come straight back to Washington? Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">would he follow his former procedure, and make an</seg><seg type="columnLine">overland march from west to east? If neither of these,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then which, of the various other possible points of entry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would he choose?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Puget Sound," many predicted. "He could work</seg><seg type="columnLine">222</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">more havoc there, before being molested, than at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other point."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Others considered that he might come up the St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lawrence, and commence operations around the Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lakes. Still others, remembering how unexpected all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monster's actions had been, insisted that the authori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties keep a close eye on the Gulf of California. "He'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">wade up the Grand Canyon, and reach the heart of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country before we know it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But few believed that the giant would do what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually did. It seemed as though he had used the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible cunning, in entering at such a point. Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forces of the nation could be more readily concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated upon the Mississippi Valley than anywhere else</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the continent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So there was surprise, followed by elation and relief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Gulliver II was reported, at seven o'clock on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning of November first, to have show himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river opposite New Orleans. He would be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do very little harm, before an end was put to him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The population of the southern metropolis was, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last soul, out of doors to gape at the monster and .to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the beginning of his campaign. They noted that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed little changed. Some thought he looked a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger; but this, of course, is a matter not open to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion. Certainly there was no change in the details</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his horn-armored, enormously large limbs and torso,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no reduction in the awe-inspiring appearance of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently irresistible Goliath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood only for a second or so, gazing down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city. Then he spoke a few words and, as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done when last seen, he turned and marched upstream</seg><seg type="columnLine">without waiting to see the effects of his remarks. Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently these words thundered down:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I KNOW THE GOVERNMENT'S DECISION. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE THAN TO DECLARE</seg><seg type="columnLine">WAR. FROM NOW ON, IF I DO ANY DAMAGE, IT</seg><seg type="columnLine">MUST BE BLAMED ENTIRELY ON THE ADMIN-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ISTRATION.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I SHALL MARCH SLOWLY NORTHWARD. IF</seg><seg type="columnLine">YOUR GOVERNMENT STILL WISHES TO RESORT</seg><seg type="columnLine">TO FORCE, I SHALL HAVE TO REPLY IN KIND."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was all he said at New Orleans. Its import was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly clear, and decidedly disturbing. The monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to feel that he would succeed. And there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no denying that the government had not thought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">apologize in advance for whatever destruction might</seg><seg type="columnLine">ensue; but the giant had thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately, of course, the news of his arrival was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed through the air to the various authorities. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out an instant's delay--for all was in readiness, and wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--the engines of the new warfare were started on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their errands of destruction, each manned by determined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate but thoroughly competent though hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained men. And the world had never before seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">like of that attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moving inwards upon the Mississippi Valley, from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">points of the compass, surged a fleet of three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">"battle type" dirigibles. They flew from strategic points</seg><seg type="columnLine">along both seaboards, from New Foundland to Tampa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Acapulco to Sitka. Capable of two hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour and sailing at full speed, they closed in steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon their moving target.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the giant, he continued his quiet saunter up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mississippi, taking all his former care to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing any damage. Upon reaching St. Louis, he paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">and observed, with evident interest, the construction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new bridge at that point. The piers had just been</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished when the monster's first visit cut operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, leaving the nine sections of the bridge all</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled but still on the banks, awaiting the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the workmen would come back from on strike and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift the steel to the piers. All of which may have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">amused the giant; for the people of St. Louis heard him</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter a chuckle, a deep, reverberating note that shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">every window in town. Then, stepping carefully past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the piers, he reached over and picked up the bridge sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions; and after fumbling with them in the fashion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a child assembling a puzzle, he placed them carefully in</seg><seg type="columnLine">position on u;e piers. Thereupon, having accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">more in one minute than the builders could have done in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a month, the giant moved quietly on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">COMING to the forks above Alton, he took the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand branch without any hesitation, having evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently made up his mind on this point beforehand. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">he waded, now in the bed of the Missouri, still taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">great care to step over bridges, avoid all wharves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipping, and to keep clear of almost all power lines. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">few of these, however, he broke, seemingly having over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked them and apparently being quite unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">either of the strong, copper wires, or of the thrashing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sputtering menace of the heavily charged conductors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this manner he ran away, so to speak, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirigibles that were rushing from the east and south;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at the same time, he was going out to meet those</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were coming from the west and north. And so it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came about that when, after leaving the Missouri at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kansas City and proceeding up the Kansas past Topeka,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colossus finally stepped out of the water and strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few minutes northward, he stood at last not far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the geographical center of North America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it was there the dirigibles found him. Erect in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cornfields of Kansas, with Atkison on the east and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nebraska a few miles to the north, Gulliver II waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for nearly two hours for his attackers to gather. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">meanwhile he made just one more statement:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I WOULD RATHER HAVE PICKED A MORE</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARREN SPOT, MY KANSAS FRIENDS, FOR THIS</seg><seg type="columnLine">BATTLE; BUT I DECIDED THAT THE AFFAIR</seg><seg type="columnLine">HAD BEST OCCUR UNDER SUCH CIRCUM-</seg><seg type="columnLine">STANCES AS TO MAKE IT DECISIVE. YOUR GOV-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ERNMENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CLAIM THAT</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS CAUGHT UNAWARES. IT CAN HAVE NO</seg><seg type="columnLine">EXCUSE WHATEVER FOR ATTACKING ME</seg><seg type="columnLine">AGAIN."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raised his voice; and for the first time, humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized what sounds this monster could make. Remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber that he was more than fifteen hundred times the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of an ordinary man, and his vocal powers--since</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound varies as the square root of the distance--his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vocal powers were almost forty times as great as normal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is his voice could carry forty times as far. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"WE SHALL NEED A SPACE ABOUT A HUN-</seg><seg type="columnLine">DRED MILES IN DIAMETER! CLEAR THE WAY</seg><seg type="columnLine">AT ONCE!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was more of a hint than an order. The Kansans</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it without question. And thus we owe it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant's thoughtfulness that there was no damage to non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">combatants, and so little to civil property.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The dirigibles, swiftly tightening their circle about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossus, were, of course, in constant communication</seg><seg type="columnLine">with each other. The secretary of war himself was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">command. And when a distance of fifty miles sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arated each ship from the central target, the signal was</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to drop cargo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down on to the Kansas soil, each alighting squarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright and all in position for operation, landed three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred of the world's most terrific engines of war.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beside them, a moment later, landed their crews, run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning straight from their parachutes to their posts. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">well was the thing arranged, and so carefully practiced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that within a single minute the giant was surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Cramm guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day was clear. The sun was just past the zenith.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NTH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">223</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By shading his eyes, the colossus could take in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of that ominous circle, could see that he was in for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. But, far from showing the slightest apprehension,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he merely opened his mouth and roared:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "DON'T WASTE TIME ASKING ME TO SURREN-</seg><seg type="columnLine">DER! I REFUSE TO DO SO! GO AHEAD WITH</seg><seg type="columnLine">YOUR FIREWORKS!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The secretary of war, on the bridge of the flagship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit his lip in an effort to control himself. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly to the radio man at his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His blood be upon his own head! We can take no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances with him! It's murder--but it can't be helped!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The operator rasped the word into the receiver. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">next second the state of Kansas rocked throughout its</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, as the earth received the recoil of that massed</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Straight and true went every one of those three hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred projectiles--projectiles, made especially for the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose, and totally different from anything that had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">been used before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were each ten feet in diameter, and weighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety tons apiece. They were not shot from ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannon, but from electro-magnetic projectors, gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs, some five hundred feet in length and enormously</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful. Electricity, fed through a cable from each</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirigible, hurled the projectiles from each of these tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rushing at the rate of a mile a second, these ninety-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton missiles flew intact to a distance of twenty miles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as the secretary of war himself pressed a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">button aboard the flagship, each projectile answered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless waves that discharged its mechanism. Where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon, with a roar that was simultaneous in all the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred shells, these missiles became, in effect, aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannon; and out of their points shot secondary, armor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piercing shots, each a yard in diameter, and--absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbreakable!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There could be but one result when such missiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck. No conceivable target could withstand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous power of these shots. They had been known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to penetrate fifteen feet of steel. The giant's armor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was worthless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But very few of the three hundred ever struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark. For, as though he knew in advance exactly how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attack would be made, the colossus waited ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectantly until the instant the aerial cannon exploded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then--he ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If his former movements had seemed wonderfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift, they now seemed incredibly so. He dashed straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the north, right in the face of a hurricane of steel;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in exactly forty steps--the marks are there today--</seg><seg type="columnLine">in forty steps, inside of twenty seconds, the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the edge of that awful circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been struck in three places. His leaping, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, had rendered that careful aiming utterly value-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. Otherwise, he should have been riddled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of these chance shots pentrated his right leg, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently without touching a bone; for it did not inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fere with his subsequent actions. Another projectile in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicted a trifling wound in his side, carrying away several</seg><seg type="columnLine">acres of his armor, which was buried in the earth when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it fell and could not be recovered for some weeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a third shot pierced his neck. It went through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his windpipe, narrowly missing a jugular vein and lodg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a joint of his vertebrae. All this, of course, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not known until later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YET, the Nth Man, beyond throwing a hand to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck and uttering an exclamation of pain, did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">allow this awful wound to stop him. A great river of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood flowed out, each drop falling like a scarlet cloud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst to the ground, staining the soil to a curious brown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and rendering it wonderfully fertile, as afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved. As for the giant, the wound had only the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of making him mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He charged upon the nearest of the Cramms. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already reloaded--such was the excellence of its system</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but the piece was helpless. Its dirigible, tossed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a cork in the cyclt-ue created by the giant's leaping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had snapped the electric power cable. The piece was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the same was true of every other Cramm. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those three hundred dirigibles had become like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaf or a feather, flitting wildly about the heavens, im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">potent in the grasp of that hurricane. Not a Cramm had</seg><seg type="columnLine">any power to use. It was the one flaw in the plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Nth Man may have known this, and he may not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Certainly his rage knew no bounds. Uttering only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stertorous, rattling gasp, as he struggled for breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his shattered windpipe, he bent and seized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest of the Cramms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Up he straightened. An instant, while he gloated over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge machine that now resembled a mere trinket in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his grasp, and then, putting forth all his prodigious</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, the giant threw the gun into Oklahoma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Around the fatal circle dashed that raging monster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at every step scooping up one of the ill-fated guns. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">second followed the first, far to the south. The third</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fourth landed in Nebraska. And when, inside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">four minutes, the last of the Cramms was hurled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, the monster's rage was not yet appeased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He stood there for a moment or so, his chest heaving,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking around for other objects upon which to take re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venge. His breath came and went through that horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">gap in his throat, creating a dreadful, wheezing rattle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so loud as to drown out every other sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For there were other sounds. From the stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, shivering beneath the Nth Man's furious tread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came the united shouts, screams and curses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant's enemies. It was, in the aggregate, more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wail than a defiance; no one who heard will ever for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the cry that arose from that army of smashed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten humanity. It was a cry to heaven, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of hell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only for a moment or two did the colossus take any</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. Then, again shading his eyes, he peered around</seg><seg type="columnLine">in search of someone with authority. There was none</seg><seg type="columnLine">to appeal to. The secretary of war, tangled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage of his flagship, was at that moment lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead on the banks of the Platte. To whom should the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant state his demands?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and strode directly east. And presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrified people of St. Louis were listening to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones of his now ghastly voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "WHERE IS THE PRESIDENT? TELL HIM TO</seg><seg type="columnLine">COME TO ME, AT ONCE!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ten seconds later the demand was flashed into space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At Washington, it evoked an immediate response. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">response was made by an official who had just learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the battle, and who was so badly frightened that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively told the exact truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The president has run away! He left secretly, last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, and is now supposed to be on the Pacific Coast!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This message was received at St. Joseph, and given</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a very brave man to deliver. This man was formerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sea captain, and possessed of a powerful voice. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as he appeared, megaphone in hand, on the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Santa Fe building, the giant bent down to catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to understand perfectly; for he made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment. But, without a moment's delay, he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started westward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time he took no care at all with his feet. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed them wherever they chanced to fall; fourteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">people lost their lives, through failure to act quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">224</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NTH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough upon receiving the wireless warning. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant stopped because of none of that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He travelled more than twice as fast as he had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">six months previous. He made only three stops, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of these was barely more than a pause. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at a reservoir near Denver. This, he emptied be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore his thirst was assuaged. The second was at Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salt Lake, where he indulged in his second roll in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brine. The third pause was the longest, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped at Lake Tahoe to drag nearly every fish from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its water, getting barely enough to make a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One hour after leaving the battle-field, the Nth Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood again in San Francisco Bay. And without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">preamble he bellowed again:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"WHERE IS THE PRESIDENT?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mayor of San Francisco, as courageous a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ever lived, but also as sensible, knew that the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe course was to tell this living fort the absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth. A lie, and the giant might reduce the city to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust. The mayor decided to sacrifice the president to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greater cause--that of the city's existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will find the president," shouted this official,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a megaphone in the tower of the Spencer Build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, "fifty miles south of here, on the coast, in a town</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Casawaya! He is hiding with some relatives!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As before, the giant with the damaged throat made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no comment. He strode right through the Golden Gate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the south, and swiftly skirted the shore until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reached Casawaya.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Opposite the town he came to a stop. This time there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no need to demand his quarry. The president,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing by wireless of the search being made, in despair</seg><seg type="columnLine">had resolved to make the most of it; why not, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the game was up anyhow? He showed himself on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawn in the Plaza of the exclusive little city, and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced with such boldness as he could muster, out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open, in plain sight of the man from the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Nth Man saw him; and, as he had done six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months before, he knelt and brought his face to within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred yards of the president's. The effort brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">another gush of blood from the giant's neck; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughed and half strangled, but managed somehow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper with more or less distinctness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "YOU WERE A FOOL," he informed the president,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"TO DECIDE TO MAKE WAR. YOU OUGHT TO</seg><seg type="columnLine">HAVE KNOWN THAT I AM INVINCIBLE. ARE</seg><seg type="columnLine">YOU SATISFIED, NOW?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am satisfied," answered the president, heavily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This country cannot conquer such a monster as you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is nothing for me to do but to surrender.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What are your--terms?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant paused. He raised his head, and gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly around at the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was just noon, there on the Pacific Coast; for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant had come west at such speed as to make up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difference in time. He had travelled faster than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun; he had left the Missouri at twelve-thirty. What,</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceivably, would such a creature demand of mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I AM GOING TO MAKE JUST ONE DEMAND,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping one hand over his wound so that the escaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">air might not confuse what he was saying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"JUST ONE DEMAND, MR. PRESIDENT. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">SHALL ASK FOR NO PROMISES. PROMISES CAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">BE BROKEN.

With</seg><seg type="columnLine">' ' the exception of a few, like General Fos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burgh, who had remained on the coast to take care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that end of the work, most of the Casawayan male pop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulation was scattered over the field of battle. That is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the owners of the town's magnificent estates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But their servants were, for the most part, on hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The jails had not been able to hold them all. Out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thousand souls that heard the giant's final demand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely one out of ten was in sympathy with the gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment--Daly Fosburgh's government, so to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The general stood on his own veranda, not far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot where the giant's right hand crushed the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some yards away from the financier, on the lawn, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bert, taking in the scene with a curious air of detach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Although out of prison, he still maintained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">original attitude towards the problem. However it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended, he must lose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Florence, as soon as the giant spoke his ultimatum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as she learned that her former master was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed to a horrible death, disappeared.

And no one else had noticed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bert let the matter stand for a moment. He asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father the only possible question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you made up your mind what you are going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do, sir?" Bert's inquiry might have related to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">golf game, instead of to the most awful act that a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be asked to perform. To nourish that giant! To</seg><seg type="columnLine">feed that huge maw! But-- "Are you going to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">him what a Fosburgh is made of, dad?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The aristocrat's eyes were heavy with agony. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the question he was asking himself, as he gazed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror upon the waiting face of the colossus, looming</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a barrier between the house and the sea. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">should he, Daly Fosburgh, do in such a case? Presum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably, if the commander in chief himself were to volun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teer, the giant's wrath might soon be appeased. Should</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, a Fosburgh, be the first to sacrifice himself?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I -- don't know," he faltered. "I don't know, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The monster's voice crashed forth again. "IT IS UP</seg><seg type="columnLine">TO YOU--EITHER YOU VOLUNTEER, YOU WHO</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOUGHT ME, OR I SHALL RUN YOU DOWN!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"YOU HAVE JUST ONE MINUTE TO DECIDE,</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHETHER YOU DIE LIKE MEN, OR--LIKE RATS!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The seconds dragged by. No one could move, or make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sound. From moment to moment Bert glanced at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father; but the patrician, torn between pride and unsel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishness, could not decide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the rest of the people of his type, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at the giant, they were equally incapable of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponse. Not one had nerve enough to lead the wayp</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NTH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">225</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to start voluntarily the process of healing the giant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of outrage. It was the thing to do--but none</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant raised his head, and looked around again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"YOUR LAST CHANCE," said he. "ONE SECOND</seg><seg type="columnLine">MORE."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A breathless suspense; and then, with a sudden mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, the giant reached out and snatched the president</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fingers of his left hand. The man, helpless as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fly in that terrible grasp, seemed paralyzed with fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The giant leaned back on his haunches and roared, above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cry of horror and dread that arose from all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "RUN, YOU RATS--RUN! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant dropped the president from one hand into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. Out flashed a huge, red tongue, and the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">second would have been the president's last, but for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most extraordinary thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  An expression of unutterable surprise swept over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant's face. He sat stock still, holding his hands before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; and stared in pure astonishment at the tip of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallest finger of his right hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There, crawling out of the crevice between that</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous finger-nail and the leathery skin, was the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of a woman. She grabbed the edge of the nail;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a final effort, drew herself up on top of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a gnat might balance itself on her own finger-nail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Florence Neil. Somehow, while the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested his right hand on the ground, she had contrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">to crawl into that gaping crevice. And now she found</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself a mile in the air, within hailing distance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nth Man's ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are making a great mistake!" she screamed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't make food of these men! It's the worst pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible thing you could do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Her voice, shrill as a whistle, carried down clearly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. And her people stared, astounded, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant, even more astounded, made a stuttering reply:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "WELL! YOU HAVE A NERVE, LITTLE ONE!</seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT--YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING WORTH</seg><seg type="columnLine">LISTENING TO!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You just don't understand!" stormed Florence, find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it difficult to get enough air at that altitude, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperation lending her extraordinary powers. "Let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you--what I mean!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most of the men--you propose to eat--are not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame for their acts!

You must not punish an army--for th#</seg><seg type="columnLine">sins of one man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "YOU MEAN, DALY FOSBURGH?" with a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On his veranda, the general stood as though paralyzed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He is there in plain sight--and it is he, alone, who--</seg><seg type="columnLine">should suffer!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At the same time, I happen to know--that you can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not eat him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What did she mean? A pause for breath, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is my--employer! I have seen--your history,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mister Giant! And I know--you can't take vengeance</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon--his body!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't enforce your demand! Let things stand--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are! With that man's billions confiscated--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new law--America's future will be perfectly safe!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was the most remarkable speech in all history. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant knew it. And he knew that the girl had matched</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation with sensation, had appealed to him in a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">that none appreciated quite as well as he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Down on the lawn in front of his home, Bert Fosburgh</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared upwards in blank amazement. Behind him, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father stood, just as amazed, but with another and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">totally different emotion surging within him, as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant quit staring at the girl. He looked off</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the south, hooding his eyes with those enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous shields as he thought and pondered over what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Florence had said. Presently he turned his head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Florence once more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, very carefully and with the utmost gentleness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tilted his finger so that she could slide down, safely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his other hand. He placed the president on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, and then held Florence up even with his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "FOR YOU, LITTLE ONE; YES! I SHALL SPARE</seg><seg type="columnLine">THESE COWARDS!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"AND AS FOR DALY FOSBURGH--LET HIM</seg><seg type="columnLine">KEEP HIS LIFE, AND GIVE UP HIS FORTUNE. IT</seg><seg type="columnLine">IS ENOUGH.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "YOU WIN, LITTLE ONE."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he set her down, as though she were a humming-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird's egg in the hands of a child. She nearly fainted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sudden change of air; but she looked up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow managed to smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant smiled in return. "FOR YOU!" he cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartily. "YOU NERVY LITTLE MITE!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, with a single warning glance at the crowd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant turned and strode west. In two minutes he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INSIDE a week, the truth about the Nth Man was told.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The data contained in the metal chest he had left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when compared with certain other information, rounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his simple history in a manner that satisfied all</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity. It amounted to this, no more:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in 1909, a young man named George Pendleton</seg><seg type="columnLine">was attending the California Medical College in San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco. He was then within a few months of matricu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating, and, being wholly without any independent income,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was still obliged to earn his living while keeping up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his studies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He earned it by driving a car, a fine limousine, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of eight possessed by the Parkhurst family.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This car was used exclusively by Miss Dorothy, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngest of three heiresses to the great wealth and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viable social position of Cynthia Parkhurst. And Pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dleton was but one of a half dozen chauffeurs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, the pay was good enough to enable him, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">care and an occasional professional "pick-up," to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">him through school. He had his mornings free, by special</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangement attending only forenoon classes. After-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noons and evenings were at Miss Dorothy's disposal. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrived to do his reading at odd moments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But most certainly his pay was not enough to justify</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in considering the notion of marriage, nor even of</seg><seg type="columnLine">courtship. Such matters must wait, he had told himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he had his diploma and had returned to the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior town where a practice, made up of a wide circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of friends, was almost eagerly awaiting him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All he needed was patience, and for nearly eight years</seg><seg type="columnLine">his supply had served. And meanwhile he drove that</seg><seg type="columnLine">car with all the imperturbable qualities, combined with</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful mechanics, that the most exacting mistress could</seg><seg type="columnLine">expeet. And Miss Dorothy was exacting. But Pendleton</seg><seg type="columnLine">really was a clever driver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was just one flaw in his plans. He failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take into account that Miss Dorothy, in the years that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had served her, had been steadily growing out of girl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood and into the full bloom of woman's estate. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually had the change come, Pendleton had not no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed it. Also, he failed to realize that, all in all, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Miss Dorothy were necessarily in one another's</seg><seg type="columnLine">company more often than either was in the company of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other person of the opposite sex.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, Dorothy's mother was an aristocrat of the aris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tocrats. Her servants--some thirty in number--were</seg><seg type="columnLine">226</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">merely so many necessary evils in her sight. She des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pised them all. And her daughters had the same creed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That is, all save Dorothy. The younger of the Park-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurst family was proud enough, but she was also far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighted and imaginative. She could see that, in a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less, her chauffeur was due to become a legally au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorized physician, and as such entitled to the respect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">society. And she was amazed to discover, upon thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over, that of all men who had ridden at her side in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own or any other car, none had a fraction of the manly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent qualities of the fellow on the front seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he seemed totally unaware of her good opinion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She did not know that he, who had first taken the job</seg><seg type="columnLine">with some nervousness because of having "to protect a</seg><seg type="columnLine">child," had grown to love her with all his heart. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself did not realize it. She was, in his preoccupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, merely a beautiful child, when one day the inevi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dorothy, having instructed Pendleton to drive her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country, ordered him to stop at a certain spot on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the La Honda road. She wished to pick some wildflowers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said. And, since this was a comparatively informal</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion, there was no footman beside the chauffeur.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man and woman were alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pendleton helped Dorothy over the fence, and stood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">respectfully waiting, until she returned from the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the hillside. It is doubtful if either of them had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest inkling of what was about to happen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Dorothy returned, her anus laden with flowers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she found it much harder to get over the fence, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it meant going downhill. There was just one thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do; and Pendleton, climbing part way up the fence, locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs around a post and held out his arms, imperson-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, to lift this "child" back down to the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spot was deserted, except for these two. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">next instant Dorothy Parkhurst, amazed but blissful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was crushed tight to the breast of George Pendleton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally amazed and equally blissful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They had a long and a wonderful talk, that afternoon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They agreed that their affair must be kept secret until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pendleton's graduation. After that, all should be well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that day forth Dorothy developed a sudden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">devouring interest in nature. She bought a small lib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rary of volumes dealing with trees, flowers, birds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even minerals. Her social obligations suffered. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pendleton didn't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Winter passed, and spring came. Pendleton learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would have to take some extra work in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">matriculate. And during the summer Dorothy left San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco, going far up into Humboldt county, where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a true woman of the outdoors. For many months</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lovers did not see one another; but each wrote every</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, without fail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was towards the end of October that Cynthia Park-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurst, having written letter upon letter without succeed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in arousing Dorothy to a sense of her social duties,</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that she must visit the girl in person. The visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">was planned as a surprise. And it found Dorothy unpre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mother could not be deceived. And, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy had hoped that she could keep her secret just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little longer--George's diploma was due within a week</seg><seg type="columnLine">--she was obliged to confess to her mother. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been secretly married. And the child was coming within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very few days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Parkhurst's pride was cut to the quick. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorothy--and a mere chauffeur! In vain did Dorothy</seg><seg type="columnLine">plead that Pendleton's degree, so soon to be achieved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would alter everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even Dorothy did not know her mother's heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Parkhurst's pride was not a pride of intellect; hers</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a pride of birth. There were innumerable M.D.'s;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there could be only one Parkhurst family. To Dorothy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother, a physician was merely a very highly paid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very finely trained servant; much above the average</seg><seg type="columnLine">servitor, to be sure, but--a servant, as compared with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parkhurst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the mother, disowning her daughter absolutely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the place with the spoken vow that George Pendleton</seg><seg type="columnLine">would pay heavily for his insolence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THUS it happened that, on the very eve of his matricu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation, George Pendleton was informed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">"through charges of irregularity in your private life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which nullify your otherwise excellent ethical standing,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not be given his diploma. Also, he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred from entering any other college. Mrs. Parkhurst</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought a certain very powerful influence to bear;</seg><seg type="columnLine">an influence which will shortly be explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pendleton knew there could be but one reason in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world for such an accusation. Obviously, Dorothy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret was out. And he lost no time in rushing north as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast as the transportation methods of that day would</seg><seg type="columnLine">allow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pendleton reached the little resort on the morning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">November first. He rushed straight to the little cottage</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Dorothy, in company with a former schoolmate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been occupying. And When Pendleton knocked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, it was opened by the other girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're too late," she told him, in a hushed voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dashed inside. And there on her bed lay his wife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying. She had taken poison, and she expired even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he raised her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An opened letter from Dorothy's mother told what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to Pendleton. So Dorothy had known. And a</seg><seg type="columnLine">note in her own hand explained why she had taken her</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had expected, once she was the wife of Dr. Pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dleton, to go back to her people with her pride intact.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, all this was impossible. Moreover, she could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of burdening George, whose career had been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly blasted on her account, with the care of one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom life now meant so little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pendleton's training had schooled him, in a measure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to things like this. He recovered rather quickly. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a few minutes before he made a great resolve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sent Dorothy's companion in a hurried search for</seg><seg type="columnLine">help. As good luck would have it, there were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained nurses on their vacations at the resort. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">most experienced of these was brought; and between her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pendleton, who was a doctor in every sense except</seg><seg type="columnLine">the legal one--between them, the Caesarean operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was performed, and the infant saved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This child, a boy, was named Park Pendleton. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">young doctor brought to bear every device of science and</seg><seg type="columnLine">common sense, procuring the services of a foster mother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Spanish woman who had recently been widowed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby progressed quite as well as his normally-born foster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his prospects for a professional career com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely gone, George Pendleton saw that he must either</seg><seg type="columnLine">change his indentity or leave the country. In the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did both; and, after having discounted for cash his</seg><seg type="columnLine">share in a certain litigated estate, he took the Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, together with the two children and disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some weeks later a certain Dr. Park, accompanied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his "wife" and two children, arrived in the Galapagos</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islands. Perhaps it should be mentioned that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands are a group of thirteen, located five or six hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred miles west of South America, directly under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">equator. Although now internationalized, they at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time belonged to Equador. And there the Park "family"</seg><seg type="columnLine">made its home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Being a Californian, the doctor possessed more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smattering of Spanish, and his Latin served to make him</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NTH MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">227</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a very welcome and adaptable addition to the Galapagan</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonies. None but native doctors were there before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; small wonder, with a population of less than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand. But the standard of living was easy, prices</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, and the doctor found the place to be ideal for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying out of his resolve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Young Park Pendleton, to give him his true name, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought up differently from any other infant since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world began. Until one year of age, it is true, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed on human milk. But when he reached that age he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was weaned. And, while he began to eat and digest his</seg><seg type="columnLine">food after the manner of other humans, at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain elements of his nourishment were not assimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated in that fashion, but were injected, in condensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, directly into his veins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As for this peculiar food, it is first necessary to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribe the thing for which the Galapagos Islands are</seg><seg type="columnLine">most widely known. By this is meant the giant turtles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of which are to be found in zoos throughout the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. These turtles, or rather, Iand-tortoises, are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest known to science, growing to such immense size</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they will support the weight of a full-grown man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Moreover, these tortoises, whose food (before they be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came extinct on the Galapagos) was cacti and coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasses, are remarkable in other ways. For one thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they live to an enormous age; some of those in captivity</seg><seg type="columnLine">are known to be over three hundred years old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Also, it appears that they grow as long as they live.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They never seem to stop growing. Nevertheless, lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gevity and continuous growth are not all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They possess incredible vitality. The experiments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sr. Redi, an Italian surgeon, show that a Galapagos</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island tortoise can live for months after the brain has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been removed! Incredible though this may seem, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is a more startling fact: The triple heart of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tortoise, twenty-three days after the head was cut off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to beat!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THESE experiments were known to Dr. Pendleton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he was also aware of certain other discoveries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat in advance of his time. For instance, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the thyroid and parathyroid glands of animals are</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vast importance in the matter of growth. The pitui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary gland, located at the base of the brain, he also</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew to be inseparably connected with the development of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great size in animals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now, the one-year-old boy became a living experiment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Into his veins was injected the chemical elements which</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the vital glands of the Galapagos tortoise. People</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to wonder why these turtles were killed off. Today,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they may know.	__</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For Park Pendleton became the Turtle Man. He dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered from the unwieldy creatures in almost all respects;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was a finely developed, sturdy baby, with all the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tellectual and physical possibilities of the highest type</seg><seg type="columnLine">of human. But in one or two respects, he became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortoise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For one, he grew much larger than ordinary children.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also--because the glands were used as often as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">child's system could stand the injection--whereas an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary turtle would live a lifetime on a single set of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glands, the infant was presented with fresh secretions</seg><seg type="columnLine">every few days. And consequently the boy grew with</seg><seg type="columnLine">much greater speed than any turtle; faster, in fact, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any organism of the globe had ever grown before!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Doctor," George Pendleton had once asked a professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the college;" doctor, is it true that the average infant</seg><seg type="columnLine">is about seven-and-a-half pounds at birth? '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Yes; that is the average."	.. ,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Is it also true that the average infant will triple</seg><seg type="columnLine">its weight inside of a year?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Usually. They weigh around twenty-two, at twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">months."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well--I know it's a foolish question, doctor, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may lead to something--why is it that a human infant</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't continue to triple its weight every year?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor looked astonished. Then, the novelty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the proposition was borne home to his imagination,</seg><seg type="columnLine">.and he contemplated the problem in all seriousness. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There really is no good reason, Pendleton, why an</seg><seg type="columnLine">infant shouldn't triple its weight the second year, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third, and each succeeding year. No good reason, gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally speaking; but when you narrow it down to a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">infant, then, of course, nature simply will not do it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">without assistance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Pendleton never forgot. So, although the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a source of amazement and mystery to everyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">else, the young doctor was not surprised at what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The boy tripled in weight the first year, quite as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">average infant does. That is, he weighed about twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">two pounds when one year old. But, thanks to the treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment which his father administered, the lad likewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripled his weight the second year. That made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight, sixty-six pounds. And the third year his growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded at the same rate, so that he was one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ninety-eight at its close.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As he increased in weight, he also increased in width,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickness and height. He was normally proportioned;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was different only in relative size. At three, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish foster-brother stood just two feet and nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches; Park was already nearly twice as tall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The treatment continued. Every available turtle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the islands was sacrificed. To get the glands, the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been hard-pressed for means, had he not dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that the creatures yielded an excellent oil. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">a demand for this oil was developed, the natives slaught-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the tortoises right and left, delivering the desired</seg><seg type="columnLine">organs to the doctor at the rate of a dozen for a sucre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At four, Park Pendleton was nearing six hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds. He was not far from a ton, at five, and over ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in height. Also, his skin had already begun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">harden, like a turtle's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mentally, he was merely a child; that is, so far as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment went. But he possessed a prodigious memory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite in keeping with his enormous skull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, at six years, we find that the boy must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed nearly three tons, so that, at seven, the figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been eight tons or more. Already his father</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been obliged to lease the smallest of the islands for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his exclusive use, keeping the curious away by drastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">measures. In this way, the boy's phenomenal growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was kept from the rest of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Park weighed three times as much, at eight, as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">at seven. This made him about twenty-four tons. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine, his weight was seventy-two; at ten, two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sixteen. He then stood almost exactly fifty feet tall;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the year 1920--And this marks the date when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first of the "colossal Mysteries" occurred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Early in that year the doctor had decided that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a reckoning with his boy. The lad realized, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, that he wos totally different from any other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now, for the first time, he was to be told the reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">why.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You owe your life," the father began, "to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother, and to me. To me, however, you owe even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to your mother, for you would never have seen this</seg><seg type="columnLine">world had it not been for my skill." And he explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Caesarean operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then Pendleton told his boy of his tragic love affair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As clearly as he could, he explained Cynthia Parkhurst's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous pride, and how it had forced her to disown</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own daughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that is not all," bitterly. "She prevented me</seg><seg type="columnLine">228</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from getting my diploma! She did it, my boy, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cowardly use of a peculiar influence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This influence would be hard for you to understand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at your age. I shall write out an explanation, for you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read when you are ten years older. It is enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that Cynthia Parkhurst prevailed upon Daly Fos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burgh to bring pressure to bear on the regents of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">college.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This pressure was of a financial nature. And that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, 'finance,' brings me to the point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My boy, Daly Fosburgh is a great menace to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States. Today, he secretly controls enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">amounts of wealth. Year by year his control is being</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended, until the time must come when he shall possess</seg><seg type="columnLine">a controlling interest in every enterprise in the nation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''It is inevitable. I have worked it out with calculus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When you are old enough, you shall trace every step of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the calculation, and see that I am right. In time, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States will be dominated by that one man--Daly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fosburgh,--who prevented me from graduating, and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the indirect cause of your mother's death!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor paused for breath, before going on:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, I am going to exact a promise from you, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy." The father was standing on top of a high cliff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order that he might gaze straight into his gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's eyes, "a promise, based upon the fact that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be dead, were it not for me, and upon the further</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that your mother would be alive today, were it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Daly Fosburgh!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want you to promise me, that when you grow up--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceive of it!--"when you reach the age of twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">three, you shall take vengeance upon the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused the death of your mother, and who ruined your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's life!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy was made solemn by it all. For the first time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his manliness was aroused. From that time forth he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no longer a boy, but a young man, in his viewpoint.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he gave his father the promise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(&lt;T WILL promise you," he boomed across to Pendle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 ton. "It shall be my purpose in life, to get even</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Daly Fosburgh!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you want me to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Pendleton went on to outline the plan. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">based upon the doctor's careful computations. By 1933</seg><seg type="columnLine">--when the boy should reach the age of twenty-three--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daly Fosburgh must, inevitably, own a controlling inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est in the United States. And it was obvious that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would then be, whether secretly or openly, the dictator</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your work shall be, my boy, to put an end to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">financial system which has permitted one man to gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">such power! I shall write out complete instructions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you to read later. By following them, you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy one-man rule in America!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thus the affair really began, thirteen years be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the Nth Man first set foot on North America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor had already found it impossible to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer use tortoise glands. Enough could not be had.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead, he had analyzed the food of the creatures, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the chemical combination which produced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretion, and finally traced these chemicals down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the volcanic soil of the islands themselves. Next, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting up a smelting plant, the doctor was able to sepa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate these elements from the rock, and afterwards dupli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate the combinations he required.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the growing boy was, at the age of ten, already</seg><seg type="columnLine">depending directly upon minerals for his development.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His diet had even then become reduced necessarily, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea food almost without exception. And he was begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to test his powers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the summer of that year when he took his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">long trip through the ocean, reaching Santa Cruz, far to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the north, in time to effect the mysterious rescue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Florence Neil. Once or twice he was nearly discovered;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he learned to hold his breath even longer than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">turtle, and so escaped by diving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At eleven years, Park Pendleton weighed six hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forty-eight tons. At twelve, he weighed almost two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand, and stood a hundred and thirty-three feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">high. No wonder he had little difficulty in placing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge boulder on the deck of the Cristobel, in 1922.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At thirteen he was about six thousand tons; at four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen, he was seventeen thousand, and was not far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred feet high. It was child's play for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">play that trick with the Sphinx; child's play, in more</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses than one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He weighed more than fifty thousand tons at fifteen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A year later he was over a hundred and fifty thousand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a height of six hundred and thirty feet. Thus, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief problem in removing the Zollverein Internationale</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank was to avoid detection. The stunt itself was easy.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At seventeen--when boys are at their most awkward</seg><seg type="columnLine">age--Park weighed nearly five hundred thousand tons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This brought him up to a million and a half at eighteen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1928, with a height of fourteen hundred feet. It will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be noted that his height did not triple; it varied, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to the cube root of his weight, since he grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">in width and depth at the same time he was lengthening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his size, in 1928, was such that he kept almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely to the water, finding relief from observation</seg><seg type="columnLine">only on such barren lands as the Australian desert. Small</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder that he was interested in the Mammoth III and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her precious cargo; and small wonder likewise, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to perform this feat. Fourteen hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall! He carried the freighter gripped in one hand, high</seg><seg type="columnLine">above his head, as he made his way through the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time he was nineteen, he weighed four and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half million tons; by twenty, thirteen and a half million,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a height of three thousand feet. Fortunately, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea swarmed with food. Otherwise, in that year 1930,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would never have been able to destroy the Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wall overnight, and have thereby relieved the great na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion from the thralldom of its past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the next three years, he continued to grow as</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. At twenty-one he weighed four million; at</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-two, a hundred and twenty million, with a length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sixty-four hundred feet. Finally, at twenty-three,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a boy ordinarily stops growing--at twenty-three,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Park Pendleton also ceased to grow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He then stood, as the world now knows, very nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine thousand, one hundred and ninety-eight feet high,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is only a little less than two miles--with the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceivable weight of three hundred and sixty million</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons. He was coated all over with the bony armor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tortoise. In all other respects, he was proportioned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man of six feet and two hundred pounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for his judgment, that was neither more nor less</seg><seg type="columnLine">mature than most well educated young men of that age.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But his memory was absolutely unthinkable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For, in sober truth, the Nth Man knew everything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was not one fact, of any consequence, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not actually know "by heart." His knowledge was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of every encyclopedia his father possessed, of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">textbook, of every possible source of information. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">father died; but the son possessed wireless apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own, set up on the barren snows of Antarctica.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He kept constantly in touch with everything that hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. Not one important fact escaped him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that there is nothing so very remarkable about him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood off by herself. And it was she who was speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was scared almost to death!" she declared, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching the end of her account of her unprecedented</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure.

Her hair was lustrous bronze and her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as blue as the Caribbean water along the shore. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dressed in a plain gown of white linen; her feet were</seg><seg type="columnLine">encased in canvas shoes, and she wore a broad Panama.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But her walk!

As soon as Meredith</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that I had spent a great deal of time in South</seg><seg type="columnLine">America, he gave me all his attention and, having a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon interest, we soon were chatting away like old</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends.

But all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time that we were talking, in the back of my head I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wondering who Miss Meredith was, and why she</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke that strange dialect. I didn't feel well enough ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted to ask personal questions, and I didn't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear rude or curious. But at last Meredith himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the matter up. He had just repeated in the odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue, something I had said, and then, turning to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he apologized for speaking in a language unintelligible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, remarking by way of explanation, that Miss Mere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dith did not readily understand English as she had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently learned to speak it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'She speaks it charmingly,' I replied.

'As I recollect it, not one of her crew or</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers escaped.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Among the passengers,' continued Meredith, 'was my</seg><seg type="columnLine">motherless two year-old daughter Ruth, in charge of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted nurse. The shocking news reached me at Caura,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I at once led a searching party to the scene of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster. But not a survivor could be found, not even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">body could be recovered. The perai fish and alligators</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed all evidences of the victims' fate. In an effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forget my awful loss, I resumed my former profession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of field naturalist, and for the next fifteen years I spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life in the bush. Often, of course, I penetrated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown and unexplored districts, and on my last trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found myself in a remote region upon one of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest rivers fully three hundred miles from the coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from all traces of civilization. My only companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">were my two boatmen; Pepe, a pure blooded Indian, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jos6, a mestizo. Everything had gone smoothly and with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out any unusual incident, and as the river narrowed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current quickened, we realized that we were ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching the highlands and the limits of navigable</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Suddenly P6pe, in the bow, stopped paddling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held up his hand for silence. Then, as we floated motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, we caught the faint sounds of human voices from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond a wooded point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Slowly and cautiously we moved forward to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen of branches and peered through the foliage. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the point, the stream swept in a half-circle along</seg><seg type="columnLine">a narrow beach under a bank crowned with huge trees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upon the beach were a number of dug-outs, and upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank were a dozen or more thatched huts. Here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there the naked forms of Indians were visible, and beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest canoe were two men, one braiding a bark</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope; the other daubing pitch on the craft. It was their</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices we had heard, but the dialect was strange to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently P6pe turned. "It' is well, Senor," he whisp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered. "They speak the Metaki and are my people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'As he finished, he shouted words in his own tongue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we paddled into view. As we emerged from our hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing place, each of the Indians on the beach grasped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowgun and stood ready to use his poisoned darts if</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity arose. But a few words from P6pe reassured</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; the weapons were laid aside, and as our canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the shore, the two savages grasped the gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wales and rushed it up the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Instantly all was commotion in the village, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stepped ashore, we were surrounded by a crowd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chattering, wondering Indians of both sexes and all ages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it was the first time they had ever seen civilized men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To their innumerable comments and questions, Pepe re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied in his own language. Presently Jos6, too, was talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, using a distinct dialect, which the Metakis seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Now and then I could catch a word, but most of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unintelligible to me, and, addressing P6pe and Jos6,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked them if none of the Indians could speak any</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialect I knew. At my words, scowls and black looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread over the faces of some of the men, and I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had understood my words and-were suspicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they heard Spanish.

Stepping nearer to examine them--for quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequently rare or new birds may be found among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians' ornaments, I saw, among the ordinary toucan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">parrot and macaw feathers, a bunch of plumes of won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful purple. They were unlike anything I had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, and I knew instantly that they were from some un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">described species of bird.

But Melanga's yarn of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, monkey-men, and a singing river was, I mentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided, merely the Indian's love for adding imaginary</seg><seg type="columnLine">frills to a story and perhaps mixed with a little supersti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. At any rate. I had already decided to go after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waupona, and I told Melanga of my intention.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'The old fellow looked really sad.

Both he and Melanga agreed that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the trip was long and arduous, mainly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest, until a large river was reached, which was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed for three days.

For four days we tramped steadily through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest, throughout that time gradually ascended towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior highlands. On the morning of the fifth day</seg><seg type="columnLine">we entered a thicker jungle, and in the afternoon heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of running water. Presently we came out upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the banks of a good sized river. It was a swift flowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream without rapids as far as could be seen, and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent for our purpose. There was abundant material</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a raft at hand, and as soon as camp was made we</seg><seg type="columnLine">began preparations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'The next two days were occupied in building a raft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in doing which we used the light, cork-like balsa trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound together with lianas and floored with bamboo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And on the third day we embarked. The craft floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and buoyantly and sped down-stream with gratify-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing speed. For six days we floated along swiftly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily, and on the seventh day Tinana assured me that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days more we could go ashore and in four days we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reach the valley of the Waupona birds. Fortunately</seg><seg type="columnLine">we met no bad rapids, and at the allotted time we ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raft ashore and resumed our tramp through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest. The first day the way led across rocky ridges and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through deep canons filled with a mass of tangled vines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sawgrass, thorn-trees and cactus, where we had to cut a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail as we proceeded. The next day was even worse;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ascent became constantly sharper, the jungles more</seg><seg type="columnLine">impenetrable, while we frequently waded streams of ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold mountain water. By nightfall, we had reached an</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitude so great that we shivered with cold despite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring fire in the small cavern where we camped. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worst of the trip was over, and Tinana told me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">only two more days remained between us and the valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Early the next morning we crossed the highest ridge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains, with several snow-capped peaks in sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rapidly descended the farther slope. The jungle soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced the scanty vegetation of the higher altitudes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air became warmer, and by night we were again in</seg><seg type="columnLine">open forest and a tropical climate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Soon after noon the next day, Tinana showed signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of uneasiness and stopped now and then to peer ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and about, searching the earth with his keen eyes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening intently to every sound. He was evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous. The Metakis kept their blowguns in readiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instant use, and I felt a tingle of excitement, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized we were in hostile country and nearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunts of the Waupona and Melanga's mythical monkey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. But it was mid-afternoon when Tinana crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, and with a gesture for silence, beckoned to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crawling to his side, where he squatted behind a dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluster of vines, I peered out through the foliage in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction he indicated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'At our feet the earth ended in a sheer precipice, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its foot, fully a thousand feet below, and stretching</seg><seg type="columnLine">for miles into the distance, was a great sunlit valley that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed like a sea of blood.

OR a long time I gazed fascinated at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">H great red valley, and could scarcely credit</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own senses. It seemed so incredible. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed like some weird dream, or such a scene as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">might expect to see on Mars. At last Tinana touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arm and suggested that we delay no longer, but at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to descend to the valley right away. This task</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared impossible. The spot where we stood was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge of a precipice, obviously impassable. Crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">back a few yards, Tinana led us by a circuitous route</seg><seg type="columnLine">until we came to the edge of a large lake surrounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest. The upper end of the lake was lost among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, but near us, the lower end washed against a rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge. There seemed no outlet to the lake, but dim and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint in the distance, I heard the roar of falling water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Through a thick tangle, Tinana led the way to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough steep gorge, and as we slipped and picked our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way along the declevity, I now and then caught brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpses of the red valley through the intervening foliage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Constantly, too, the roar of the waterfall became louder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently, as we rounded a turn in the trail, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cataract. Before us, and towering for hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above the valley, rose a sheer rock wall, and half way</seg><seg type="columnLine">up its face, a great white column of water rushed out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward through a tunnel-like opening in the solid cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'Straight into the air it spouted for nearly a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, to spread and fall in a great fan-shaped dazzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass to the valley far below. It was an awe-inspiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight--this great scimitar of water bathed in a veil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist, and forced with irresistible power through a fissure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the precipice. But I could not see that we were any</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer a solution of the problem of reaching the valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that we were now within a few hundred feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red trees instead of the thousand feet that had sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arated us when we had first viewed the weird spot. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had not yet reached the end of our descent. Directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">under that roaring, terrific mass of outflung water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tinana led on, until at last, he halted on a broad terrace</seg><seg type="columnLine">or ledge covered with jungle and barely one hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the valley with its scarlet-leaved trees. Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">screened from possible observation from below, Tinana</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained that it would be necessary to make a ladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vines in order to desccnd. No doubt a single tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">liana dropped over the cliff would have served him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellows, but the Indians knew that it was beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers of any white man to slide down or clamber up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailing vine for a hundred feet, and all started at work</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fashion a rude though serviceable rope ladder of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong lianas that everywhere draped the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'It was slow work, and as the Indians busied them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, I crept to the cliff edge and studied the valley. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see no signs of human beings; no huts, no smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bespoke inhabitants. No animals appeared upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open swales of green among the trees, and I felt con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that Melanga had drawn upon his imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had spoken of the 'monkey-men.' It seemed im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible that any human begins had once occupied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place and had moved away or died off since he made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">last journey to the Waupona country. But Tinana did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not share my views. He and the other Metakis were</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous, frightened, and insisted that some terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostile beings inhabited the valley. No fire was permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night, and despite all efforts, I began to feel nerv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous and on a tension myself, starting at every sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping badly, and having nightmarish dreams. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright morning sun dispelled my unwonted fears, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a careful scrutiny of the valley, Tinana and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows cautiously dropped the frail ladder over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge of the cliff. Then, half fearfully, Tinana com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced to descend. He reached the valley in safety,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up, and signalled for us to follow. Backing over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the precipice I, too, went down the ladder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despite the fact that Tinana had secured the lower end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing swayed horribly, and I marvelled that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever" have reached the bottom with the thing hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose. But a hundred feet is not far, and within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes we all stood together at the base of the cliff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing about us at the strange and bizarre trees with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their immense banner-like leaves of red. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge, gnarled and twisted, with innumerable pendent</seg><seg type="columnLine">roots like those of mangroves or banyans, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad-spreading crowns were so interlaced and tangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they formed an impenetrable roof above our heads.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From above, the place had seemed almost impossible, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weirdly strange and unnatural spot; but now that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood beneath the trees, I realized that, after all, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing so very strange or remarkable about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The trees, I saw, were some species of giant croton, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar in form and color of leaves to the ornamental</seg><seg type="columnLine">crotons grown in gardens, and hence in no way more re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable or unnatural than those red-leaved plants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"Suddenly, from seemingly near at hand, came an</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd musical sound, a note that rose and fell like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strumming of a guitar, and apparently issuing from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream that flowed near. The Indians started, drew to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, lifted their weapons, and cast frightened glances</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. But there was no sign of human beings within</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. It was the 'singing river' of Melanga, and as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized this, I laughed. Strange I had not thought of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner. It was a perfectly natural and not uncommon</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon, a sound produced by loose pebbles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones tinkling against one another as they were moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the current, and magnified by the water. I tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain this to the Indians, but I could see that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced the music was of supernatural origin. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">mestizo, Jos6, was the most nervous of all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"Suddenly my words were interrupted by a harsh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic cry from the tree tops, and instantly everyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled and stared in the direction whence the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. Among the branches there was a flash of dazzl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing purple, and upon a dead limb, in plain view, alighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most gorgeously beautiful bird I had ever seen. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly I knew it for a trogan, but a trogan three times</seg><seg type="columnLine">as large and a thousand times more vivid and wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">in color than even the famed Resplendent Trogan or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quetzal. From its head a great curved crest fell forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">over its beak and down its neck while, from above its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail, long, graceful fern-like plumes extended for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. From head to tail the creature was intense purple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming with hues of gold and violet as the light played</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon its plumage, while from shoulder to shoulder across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breast was a broad white band edged with crimson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the Waupona, truly the king of birds. All these de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails I took in at a glance. Cautiously I cocked my gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but before I could raise the weapon to my shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tanina had placed his blowgun to his lips; with a puff</seg><seg type="columnLine">of breath the tiny dart sped on its way and with flutter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wings the magnificent bird came tumbling to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Eagerly I dashed forward and picked up the won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful creature which I knew no other white man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen. As I examined the priceless specimen, mentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloating over my good fortune, the discordant scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of another Waupona issued from the tree tops, and as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled about, I caught a glimpse of a second purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird flashing away on whirring wings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Almost at the same instant there was a movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the scarlet leaves, and some large dark body</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed through the foliage. Almost involuntarily I</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised my gun and blazed away. At the report, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches bent and thrashed about, and a huge, black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ape-like creature came hurtling, crashing to the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly pandemonium broke loose above our heads, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams, cries and yells resounded from the tree-tops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE KING OF THE MONKEY MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">235</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">while the branches swayed and trembled as unseen, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible beings leaped and rushed among them.

Then, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated, not knowing which way to turn, a dart</seg><seg type="columnLine">whizzed by my face and struck quivering in the arm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Metaki beside me. I gasped. The things were hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. They used blowguns. Now I was terrified. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quick motion and a sharp cry of anger and despair, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian plucked the tiny arrow from his flesh and raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blowgun to his lips. Glancing upward, I saw a black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">demoniacal face glaring at us from between the branches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was but a momentary glimpse, but the brief instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its appearance was enough for the Metaki. His mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger of death sped unerringly and found its mark, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the sinister, horrible face drew back among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches, I saw the little shaft of palm stem imbedded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a black cheek, while a fierce cry of terror issued from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swollen lips. As the blow-gun dropped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of the stricken Metaki, a huge black form tumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the branches, hung for a moment by one limb, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then plunged to earth just as the Indian, with a last con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsive gasp, slumped like an empty bag to the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Terror now gripped all of us, and spurred us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad flight.

Then I noticed that the number of beings on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ledge had greatly increased. There were not more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than twenty who had come through the trees, yet now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ledge was fairly crowded with the strange creatures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All were chattering excitedly, and it was evident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who had brought me were telling their friends of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trip.

It was equally clear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the killing of the Waupona was an unpardonable offense</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a terrible crime, and that the king held me account-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able for it. But as the fellow who had brought the bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to explain, and with graphic gestures showed how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature had been killed by a blowgun in an Indian's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, the royal temper cooled a bit and the king listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently.

As far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I could judge, no reference was made to him, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon found I was mistaken.

Evidently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, this was a bit too miraculous a yarn for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">king to swallow. He had to be shown. Uttering a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">command, he pointed to the dead bird and then at me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the men lifted the dead bird tenderly, and carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it across the cave, placed it upon a jutting point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock.

Then as I glanced about, I saw by the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the smouldering fire, a calabash of water on the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I drained this and again slept. I was aroused by some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one moving about, and opened my eyes to see the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow who had led me to my cave. He was fanning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire into a blaze, and beside him was a plantain leaf on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were several strange fruits and a piece of meat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently he was about to serve my breakfast, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">fears of being starved were cast aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'When the fellow heard me move, he turned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned amiably and bobbed his head reassuringly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despite his ugliness he seemed a rather good-natured</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute, and the fact that he had brought food rather won</seg><seg type="columnLine">my liking for him.

However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we managed to get along on sign language, and he soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">served the half-cooked meat, meanwhile grimacing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kow-towing, twisting his broad black face into ludicrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">grins, and reminding me of an overgrown puppy trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make friends with a stranger. While I ate, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted before me, gazing fixedly up at me with an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of such wonder and curiosity in his little eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could not help laughing. He looked for all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world like some country lad watching the animals fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a managerie. Apparently my laughter delighted him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was quite happy to think that such a remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">being as myself should take any notice of him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">most important thing, it seemed to me, was to try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn a smattering of his dialect. Pointing to a fruit</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said, 'Fruit.' For a space he looked puzzled. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he caught the idea, grinned delightedly and muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Poot.'

My next attempt was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn his name. It was some time before I could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">my meaning clear on this point, but at last, striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breast, he said proudly 'Mumbai' repeating the word</seg><seg type="columnLine">several times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'All right, Mumba,' I laughed, and striking my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast, repeated my name; 'Henry.'

The pleasure of being in the air and sunshine</seg><seg type="columnLine">again was sufficient for the time being, and seating my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self upon a rock, I scrutinized the valley, trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate the spot where I had entered it and had first met</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monkey-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'There was little difficulty in finding the place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About two miles away the silvery flash of the column</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water could be seen, and from there I could follow;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the river's course to the spot where Tinana had killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Waupona.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" 'Still following the course of the stream with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, I was surprised to find that it apparently ended in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second towering cliff at the further end of the valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, on the side opposite to where I sat, a rock wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose sheer for fully a thousand feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'"The valley was completely surrounded by insur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountable barriers and its inhabitants were effectually</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut off from the rest of the world. No wonder, I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had remained so primitive, so distinct from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all other races and had developed such unique character-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istics. For all I knew, the beings might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolated here since their ancestors evolved from apes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But my speculations on such matters soon gave way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">more practical things. I noted that the ledge descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the valley, becoming narrower and narrower</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forming a mere trail or fissure in its course. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied it, I became certain that it would be possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow along it to the earth far beneath me. I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to try it. It was a precarious pathway, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I picked my way cautiously and gingerly. Several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found small gulleys or fissures which seemed to lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the valley, but each turned out to be a blind lead or</seg><seg type="columnLine">were too steep for human feet to descend. Still keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the main ledge I continued downwards, until at last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the throne-room, as I might call it. A few women and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children and one or two men were there and at my ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance the adults threw themselves on the floor, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the youngsters scuttled like frightened rats into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">black holes. I was received more like a god than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner, and no one made any attempt to interfere with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my movements. Unfortunately I had not the least idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which of the holes I had entered the cavern. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was as good as another and I remembered I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced the fire with the king's throne at my right when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had arrived. I chose the largest opening on that side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked cautiously along the dark tunnel. Either</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck was with me or else several entrances led to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">240</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I came to a spot where I could go no farther. Then, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time, I noticed something which had escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">me before. The tree from which the monkey-men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to the ledge was several feet higher than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot on which they had landed. They might leap from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tree to the ledge, but even the ape-like beings could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, I felt certain, leap up and across twenty feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. There must be another means of reaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley, and as I realized this, I heard voices from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath me. Very cautiously I peered over the cliff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almost directly beneath the spot where I stood, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey-woman was moving about, picking up fruits</seg><seg type="columnLine">from beneath a low tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'As I watched her, she half turned towards the cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">and uttered a shout as if calling to someone. In answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a low cry, and the next instant a monkey-man</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued from a fissure in the rock, scrambled down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few yards of broken stone and joined the woman. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">him followed another and another, until half a dozen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beings stood under the tree. As I watched them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they wrapped the fruits in leaves, secured the bundles</seg><seg type="columnLine">with vines, and began clamboring up the rock-strewn</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope to vanish at last in the fissure. My suspicions</seg><seg type="columnLine">were confirmed; there was another exit, and I determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find it. My plan was simple. No doubt, I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fruits would be carried to the main cabin, and, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided I could reach there first, I could see by which</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage the fruit-gatherers entered. Hurrying back up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ledge as rapidly as possible I reached the tunnel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed along this, and emerged in the main cave just</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time. Two men were crossing the floor carrying leaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped burdens, and a moment later, a woman and</seg><seg type="columnLine">several men appeared from a small opening in the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no doubt about the exit, but the cave was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well filled with people and I hesitated about attempting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make my way out. Better leave it until tomorrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">when there are few about, I decided. However, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid that I might forget whicii hole led to the valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the idea of making a rough sketch of the cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the location of the various openings occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Seating myself on a fallen piece of stalactite, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew out my note-book and pencil and began to draw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough plan of the cave. At first the savages cast fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened sidelong glances at me, as if fearing I was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to produce some magic, but as nothing happened, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">regained confidence, and drawn by the savage's insati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able curiosity, came closer and closer to me. Having</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed my hurried sketch of the cavern, I com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced sketching the men and women, and had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed a drawing of a woman roasting a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat over the fire, when one of the men glanced over</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulder and caught sight of what I was doing. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly he uttered a shrill cry, leaped back and poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a perfect torrent of excited words. Everyone rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, and jabbering and gesticulating, they crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me, craning their necks, peering at the page of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my book. All were tremendously excited. I had worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">another miracle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Tearing out the leaf with the drawing, I handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to the nearest monkey-man. Never had artist a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciative or enthusiastic audience, and the cries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration and wonder mingled with roars of laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the paper was passed from hand to hand. The noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently attracted the attention of those in the nearby</seg><seg type="columnLine">caves, for men and women appeared from every side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from each dark hole in the cavern walls. Then, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of the hubbub, I glanced up to see the king him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self approaching. So thoroughly engrossed were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people that they gave no heed to their monarch. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not even bother to kow-tow before him. For an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant he glowered, as if about to pronounce dire</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishment on all, and then, as one of the men handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the sketch, his expression underwent a most remark-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">able change, and incredulity and amazement spread over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hideous face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'For a time he studied it intently, and then, approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me, he made it quite clear by signs that he wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to make a picture of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Quite willingly, and smiling at the thought of at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempting to reproduce his ugliness adequately, I com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced sketching, while an awed silence fell upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled throng. No doubt it was a very inferior like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and of no artistic merit, for I lay no claims to being</seg><seg type="columnLine">a portrait artist. Still, if not flattering, it was unmis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takably the king--long beard, bristling hair, feather</seg><seg type="columnLine">crown and all. As I completed the rapid sketch, I tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">the page from my note book and handed it to the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arch. The expression upon his face, when he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">likeness, was so ludicrous that I shook with laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite my efforts to control my amusement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'The king examined the sketch carefully, lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and touched his crown, felt his hair, stroked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard and seemed mightily puzzled to find them all in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their proper places. For a moment he thought that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been transferred bodily to the paper. Then he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheet over, looked on the blank side and, utterly un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to solve the mystery, his grim, awed features broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a smile of self-satisfaction. He ran to his throne</seg><seg type="columnLine">and placed the paper upright on the seat. Then, squat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting before it, he gave himself up to admiring his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">portrait. It was the first time he had ever seen himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">as others saw him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'That I had risen tremendously in the estimation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the monkey-men was evident, for my ability as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist apparently, seemed fully as wonderful and super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural to these beings, as the exploding cartridge had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, though it lacked its terrifying qualities. So, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">being feared and regarded with a rather awed respect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found I had been transformed to a popular idol. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">popularity, however, had its drawbacks, for wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went the monkey-people crowded at my heels and fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed me about like a throng of small boys in the wake</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a famous baseball player. I was convinced, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, that I had no further cause to fear death or ill</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatment, for as long as I could perform such miracu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous feats and could please the crusty old king, or could</seg><seg type="columnLine">impress him and his subjects by transferring their like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses to paper, I was perfectly safe. I felt very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Mark Twain's Yankee hero must have felt at King</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arthur's Court, except that the king of the monkey-men</seg><seg type="columnLine">was several thousand years behind King Arthur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'I was amazed to find how exceedingly primitive these</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings were, because the fact that they used blowguns</seg><seg type="columnLine">had at first conveyed the idea that they were not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind other South American tribes. But I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">no signs of stone implements, no pottery, not a weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any sort--not even bows and arrows--and the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not learned to trace even the crudest of pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a burnt stick. Here were men and women who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were practically in the same condition as the ape-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancestors of man who dwelt in the rude caves of Europe</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless ages ago. Had I been among them of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own free will, and had I been free to leave when I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sired, I would have welcomed my opportunity to study</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind in the making, as it were. But all my thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were centered upon getting away from that red valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I hadn't the least ethnological interest in my hosts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was evident that I was quite free to wander</seg><seg type="columnLine">about wherever I saw fit. I entered the various tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nels and explored them, visited innumerable rooms or</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller caves and passages, and I discovered that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire mountain was fairly honeycombed with caverns</seg><seg type="columnLine">which provided chambers, passages and residences for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this strange cave-dwelling race. Every room was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habited, and I estimated that there must be fully one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand of the monkey-people dwelling there. Their life</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE KING OF THE MONKEY MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">241</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was of the simplest sort. The furnishings of their rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">consisted of piles of palm leaves, fires which were never</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted to die out, calabashes for utensils, rough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">river-worn cobbles and pieces of broken stone for pound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers and knives. For a time I was puzzled to know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">these people kindled their fires, but the riddle was solved</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I found one woman using a spindle of wood which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she twirled in her hands against a bit of dry and semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotten wood. To me the strangest thing was the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that while these people had discovered the blowgun, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not learned to make bows and arrows, I decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in all probability the former was discovered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident, for the monkey-men seemed far too stupid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have actually invented or reasoned out anything, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">since bows and arrows were not needed they had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit upon them. However, I mentally decided that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would amuse myself and kill no little time by teaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellows to use bows, and I foresaw a lot of fun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passing of dreary times in educating the savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">along various lines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'As I thought of this and walked idly about, I en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered a room where a man was skinning and cutting up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cavy by means of a jaggard sliver of stone, which served</seg><seg type="columnLine">more after the fashion of a dull saw than a knife. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I watched, wondering what he would say if I showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him my pocket knife, and I was on the point of taking it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my pocket when I thought better of it. Unques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionably the fellow would be terribly impressed, but also</seg><seg type="columnLine">unquestionably the king would be told of it and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">demand the knife for his own use. I had no intention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing the sole edged tool I possessed. But the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savage laboring with his bit of stone gave me an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other idea. I desired to show the monkey-men how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make really decent stone implements. The only trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, of course, that I had never made any myself, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a vague idea of how they were formed. I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians make arrow heads by both the chipping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire flaking methods, and I decided to try my hand at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this primitive art.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Moreover, my idea of showing the people bows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows had made me realize suddenly that I might need</seg><seg type="columnLine">such weapons myself, if I ever got away from the valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a knowledge of making stone arrow heads would</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve my own purposes as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Also, the sight of the fellow dressing his game had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded me that I was hungry, and, wondering a bit if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would be provided with food or would be expected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forage for myself, I retraced my way to the main cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thence to my own cave.

Come to think of it, I had not seen him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the crowd, and I realized that the fellow felt a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">slighted at not having seen his master working miracles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anxious to make him a firm friend and alley, I drew out</seg><seg type="columnLine">my note book and sketched the big chap as he squatted</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me. He fairly danced with delight when I handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the paper with the drawing, and he fawned upon me</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a grateful puppy. To him, of course, the sketch</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wealth untold, and to receive such a gift from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior being whom he served was an honor equal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bestowed upon the king. He could scarcely wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to finish my meal before scampering off to exhibit</seg><seg type="columnLine">his prize to his fellows, and if the mind of a monkey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man could hold such a thing as gratitude I felt sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mumba would now be my firm friend for life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Presently he came running back and by gestures</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me understand that I was to follow him.

It was soon clear that the king desired me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeat my drawing exhibition, and for the next hour or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more I was kept busy sketching monkey-people, birds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals, insects, trees and anything and everything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to my mind. Each time a sketch was finished, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed first to the king and then passed around.

But I soon realized that this sort of entertainment</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not go 011 indefinitely. My supply of paper was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting perilously low and would soon be exhausted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew that once I had used the last sheet and failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce the pictures, my status would be at an end and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all probability I would be at an end also. So, closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">my note book, I slipped it within my pocket and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave the cavern. This did not at all suit the king. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to be entertained, and in peremptory tones, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it quite clear that I was to continue drawing.

Throwing myself upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grass under the trees, I gave myself up to enjoyment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fresh air and soft breeze, listening to the chirping</seg><seg type="columnLine">of insects and the rotes of birds, and striving to be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful and contented as I could under the circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances. I had only been in the valley two days, yet it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed like weeks or months, and I realized that it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooved me to keep some sort of record of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'I could, of course, have written down each day in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">note book, but the paper was far too valuable for sketch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to permit me to do that and I busied my brain in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavor to think out some sort of calendar that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve my purpose. At last I decided upon knotted strings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each day I could tie a knot in a bit of fibre and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of seven days tie a knot twice the size of the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as long as I remembered that I had arrived on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wednesday the sixteenth, I could keep track of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">without trouble.

Then, raking the rock from the coals, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dipped a stick in my calabash of water and carefully let</seg><seg type="columnLine">a drop fall upon one edge of the hot stone. Instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a sharp click and a tiny flake of stone flew off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drop after drop was placed along the edges of the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as each touched the hot surface and flakes snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, the pebble began to assume definite form. Over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over again I heated the stone and dropped water upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, until at last I had the intense satisfaction of having</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashioned a crude trowel-shaped object which might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">served as a spear-head. The edges, however, were irreg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular and dull, but this was soon remedied by flaking first</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one side and then the other until a keen cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge resulted. And then, when I was congratulating my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self upon my success, a drop of water fell too far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge and with a sharp snap the stone broke squarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">in two. It was a depressing accident. Then suddenly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke into laughter to think how seriously I had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole matter. Had my life depended upon it, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have lost myself more completely in the task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Practice, however, made me almost perfect in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">art.

To be sure, no self respecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian of the stone age would have regarded the rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">irregular things I had made as worthy of the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">either weapons or tools, but they were far superior to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything possessed by the monkey-men, and I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">need to feel ashamed of my prehistoric art.

To me the jagged thing was a poor make-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift for a knife, even for fruit, but to Mumba, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never seen any edged tool except a natural sliver</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of rock, the implement was simply marvelous. I laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartily when I saw the fixed stare of wonder and awe</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his face, and handing him the flaked stone, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">signalled for him to try it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'As he half-fearfully took the bit of stone and tested</seg><seg type="columnLine">its edge, he yelled with delight.

He severed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit of palm leaf with it, half-whittled and half-cut a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick of firewood, and when, accidentally, he cut his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger and the blood flowed freely, he pranced and danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">about with inexpressible joy. A moment before he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">held only a tool, a wonderfully useful implement to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure--but merely useful for peaceful purposes.

After I had partly skinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature, I beckoned to the king to try his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To me, accustomed to steel implements, the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed hopelessly dull and almost useless. But to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black monarch, who had never known any sort of real</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged tool, the blunt stone affair was a marvel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with astonishing rapidity, he skinned and cut up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal. So interested and delighted were the people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I then and there started to show them how they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make stone tools and weapons for themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I heated pebbles and chipped them into form, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people squatted about absolutely fascinated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'But when, chuckling, I passed the calabash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, the stick and the hot stones to the king, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared with laughter at the expression on his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt he feared my magic might injure him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was no coward at heart and with a look of grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">determination to do or die, he took the proffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick, dipped it gingerly into the water and allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a drop to fall on the stone. Then, as the chip flew off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he leaped to his feet and yelled with glee.

Excellent mimics that they were, the monkey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had no sooner seen my weapons in use than they,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">too, began making bows and arrows.

In fact, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very much my masters in archery, despite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that I had practised constantly long before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first monkey-man's bow was completed. Also, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught them to make wooden handles for their stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools, and fearing I would exhaust my supply of paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had taught them to draw rude figures with charred</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticks on the walls of the caves. Several times, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, serious trouble had been narrowly averted. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the people still regarded me with superstitious</seg><seg type="columnLine">awe and respect, yet the king was madly jealous of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my prestige. At first the mere threat of a second ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion was enough to bring him to terms, but after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he had overcome his dread of this, and, on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion he demanded that I should give him my note</seg><seg type="columnLine">book. And when I refused and threatened to produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrifying magic of the fire, the king had flown into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rage and had ordered one of his men to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">book from me by force. For the fraction of a second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellow hesitated to obey and in that second I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed three of my cartridges into the fire. The series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of explosions that followed and thundered through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern had caused a perfect panic and had won the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'But my supply of cartridges was even more lim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited than my stock of paper, and realizing I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually rely upon other means for impressing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">king and his subjects, I kept my brains busy trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of some new stunt. Then one day I had an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiration and I marveled that the idea had not oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred to me sooner. I ran across a useless water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruined match in one of my pockets, and instantly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of making fire by means of flint and steel. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only trouble was I had neither flint nor steel. My only</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel available was my precious knife, which I dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not injure by such use, and the nearest approach to</seg><seg type="columnLine">flint was the jasper-like rock used for making stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">implements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'However, if I was to work this new magic, I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">take some risks, and I felt sure that somewhere I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find a stone that would serve in place of flint.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Picking up several of the discarded stone implements, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested each in turn by striking them with the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the larger blade of my knife. Some gave no sparks</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever, one or two produced sparks which I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">were far too small to ignite any tinder, but at last I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a bit of quartz which gave rise to a shower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright hot sparks from steel. The next and most im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant matter was to secure some tinder which could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be ignited by means of my sparks. I racked my brains</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to think of some highly inflammable material.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had often seen flint and steel used both by Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Latin Americans, but for the life of me I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember what tinder had been employed. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked myself for a stupid ass, as I remembered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">every-day flint and steel affairs used throughout South</seg><seg type="columnLine">America and in which a braided cotton wick served as</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinder. Not only was there an abundance of cotton in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley, but I possessed quite a stock of the material</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my own ragged garments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"To ravel out some of the threads and to braid</seg><seg type="columnLine">these into a loosely stranded cord or wick was a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. But to my utter disappointment, the cotton</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be ignited by the sparks. I was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give up in despair and decided that the cotton was</seg><seg type="columnLine">either the wrong kind or else that the natives treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs with some chemical, when I bethought myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">of testing whether my cotton wick would actually burn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I touched it to the flames of my fire and it blazed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite brightly.

Possibly, I thought, the cotton had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly damp, too damp to ignite by means of sparks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though dry enough to burn with the flame. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, perhaps the heat of its blaze had dried it and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be well to have another try.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Holding the bit of charred cotton under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartz, I struck the stone with the knife and the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment gave vent to an involuntary shout of triumph.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cotton was glowing like a live coal, and by blow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon it and placing some shreds of palm leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it, I soon had a blaze going.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was a contingency that did not interest me at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and I was fully satisfied at having discovered how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to produce fire by flint and steel.

The next instant some one leaped upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I was seized and bound, and although I struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically, I was utterly helpless in the grip of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">assailant.

But the next moment the question was</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. Holding the blazing firebrand for a torch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the king began searching the pockets of my clothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chuckling to himself, he drew out the cartridges and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my note book, tossed the burning stick into the fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a derisive laugh rushed off with his fellows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving me helpless and raging at my loss.

He had repeatedly seen me reach into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket for the book; he must have been keen enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to notice that I took something from my pocket when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused the explosions, and he had reasoned that by</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessing himself of my magic-making device, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could perform the same miracles himself.

No doubt, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, as soon as he had impressed his subjects with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own power, he would have me done away with, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the thought of how he might do it, rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">my death, that troubled me. Suddenly, my disquieting</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts were interrupted by the muffled roar of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion from the direction of the main cavern.

The more I thought of it the more determined I</seg><seg type="columnLine">became to find out what lay beyond the river, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of bridging it occurred to me. It may sound like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very simple matter to speak of building a bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a narrow river, where plenty of large trees are</seg><seg type="columnLine">available. And under ordinary circumstances it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have been a difficult feat. But if you consider that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my only serviceable tool was a much worn machete,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the savages had never learned to cut down</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, had never seen or heard of a bridge, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with unreasoning, superstitious dread of cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the river, the difficulties before me may be some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what appreciated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Weeks elapsed before the crude bridge was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. I was forced to make numerous stone axes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplement my machete, to teach the savages how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell trees, how to use rollers and levers, and in fact in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struct them in the simplest and most elementary prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciples of mechanics, before any real work was at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted. I soon found it easier to burn down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees than to cut them, and after incalculable labor I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rewarded with several long, strong, tree trunks</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for use on the river bank at the narrowest por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the stream. The next question was to place the</seg><seg type="columnLine">logs across from shore to shore. To solve this problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost me many hours of anxious thought and an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense amount of labor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'At last we erected a pair of 'shears' of strong logs</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound together with vines, which were raised above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the logs at the very brink of the river. A crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheave, made by slinging a roller of wood in two loops</seg><seg type="columnLine">of liana rope, served as a pulley, and by passing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stout liana over this, and by the gigantic ape-like men</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauling on it, one end of the largest log was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised high in air. The rope was then made fast, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd of willing and powerful blacks lifted and pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the butt end forward, and at last the log stood almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect. So delighted were the savages when they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">this seemingly impossible feat accomplished, that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost ruined everything by releasing their holds on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lines in order to dance and shout with triumph.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I managed to save the day by getting a quick turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">around one of the shear-legs in the nick of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'When the hilarious monkey-men were once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">under control, I directed them to lift the butt-end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suspended log and push it forward until at last it</seg><seg type="columnLine">etood erect with one end resting on the nearest bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other towering twenty feet or more above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shears. Stout stakes were then driven into the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the log to prevent its slipping back; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed loosely to these so it could not kick up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">while my subjects looked on in wonder, I cut the rope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a tremendous crash it fell, with its top resting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the further bank of the river. The delight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages at sight of the log bridge was wonderful. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled and shouted, pranced and leaped about, rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the grass and roared with glee. Then, like a crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">of school children on a holiday, they raced across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge which, to their feet, formed a safe and easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadway. Never in the history of their race had any</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of the tribe crossed the river, and now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream was spanned, they frolicked on the farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore, entirely forgetting their former superstitious</seg><seg type="columnLine">fears of the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'The monkey-men might be perfectly satisfied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single round log for a bridge, but it was far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfactory for my purpose, although I managed, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable difficulty to crawl across. I forced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages to abandon their merrymaking and place a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond log along side the first. By nightfall, a good sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantial bridge had been completed and the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the valley was opened to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'On the following day I crossed with Mumba, sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral of the monkey-men trailing behind, and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my explorations. This side of the valley was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">richer in natural resources than the other, for its wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, fruits and vegetables had never been touched by</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Deer, tapir, peccaries and other creatures were</seg><seg type="columnLine">abundant; curassows and pheasants abounded, and sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral times I saw the royal purple Wauponas, at sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which Mumba and his fellows always prostrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves. It was such a pleasant, interesting district</seg><seg type="columnLine">that 1 did not feel greatly depressed even when I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was no chance of ascending the cliffs. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was while I was examining the rocky walls, search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for a possible slope up which I might climb, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I made a very interesting discovery. I had come upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new rock, almost as clear as glass, which I felt sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">would lend itself to making very superior stone imple-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, and I was gathering up a number of the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces, when I noticed a bit of stone of a semi-trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent green color. It was so much like a bit of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken bottle that at first I mistook it for a fragment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glass and my heart gave an extra beat at thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some white man had visited the valley before me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as I picked the fragment up and examined it, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that it was a natural formation, a splinter</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a regular crystal. Then suddenly it dawned upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. It was an emerald, a bit of gem worth several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred dollars in the markets of the world, but to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prisoner in the valley of the monkey-men, worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than the flakes of common quartz. I laughed de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">risively as I thought of it, and was on the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurling the precious bit of green against the cliff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when common sense returned to me. Suppose I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape from the valley? For, despite the apparent hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness of my plight, I had not given up hope. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did get away, the emerald would go far towards mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my way easier; it might even stand between me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and starvation, for until I could reach civilization and</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw upon my resources, I would be penniless, ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely destitute. But throughout the land, even in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most remote villages, the green gem would be negoti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. Thus thinking, I pocketed the emerald, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">renewed interest began searching for more. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well rewarded. Among the debris, crystals and por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of crystals were everywhere, and rapidly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratched and dug among the fallen rock and gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green mineral, while Mumba, seeing what I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">after, fell to and secured twice as many as I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. But the supply was limited. The emeralds had</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously been brought down by a landslide from</seg><seg type="columnLine">some pocket or vein far up on the precipice, and long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly I gazed up, trying to locate the spot and won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering what incalculable fortunes might still lie in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliffside. Even the gems I had were enough to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE KING OF THE MONKEY MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">247</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me in comfort for a long time--provided I ever es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caped, and I found no little pleasure and amusement in</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculating on how I would spend my fortune, if ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did reach civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'For several days thereafter I roamed the valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping against hope to discover some exit I had over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked before. Each day, too, the river fell and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">current decreased, and I noticed that the stream no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer filled its tunnel through the cliff at the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the valley. Above the water there now showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opening several feet in height and fifty feet or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more in width, and k was this aperture which finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave me the idea that seemed the only possible solu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to my dilemma. Would it not be feasible to es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape through this tunnel? To be sure, such a venture</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be perilous in the extreme. I would be entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unknown Stygian passage, which might very well</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove a trap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'For all I knew the tunnel might narrow or de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease in height so as to be filled with the racing</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. At one or a hundred spots jagged rocks might</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar the way. Somewhere within the cliff there might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be falls or rapids, or even if none of these menaces ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isted within the rocky wall, the stream might dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a precipice or flow in terrific rapids where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged on the farther side. And I had no means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing how long the tunnel might be. The river</seg><seg type="columnLine">might flow under ground for miles, or again the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage might be less than fifty feet in length. All of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this I pondered upon and I knew that to go blindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it would be worse than suicidal. But gradually, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave thought to the idea and it grew in my mind, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to formulate plans to learn something definite re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding the tunnel and the stream before thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously of attempting to escape by river.' It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very simple matter, once it came to my mind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without delay I set about putting it into practice. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">this end in view, I constructed a miniature raft, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">attaching a long coil of vine rope to this, I allowed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to float into the tunnel. Rapidly the line paid out as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raft vanished within the aperture in the rock un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til nearly two hundred feet had slipped smoothly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without jerk or interruption through my fingers. Evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently there were no rapids, falls nor reefs for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance within the passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'But I wanted also to be sure if the space between</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and roof remained constant, and whether or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel widened or grew more narrow. I soon hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a plan for determining these points. Cutting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of stocks, I fastened them upright, like masts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my little raft and cut them at varying lengths, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">longest nearly five feet in length, the shortest barely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot in length. Then, across the affair, I lightly bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender sticks of varying lengths and again allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my test raft to float into the passage, knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I drew it out again the condition of the sticks</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a fairly accurate record of the conditions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passage. And to my delight, when the raft was</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrawn, I found only one of the upright sticks</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken, and that the longest, while not one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizontal sticks was injured or missing. Assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the cavern roof was at least four feet above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water for fully two hundred feet from the entrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that it was nowhere less than ten feet in width,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I decided to make a personal inspection of the place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To do this would necessitate building a raft large</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to float me, and several days were consumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this work and in gathering a tremendous amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lianas for rope, for I intended to penetrate far</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the two hundred foot limit on my explorations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'Fortunately there were plenty of the light balsa or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trumpet-trees in the valley, and building a raft was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">comparatively easy feat. But to the monkey-men it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">savored of magic and witchcraft. And when they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crude affair bobbing on the water, and saw their</seg><seg type="columnLine">king step aboard and drift down stream, they became</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely terrified and beat their breasts and wailed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently thinking their white monarch was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave them forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'It was with great difficulty that I reassured them,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and, running the raft ashore, disembarked. But it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still more difficult to force them to permit me to board</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the raft once more, and I knew that I would have my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands more than full if I attempted to enter the tun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nel. In that case, they would assuredly feel I was de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">serting them, and despite my impatience, I knew that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I would have to postpone my investigations until they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">became accoustomed to seeing me navigate the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hence, for the next day or two, I made daily trips</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down stream upon my raft, each day approaching</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nearer and nearer my goal, and as the novelty wore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">off and the savages learned by experience that I al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ways came ashore again, they began to look upon my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inexplicable occupation as a regular thing and quite to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be expected. But try as I might, I could not induce</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one of them--not even Mumba himself, to set foot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aboard the raft. It was on one of these short voyages</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I made another discovery which, had I been other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than a virtual prisoner, would have filled me or any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other man with excitement and delight. The raft had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grounded upon a sand bar, and in order to get it free,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I was forced to move several good sized cobbles. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing this I caught an unmistakable yellow gleam</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the fine black sand in the recess left by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. Forgetting everything, forgetting my state, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings, even plans for my escape, I dropped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my knees and dug feverishly with fast beating heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the gravel. The next moment, with almost bated</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, I was gloating over an immense gold nugget,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighing fully ten pounds. Rapidly, with machete and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, I dug away the sand, stopping every few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments to secure a rough yellow nodule, until my first</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement was exhausted and common sense returned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat back and roared with delirious laughter. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still a prisoner of the monkey-men's valley and all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold in the world was of no slightest value to me until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could be sure of escaping. But, like the emeralds, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, if I ever left the place, would be riches, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined that before I made any attempt to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, I would lay in a good supply of the precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'It was two days after this strike that I decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attempt my long deferred exploration of the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terranean stream. It was with the utmost difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I made the monkey-men understand what I wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to do. In fact, Mumba, who by constant associa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with me could grasp my meaning more quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the others, and who, by the way, was far more</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent than his fellows, was the only one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">really understood my desires. I had not over much</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence in him, and yet, in a way, my life depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his and his companions' carrying out my orders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I quite fully appreciated the fact that I was taking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous risk, but my mind was made up. I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate the tunnel to the limit of my vine ropes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless forced to give up before then, and I hoped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that distance to be able to see the further outlet to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. I had already prepared torches of resinous gum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and equipped with several of these, I moored the raft</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the tunnel entrance and repeated my instruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to Mumba for the last time. A strong line had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been made fast to the raft and to a stout stake driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the earth, and fully five hundred feet of this lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiled neatly on the bank. In addition, I had pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided a light line to be used as a signal cord, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">great danger lay in the possibility that the primitive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">248</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ape-like beings might confuse my signals or become</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic-stricken and desert me, once I had vanished in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel. However, I consoled myself with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that if worst came to worst, I could probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">haul myself back to daylight, for the river's current</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now very slight. By words and gestures and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a demonstration, I impressed my signals upon Mumba.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One pull at the light line and heavy line was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">held fast; two pulls and more was to be let out, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">three pullr meant to haul in. A bit fearful of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">might lay before me, I lit my torch, stepped upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raft, pushed it from shore, and ordered Mumba to pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the line. The next instant, I floated in inky dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, illuminated only by the ruddy glow from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch. Steadily I drifted on, holding my torch aloft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving it about, and peering into the shadows. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found nothing that would impede my progress. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">current remained constant, the roof and walls varied</seg><seg type="columnLine">little in height or width, there were no jutting rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">or reefs, and the tunnel was nearly as straight as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been drilled by man. At last I reached the lim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">its of my ropes, and still no glimmer of light ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The passage might continue so for miles for all I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew; yet the fact that it was navigable for such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable distance gave me much encouragement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finding nothing to discover, I jerked three times on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signal line, and presently felt myself being hauled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back whence I had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'I have never seen more curious expressions on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces of any human beings than those of the monkey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, when I reappeared. They showed fear, awe, won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and sadness combined, and all these gave way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumphant, hilarious shouts when they realized that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not vanished forever. It really affected me deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see how much my subjects thought of me, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced a pang of regret and felt something of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoundrel at the idea of deserting them. However, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was now firmly made up. I would steal down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place before dawn, and taking my life in my hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would attempt the passage of the tunnel as soon as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could complete necessary preparations. With the find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the emeralds and the gold, and the thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of civilization and its comforts which would follow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer imprisonment in the valley became intolerable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Better death in the subterranean stream than life in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley among the ape-like people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'But my preparations could not be made in a day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the first place, I decided that a raft would not serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">my purpose. It was a cumbersome thing, ill adapted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to running possible rapids, too heavy for one man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle in swift water or to dislodge from a reef or</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar, and, if I succeeded in passing through the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain in safety, its progress would be very slow upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">any stream I might descend. To build a boat would, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, be far too great an undertaking to consider,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even a dugout would be beyond me and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey-men laborers. But to construct a woodskin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as I had often used and had frequently helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">make in the forests of Guiana and Brazil, would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither impossible nor very difficult. The main trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be to find a tree with bark that could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripped from the trunk in one large cylindrical piece.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'But fortune favored me. Trees very similar to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple-heart grew here and there in the red-leaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest, and a test proved that their bark was perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">adapted to my requirements. Work was at once begun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in due time I had a large tree felled, and by dint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of painstaking work and with the aid of my priceless</seg><seg type="columnLine">machete, I managed to wedge off a splendid section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tough thick bark. The rest was comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple. Spreaders of hard wood were easily cut and</seg><seg type="columnLine">having nicked and bent the ends of the bark together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and having secured them in place with strips of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rattan-like vine, the spreaders were forced between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gunwales and my canoe was complete. Many a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">two Indians and myself had constructed such a wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin in a few hours, but here in the valley many days</seg><seg type="columnLine">of laborious work had been required. The canoe, how,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, was a complete success. It floated buoyantly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water, was steady and easily handled, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey-men regarded it as another miracle. By now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, they had become so accustomed to miracles</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they gave them little heed; in fact, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this time so occupied with their own affairs, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was often difficult for me to induce them to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me. I had taught them many arts and crafts, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had become most enthusiastic and interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their new accomplishments. I had shown them how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin and weave, for these purposes using the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark of the "Seda Virgin" or lace-bark tree which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soft, tough and strong as silk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'They had already used the material for the bits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scanty loin-cloths they wore, but they had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that it could be twisted or spun into thread</seg><seg type="columnLine">and woven into coarse cloth or made into hammocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The monkey-men took to the latter as ducks take to</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and everywhere the comfortable swinging beds</seg><seg type="columnLine">had supplanted the piles of dried palm leaves in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages' apartments. Fish hooks of bone and fishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of bark, had also been introduced and were in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant use, and I had taught the people to till the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raise vegetables instead of grubbing for them here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there. I had even succeeded in twisting or spin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning the wild cotton and weaving it by hand and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent many hours trying to devise and construct some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of loom; this, however, I found beyond me. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">far greater success in making baskets, and once the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey-men had learned the principle, they became</seg><seg type="columnLine">adept basket makers. Pottery had followed the baskets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every member of the tribe was well supplied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthenware dishes, basket and high finished and well</seg><seg type="columnLine">made stone tools, implements and weapons. Indeed, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically all savage arts and industries, the monkey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were now fully the equals of the ordinary prim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itive Indians of the country and were rapidly develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a culture of their own, for all I had to do was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">start them on anything and they progressed rapidly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolving and introducing many ideas and innovations</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " 'I have told all this as if it required little time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I confess that time passed far more rapidly than I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought possible. I was really surprised, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted over my time strings, on the day my canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was completed, to discover that I had been with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey-men for more than a year and that the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainy season was rapidly approaching. If I was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape by way of the river I must act promptly, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause with the first heavy rains, the tunnel would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">impassable for months. Fortunately I had few prepar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ations to make. Ever since I had decided to attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passage, I had been gathering a supply of provisions</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shape of dried meat, tubers, roots and vegetables,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I now had enough to last me several weeks. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammock, a bundle of dry sticks and leaves, my flint</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tinder, my machete, my bow and arrows and sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral torches, completed my equipment. I was ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out at a moment's notice, but I was determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure more gold from my rich placer for, I reasoned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I did reach civilization, it would be most welcome;</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I failed, I would be no worse off with the gold than</seg><seg type="columnLine">without it. And it was this determination that very</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly cost me my life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'When it actually came to the point of leaving, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt not a little sad and depressed, for though I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have believed it possible, I had become attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the monkey-men and felt as if they were old friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE KING OF THE MONKEY MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">249</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and my own people.

But I realized that even if I could persuade</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to embark in my canoe and attempt the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage--which I very much doubted--he would prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably pine away and die of loneliness and homesickness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from his people and among strangers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'And I found myself strangely excited and nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the hour for my secret departure approached. I slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">little the night before and was up before dawn; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before the sun rose I had my belongings stowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my woodskin or bark canoe and was drifting down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river towards the bar where I had discovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'By the time I reached the spot, it was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and drawing the bow of my craft on the bar, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">set to work with my machete and a wooden hoe I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. The place was far richer than I had imagined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in nearly every handful of gravel and sand, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I washed and sifted in a basketwork tray and "panned"</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in an earthenware basin, I found nuggets. .No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt the finer flakes and dust were even more abund-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant, but I could not spare the time to secure these, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">contented myself with the larger lumps and nuggets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal. So interested did I become in my labors that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not realize how time was passing, until my at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention was attracted by the loud rumbling of distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder. I was rather startled, for according to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations, the first heavy rains were not due for sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral days and thunder was most unusual except as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompaniment to these first torrential downpours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dawn, I noticed, was rapidly approaching; the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky was already light, and I saw that the sky was</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcast and that a bank of heavy black clouds hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">low over the summit of the cliff at the opposite end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley. All this I noticed, and stopped to gather a</seg><seg type="columnLine">last basketful of gravel, thinking to myself that with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few more nuggets I would be satisfied, for civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's greed at sight of gold is irresistible. Then an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other terrific crash of thunder echoed over the valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverberating from cliff to cliff. Startled, realizing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must hurry if I was to get away before the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke, I shoved my canoe free from the bar, grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">my paddle, and headed down stream. It was fully two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles by the river from the bar to the tunnel, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore I had covered half the distance it was broad day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. I noticed, too, that I seemed to be moving very</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, while the clouds had now spread until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered half the sky, and peals of thunder and vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashes of lightning were frequent. Still I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize my peril, did not dream that the cloud-burst-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">deluge would break for many hours, perhaps for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Not until I was close to the yawning black hole was</seg><seg type="columnLine">I aware that the rains must be falling with tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence in my rear, that on the highlands beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls of the valley the storm was raging, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake which fed the river had been flooded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pouring its surplus water into the valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'But as I saw the entrance to the tunnel before me</seg><seg type="columnLine">I realized this and was panic stricken.

The river</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rushing me forward, straight for the hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff, and its current held my frail canoe in the centre</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the channel despite my utmost endeavors to swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it aside. My heart seemed to stand still; I felt sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and faint with terror as I saw that already the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the tunnel to within a yard of the arched roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Certain death faced me, I felt sure.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next instant the black arch was above the dancing bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my canoe. Scarcely aware of my action, I threw my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self flat in the bottom of the woodskin, shot into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel, and was enveloped in absolute darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> £rp REMBLING, shaking, expecting at any mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to feel the water pouring over the gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wales of my canoe, to hear its sides grinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the rock roof as the water rose, I lay there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ages seemed to pass. There was not a glimmer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light; only the roar of rushing water filling the awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground tunnel. Gradually, as the minutes passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the canoe still dashed onward unharmed, I grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmer. Perhaps the passage was higher inside than</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the entrance. There was a chance that I might yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">win through, borne on the first crest of the flood, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously, I raised my paddle, expecting to feel it</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike the roof above. But it met with no resistance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and encouraged, with new hope, I managed to light a</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch and held it aloft. Barely discernible in the glow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see the walls of the tunnel, sparkling and glint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as the light was reflected from the crystalline rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fully ten feet above my head I saw the water-worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof with its pendant stalactites. I breathed more</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. For the present I was in no real danger, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed to me that the current was not as swift now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'But my canoe was gyrating wildly, swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and in imminent peril of capsizing or dashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a wall or some submerged rock. Fixing my</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch in the bow, I grasped my paddle and guided the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe along the centre of the stream. Onward, ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">onward I went. Often the river swept around sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">bends, and had the craft been left to itself, it most</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly would have been wrecked. Often, too, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel became very narrow, but always there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample space between my head and the roof, and grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually full confidence returned to me. Then, suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging around a sharp curve, my greatest dread was</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized. The roof lowered abruptly, and before me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foaming torrent seemed to completely fill the channel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before I could cry out, the flaring torch struck the low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung rock and was knocked overboard, and barely in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I ducked and threw myself prone in my canoe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, I knew was the end. I would be drowned like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rat in a trap, and deeply, bitterly I regretted ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">having left the valley of the monkey-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Again and again I felt the gunwales of my canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">bump against the roof above. Each time, as it grated</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the rock and momentarily hesitated in its on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward rush, my heart seemed to stop beating and I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all was over. Often, too, as the craft grated</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly along, water slopped over the sides and I lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, sick, terrified, half-submerged in icy water, help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, unable to rise, awaiting death. It was torture in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">describable, agony beyond words, and then, just as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the canoe stopping, as the friction against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof was too great for the current to overcome, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness suddenly vanished and the tunnel was filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with light. The next instant the canoe shot forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with dazed eyes I gazed up at a vast stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear blue sky. I was saved; saved by the narrowest</seg><seg type="columnLine">margin, for as I sat up, blinking and shaking, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced back, I saw the last few inches of the tunnel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth vanish in a mass of bubbling seething water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'With a mighty sigh of thankfulness and relief I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about. I was floating on the surface of a broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream into which the river from the valley emptied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On every side stretched the dark, dim aisles of heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">250</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forests, rich, green and cool, and I shouted aloud and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried at the welcome sight of so much greenery, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vine-draped trees with never a red leaf visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'For hours I paddled and drifted down the stream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed I knew not where, but content to know that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had escaped; that somewhere ahead lay the coast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization, and that before me--with good fortune</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reasonable care--lay life and freedom among my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow men. So anxious was I to put all possible dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance between me and the valley I had left, that I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even stop to eat ashore, but munched dried meat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fruit until well into the afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Then, overcome with weariness from my exertions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my excitement, I ran the woodskin ashore in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little cove sheltered by vines and brush, and making it</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, stepped into the forest. Within a dozen yards of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore I routed a small herd of peccaries, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky shot, brought down one of the beasts with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow. Soon a fire was blazing and I dined well on</seg><seg type="columnLine">broiled pork and roast yams. Then, refreshed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepy, I threw myself in my hammock and instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'It was dark when I again awoke, and feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirsty, I stepped towards the river to secure a drink.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I reached the bank and stooped to secure a cala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bash from my canoe, my eyes caught sight of a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow far down the stream. For a brief moment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at it, puzzled. Then my somewhat sleep-be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuddled mind cleared and I realized that it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light from a fire. Some one was near, some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings were camped within a mile of where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. Were they friends or foes, Indians or white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men? I had no idea where I was, how far from civ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilization, whether in an Indian country or in a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trict frequented by rubber gatherers or other natives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those whose camp fire cast a ruddy glare upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river might be white, black or red, and if the latter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might be either friendly or hostile. Anxious as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was to meet a fellow human being, I knew I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cautious. I must not run blindly into a camp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages, who would kill me out of hand and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">feast on my body afterwards. But I was a skilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman; I felt confident that I could approach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">;-re unseen and unheard, and if the campers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized or semi-civilized, I would land; if they ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be hostile Indians, I could drift on down</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, out of their way. Accordingly I silently un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened my canoe, as silently stepped into it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the paddle, and as noiselessly as one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows along shore, I floated down towards the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Keeping close to the opposite shore and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy shadows of the jungle, I rapidly approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light, until I dared go no further. Then, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">my canoe close under the bank, I stepped ashore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taking advantage of every tree trunk and clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bamboos, I picked my way along until I was opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire. As I came within sight of it, I gasped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped in my tracks, almost unable to believe my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. In a small opening in the forest blazed a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire and gathered about it were four, naked, painted'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians armed with powerful bows and long arrows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was not these savages who had rivetted my at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention, but a fifth figure. Bound to a small tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the fire was a woman, a girl whose scantily-clad</seg><seg type="columnLine">body and face, clearly visible by the fire light, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmistakably white!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Who was she? What was she doing here, a captive</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those fierce-visaged Indians? Even from the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance I could see that she was very beautiful and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face showed no signs of fear, nothing but a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed, hopeless expression, as she watched the Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the fire. That they were hostiles was obvious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was probable that they were also cannibals. My</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heart sickened as I realized that their lovely captive</seg><seg type="columnLine">might soon furnish food to form a cannibal feast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My blood boiled while I gazed helplessly at the bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">white girl and her painted captors. But what could I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do to aid her? I was powerless against four armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages. With a gun, even with a revolver, I might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolhardy enough to attack them, counting on the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise and the terror of firearms to win the day. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">unarmed, except for an inferior bow and arrows, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance had I? And then, suddenly, as I thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire-arms, I had an inspiration. Back to my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed the memory of the consternation caused by my</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploding cartridges among the monkey-men. I still</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the one cartridge the king had overlooked when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had robbed me. If I could only approach closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to the fire to throw the shell into the flames, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might frighten the Indians into flight, and in the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion, rescue the girl. Of course, it was a wild, hair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brained scheme with every chance against its success.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even if by craft and good luck I managed to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">within reach of the fire, the odds were all against me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might fail to throw the cartridge into the flames;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might not explode; the Indians might not be ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rified, or they might recover from their fright before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could release the captive, or, even if they ran and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured the girl, they might, and probably would, pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sue us in canoes. But had they canoes? I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed any, and I peered into every shadow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched every hiding place along the shore without</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing a craft of any kind. No, I was convinced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had nothing to fear on that score, and great as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">risks were, I determined to take them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Better far to lose my life in an effort to save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl than to leave her in her sad plight and be haunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rest of my life with msmory of her there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly my plans were formed. Retracing my steps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shoved my canoe from shore, paddled it silently up</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream beyond range of the fire light, crossed quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the opposite shore, and allowed the woodskin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">float down stream. Just above the fire, a small point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">land jutted into the water, and here I moored my</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft, fastening it to a paddle thrust into the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud, which could be withdrawn instantly. I was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">so close that I could hear the voices of the Indians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and though they spoke in such low gutteral tones that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not understand them, I recognized their speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a dialect of the Myankos--the fiercest, most implac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able cannibals of the South American jungles. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discovery, although it confirmed my fears for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's fate, encouraged me. The Myankos were prim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itive, aloof, hostile, and were never in touch with</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized man. Hence the chances that the exploding</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridge would terrify them were greater. But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to use the shell, I must reach the fire, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed an impossible feat to do this, unseen and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard. From across the river, however, I had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">note of every detail of the vicinity, and my long bush</seg><seg type="columnLine">training served me well. At one side of the fire, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its limbs extending almost over it, was a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">mora tree, its squat trunk, wide spreading roots and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled vines affording an easy means of ascent. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could gain the shelter of the branches and worm my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way out on a limb, I could almost drop the cartridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the flames below. But to climb that tree without</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise and without attracting the attention of the In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dians, was, I knew, impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'But I had a scheme, which I prayed and hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">might serve me. Grasping two of my yams I crept into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelter of the mora tree, and with a long breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with all my strength, I hurled one of the yams into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black shadows of the jungle beyond the fire. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly, as the tuber crashed into the brush, the savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to their feet, listened a moment, and then, grasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE KING OF THE MONKEY MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">251</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their ready weapons, three of them dashed towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound. Even the girl turned and stared towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot, while the fourth savage remained tense and</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectant near the fire. The next instant the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">yam crashed through the foliage and dropped with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">splash into the water down stream. With a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry, the fourth Indian rushed away, while the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">three shouted and hurried in the same direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scarcely had the second yam left my hand when I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathlessly scrambling up the tree trunk. Quickly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained the lowest branches, and heedless of bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling bark and the rustle of twigs and leaves, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wormed myself along the limb until I lay hidden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting within ten feet of the fire. I had no time to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spare.

As we slipped down the river that day, Merima</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me much about her tribe, her life, and the habits</seg><seg type="columnLine">and customs of the Petoradis. The more she told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more I marveled that I had never before heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tribe. But, after all, it was not so very surprising,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for while I was familiar with much of the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">and many of its Indian denizens, still I knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were countless tribes dwelling in the remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastnesses of the unexplored jungles, whose existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unknown even to other aborigines. And I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had been and still was in a very remote portion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the land. The village of the Metakis, where I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first run across the Waupona, was far from the coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and settlements; from there I had travelled countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles further into the interior to the valley of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey-men, and for all I knew I was now farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">inland than when I was in the valley. I tried to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Merima where the Patoradis dwelt, but her</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge was very vague and she had not the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of the direction in which she had been carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">by her savage captors. All she knew was that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">home had been within sight of large snow-capped</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains and beside a river, but from what she told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me of the people and their habits and food I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they must have dwelt at a comparatively high al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude on one of the great inland plateaus. She was, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, very curious about me and my people, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite unable to grasp the idea of any race of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">other than Indians or of any land other than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which she was accustomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'When we stopped at noonday for lunch, I suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in killing a curassow or wild turkey, and while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merima was preparing this, I searched about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon found a good sized Seda Virgin tree. From this</seg><seg type="columnLine">I obtained a large sheet of the cloth-like inner bark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by roping the ends of this by means of strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord made of twisted strips of the same bark, I fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned a rough and ready, but quite serviceable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable hammock, for I had no intention of letting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl sleep in the canoe or on the ground exposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the attacks of ants and other insect pests, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had positively refused to let me give up my ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mock for her.

Throughout the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon she worked diligently, shredding the grass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting the fibre into cord, and by night she had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of balls of strong, soft twine with which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed me she planned to weave a real hammock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But a good hammock cannot be made in a day, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than a week later that she at last swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">her new hammock between the trees. She was a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-reliant creature and had a far greater knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bush resources and native handicraft than I pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed, and I often wondered how any white girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have fared if left to her own devices in a jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Merima could have lived quite comfortably if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had found herself alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Constantly, too, as we drifted along from dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">until dark, I was planning for her future.

I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that there might be obstacles to this if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarthy officials saw her and cast covetous eyes upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, for after all she was an Indian, and, in the minds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the natives, Indians are all fair prey. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances were that the first place we reached would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be some tiny village with a ragged, barefooted "cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regidor" or "alcalde" who would be quite willing to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything within or without the law in return for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my nuggets or a small emerald. Even if we came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large town and I had difficulties with the legal mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters I had enough wealth to buy any Latin American</seg><seg type="columnLine">official who ever lived. Moreover, where there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlement there also would be a church and a padre,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my first step would be to have Merima baptized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have a priest act as her godfather, after which</seg><seg type="columnLine">her status in the community would be entirely altered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merima, however, was of course an utter pagan, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to carry out my plans she would have to pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sees some knowledge of the Christian religion and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to join the Church. With this in mind I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to devote my time to instructing her.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see she regarded my words as some sort of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairy tale or legend. I tried my hardest to explain my</seg><seg type="columnLine">beliefs and to impress her. She was a very intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">young woman and quick to guess at my meaning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to supply words where I failed, and she soon began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand and to take a real interest and to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions. I must confess that many of her queries</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have baffled a far more advanced theologian than</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, and many of her interrogations set me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking along lines which had never before occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. Why, she asked, was the Christian God superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the gods of the Patoradis? All her life she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given health, food, shelter, friends and everything she</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired. Could my God give her anything more? But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I pointed out, the Indians' gods had failed them when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Myankos attacked them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " ' "And does the Bearded One's God never fail His</seg><seg type="columnLine">people?" she demanded. "Do the people of my Bearded</seg><seg type="columnLine">One never have wars, and are they never killed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'I flushed and hesitated, but I was forced to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fess that the Christian God apparently allowed His</seg><seg type="columnLine">worshippers to meet with disaster as frequently as</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the gods of the Indians. Merima, nevertheless, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite willing to embrace Christianity, not because she</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed in it or had been converted by my words, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">because she felt that it was my wish and since it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">my religion she should make it hers. However, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a convert might not be all that a strict church-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man might desire, my purpose would be served. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, I knew, understand any ordinary questions that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be asked her by a priest, and she had a fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">good idea of the underlying basis of Christianity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later on she could be properly instructed. From all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this it might be assumed that I am a deeply religious</seg><seg type="columnLine">man; but I am not. I do not belong to any particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect or church, and I firmly believe that every man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman has a right to worship any deity or deities he</seg><seg type="columnLine">or she prefers. I have dwelt among many races with</seg><seg type="columnLine">many beliefs, and it seems to me one religion is as</seg><seg type="columnLine">good as another, provided a person has true faith and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives up to the teachings of that religion. In fact I</seg><seg type="columnLine">254</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have never had any patience whatever with those mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guided individuals or sects who are forever striving</seg><seg type="columnLine">to force their own personal beliefs and religions down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throats of others who do not agree with them.

But I knew in a Catholic country where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Church possesses vast power and influence, it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">both to her advantage and my own to have her a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christian--outwardly at least.

But her tongue, lips and vocal cords, accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to producing the gutteral, peculiar sounds of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">native dialect, were ill adapted for pronouncing English</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. Often her attempts to repeat a word after me</seg><seg type="columnLine">were highly amusing, and we both laughed heartily</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she pursed her lips, screwed up her face and slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and painstakingly tried to pronounce some word, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fail utterly. But she was a persevering little thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enthusiastically desirous of succeeding, and grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually, as the days passed, she learned to utter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. And to my amazement, when she did master</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sounds, she spoke the words without the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">accent. She was most particular in this respect, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not speak a word which she could not pronounce</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly. This made her progress rather slow and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">foresaw that it would be a long time before she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">express herself readily or even thoroughly understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">English, for so highly developed was her sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound--the slightest varying shade of accent or pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nunciation of an Indian word changes its meaning--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a word carelessly spoken or mispronounced was</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely unintelligible to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'But if my attempts to instruct Merima accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished little in some ways, yet they served to pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, and the days sped swiftly.

Hence</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew it was on the eighteenth day after emerging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tunnel that we struck the first rapids. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure, we had several times passed through swift,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken water, but nothing that was dangerous or diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult, and the canoe had behaved wonderfully. But now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, stretched a long series of foaming, rock-filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapids stretched ahead. Alone, I should not have hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated to have run boldly through them, but with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">added weight and the responsibility of Merima I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather fearful of attempting it in my frail craft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mooring the woodskin at the head of the rapids, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped ashore, and with Merima by my side, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked down stream examining the rushing water, lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating the rocks and speculating on my chances of</seg><seg type="columnLine">running the gauntlet safely. They were not bad as</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapids go in the bush, and luckily there were no true</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls or cataracts. Had the stretch of broken water</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shorter, however, I would have laboriously por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taged the canoe around rather than take the risk. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was an impossible task to portage the craft for</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a mile through the forest, and Merima laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my hesitation, declaring that there was no danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that many a time she had run far worse rapids</seg><seg type="columnLine">by herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Moreover, she could, I knew, swim like an otter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for she regularly took her morning dip and appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much at home |n water as on land.

This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouraging, but I was aware that many miles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many days of travel might still lie before us. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be even worse rapids and falls ahead; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">each hour that we sped on we drew nearer and nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the haunts of civilized men. Also, there might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlements or even good-sized towns far up this river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Often, too, we had passed the mouths of other streams;</seg><seg type="columnLine">some mere creeks, other good-sized rivers, which made</seg><seg type="columnLine">me feel sure that the stream we were following was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a main river or the tributary of some great river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So far, too, we had met no Indians, and this also con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced me that we were on a major stream, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians seldom dwell upon such large rivers; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">prefer the smaller streams and creeks. Still we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained a sharp lookout for chance canoes drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the banks or for signs of savages, for we never</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, but that, when rounding some bend or turn, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might suddenly find ourselves face to face with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat load of hostiles or a village of enemy Indians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More than once we had found unmistakable proofs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of savages in the neighborhood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Once we had found a dead deer floating in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">backwater and with the broken shaft of an arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">protruding from his neck.

I was absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless, powerless even to warn my companion of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching doom. The flicker of an eyelid might</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring the deadly missile from the blowgun, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">marveled that my fast throbbing heart and fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken limbs had not already warned the savage that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was awake. Nearer and nearer to the hammocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept the other two Indians.

Frantically but</seg><seg type="columnLine">vainly the Indians were struggling against the hordes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of biting, ravenous, hunger-mad ants which on every</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, surrounded and overwhelmed them, covering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground with a living, undulating carpet that pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily onward like a living torrent, and relentlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">devouring every living thing in its path. Over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking Indians the creatures swarmed, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">under our hammocks, from all about, from the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">near, came the sound of their moving bodies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry jaws, like the rustle of a wind among dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves. I shuddered and I saw Merima's eyes widen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her face blanch, as glancing about, we saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black millions covering the earth, swarming up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, covering everything except our hammocks within</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we were safe from attack, for the army-ants will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not cross a rough rope.

The third, the last to take alarm, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been silenced; he had been overwhelmed and was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden under the swarming ants.

And as I related my tale, or as much of it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to do with Merima, and explained my plans and</seg><seg type="columnLine">desires, he listened attentively, nodding now and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and uttering half-suppressed exclamations of amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at times, until I had ended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'"It is a strange, a most marvelous tale, my son,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he exclaimed. "You have seen things which have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted no other man, and through all you have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">led and guarded by our Heavenly Father. In my</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth, I, too, was filled with the spirit of adventure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wandered far and among strange peoples, striving</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever to spread the true Faith. Many Indian tribes did</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know--and, Alas!

And he is a good friend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine. I misdoubt if he knows the law or if he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">the papers necessary to be signed, but in such mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters I can act for the State as well as the Church,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all Don Ramon need do is to sign his name and</seg><seg type="columnLine">affix his seal. But as you thought, my son, first must</seg><seg type="columnLine">the maiden be baptized and registered as a Christian</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a communicant of my church, for under the law,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pagan, the Indians are wards of the government</seg><seg type="columnLine">and may not be treated like other citizens. And a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most worthy deed have you done in teaching the child</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truths of Christianity and in converting her to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief in our true God. Now, my son, will I summon</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Marta and give the maiden into her care to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly clad.

Many times I had listened to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">effusions about a thousand apparently unrelated sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects, only to hear him suddenly dart out a crisp</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentence which showed that he had been unraveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mystery all the time. I had often marveled at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of abstraction, this ability to speak eloquently</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his mind was relentlessly sifting out the essential</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the non-essential and arranging the selected de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails in such logical order, that I wondered why I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might not have deduced the simple solution of an ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently hopeless tangle of complications. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that back in his head he carried a picture of Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">baule, with her slim throat and large eyes, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would waste no time in solving a case which sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded her with such personal danger. I dozed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termittently, and as I looked up from time to time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Elon examining a pamphlet under his lens or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the written warning to Denbaule, and twice I was awak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened by the rustling of a huge map. Once I mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered a profane reproach as he pulled me down flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the seat; but in a second I understood his action,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a heavy missile crashed through the window.

Elon</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduced him as Valonne, head of the local branch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the service. As we stood just outside the railings</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the underground train-shed a huge, rubber-tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck, piled high with trunks, came bearing noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly upon us.

I read the note again, testing whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">our usual code for ephemeral notes would shed light</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the mystery, but reversing the words by threes</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no sense.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy was operating a small hand-press and a bent old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man wearing a green eye-shade leaned over the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">type-case in the room. He listened attentively while</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 explained my wishes, and promised to have the job</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready at ten the next morning, although he stipulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bonus for the rush feature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I now found myself amidst a mass of speculation</seg><seg type="columnLine">which led me nowhere. I wondered whether Elon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already cornered Gaudet, whether Krampdorff was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marseilles and what red ring might be associated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and again I repeated the singular wording of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the advertisement which Margulier was setting up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But involuntarily my thoughts came back to condemn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flocon for his half-veiled willingness to allow Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">'baule to appear unprotected as champion of order. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught her name in the two-inch head of a newsboy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, and found the entire front page of Le Travail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Icur given over to a raging protest against the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prietor of Sunshine Park. One paragraph was out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in its virulence:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jacobi deserves ruin, for against the tide of the People's</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward rush he arranges a Denbaule demonstration. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular favorite is a thousand times a traitor in directing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence against the masses whose acclamations have raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to the pinnacle. We earnestly hope that Denbaule will</seg><seg type="columnLine">cease her misguided efforts; but, if she continues, the sacrifice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a superb artist will not be too much to further our cause."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I was still some distance from the park I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great steel spire towering in the air, and knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it must be the thriller which had created a sensa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion when installed a week previously in the pleasure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden, modeled after the resorts of New York. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I approached the entrance I saw the lofty shaft begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swing slowly through the air, and I speculated</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the probable sensations of the two passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">who swayed back and forth on the tip of a slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">spire as tall as a three-story building. I forced my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through a dense throng chattering volubly about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approaching Denbaule appearance and found Elon</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the South entrance. He was watching a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharging arrows at a live pigeon tethered by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-foot rope to the tip of a fiag-pole, at a franc for</seg><seg type="columnLine">five shots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not such bad shots, these Frenchmen," he remarked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They have had to change the pigeon four times in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last half--" He stopped suddenly, as a loud roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from the mob which thronged the grounds. "Ah,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I couldn't stop her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I followed his gaze to the clubhouse veranda, across</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which a small party was making its way towards the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">steps. Even with my view obstructed by the hats,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which filled all open spaces between amusement booths,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I recognized Denbaule's loose hair and large eyes. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crowd gave way to permit the passage of the little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">party, while a shrill-voiced barker continued his shout-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ride the Swaying Thriller! Get the vibration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a life-time! Feel the new sensation! Step right up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buy your tickets! One more ride before Denbaule</seg><seg type="columnLine">sings!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The group had now reached the entrance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrator. I recognized Valonne at Denbaule's side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I had never seen the dapper Jew. Elon whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was Jacobs, manager of the resort. I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quick exchange of recognition between Elon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denbaule, and knew that his morning program had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded an interview with her. She made a striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure, for she held her slender body erect, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">white shoulders and slim neck shone in sharp relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">above a dark dress over-netted with black lace. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">black eyes flashed fearless greeting to the workmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">who pressed about, and she smiled gaily; but I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark circles under her eyes and remembered her almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">incessant activity of the past three weeks. The party</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared into a tall wooden structure which rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the side of the towering spire, and I turned my</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the novel amusement device from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denbaule was scheduled to sing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The lofty steel shaft rose vertically to a height of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fully sixty-five feet above the concrete foundation in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which it was fixed. It was about four feet thick at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the base, and from this width it tapered upwards as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a slim pyramid. The tip of the spire bore a canopied</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">structure large enough to hold easily the two chairs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which were fastened to it, one at each side of the pole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Close to the bottom, fifteen feet from the ground, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">largest electro-magnet I had ever seen was built into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a massive foundation. The magnet must have weighed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two tons, and I reflected upon the immensity of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">magnetic force which would be required to deflect the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">huge column and so start its vibrations. At the side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the shaft stood a tall, slender wooden structure con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taining an elevator, obviously for the purpose of con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">veying passengers to the platform near the tip of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the spire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a weird contrivance," I remarked to Elon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Spectacular, perhaps, but how anyone can enjoy--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Andrews, you should use your imagination," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted. "It embodies motion, novelty and sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">change, which are at the root of every successful</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement device. When I was a boy I used to sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">perched in the top of a tall Lombardy poplar over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking the bay, and as the wind blew I swayed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forth and dreamed of adventures way off beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rolling sea--where we are now, Andrews. Jacobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">executed a stroke of vision when he commercialized</seg><seg type="columnLine">this familiar sensation. But I can't quite understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">why he risks the popularity of his resort by arrang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this counter-strike demonstration. Hear that mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An ominous rumble superseded the varied exclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, and I looked up to see the figure of Denbaule</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing at ease on the platform high in the air. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge Newfoundland dog stood looking down gravely</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the edge of the platform. Jacobs stepped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denbaule's side and motioned for silence, but the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VIBRATOR OF! DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">263</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">censed crowd was in no mood for introductory re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks. He hesitated, but Denbaule made an impera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive gesture and we saw the gangplank lowered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">form a bridge from the platform to the ledge at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of the chairs on the tip of the spire. Two at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendants strapped Denbaule into one of the uphol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stered chairs and the dog into the other at her back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gangplank rose, and Denbaule lifted her ostrich</seg><seg type="columnLine">fan in signal to the operator on the ground. I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">across to the enclosure and saw him close the switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the electro-magnet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Involuntarily the crowd burst into cheers as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">free end of the steel tree began to swing slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air, but leaders among them hissed loudly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the cheering stopped. In a few seconds the mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">net had brought the swaying column to its full ampli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude, and Denbaule rocked back and forth with gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythm. The motion reminded me of a long rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing turned upside down to defy the laws of gravity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Denbaule moved at high speed in the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arc and then gradually slowed down until at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of each swing she changed direction so gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I knew there could be no strain upon the straps</seg><seg type="columnLine">which held her safely in her lofty perch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the crowd hushed to listen, and the mel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low tones of the soprano floated down upon a scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quiet as the interior of a bank vault. Instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">directing her song towards heaven, as I had seen her</seg><seg type="columnLine">do on the stage, Denbaule was now bending forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as the straps would permit, and she sang</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Prayer from La Tosca directly into the upturned</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears of a larger audience than she had ever before</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded. She reached the end of her song, held</seg><seg type="columnLine">her gaze steadfast upon the crowd for a full thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds, then spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My poor countrymen, are you hungry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No reply was ventured. The tip of the rod swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to its other limit, returned, then Denbaule spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are your aged parents comfortable?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time there were a few rough cries. "No! No!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the leaders had recovered their wits and wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break the spell; but Denbaule continued, at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the next swing of the lofty vibrator, which thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to punctuate her simple remarks with dramatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphasis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are your children suffering?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," came in stronger chorus, then one loud "oice</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted, "We want the money of the parasites, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">want--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then why don't you go back to work and earn it</seg><seg type="columnLine">honestly?" came the reply, smooth and clear, yet as</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of feeling as if straight from the heart without</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing through the throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The raucous voice attempted to answer, but a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred approving shouts ascended to down out the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jector. Elon grasped my elbow and pointed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip of the vibrating spire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See--it's speeding up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE dashed off and I saw him struggling furiously to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make way through the crowd. The rough work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingmen whom he thrust aside mistook him for a protes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant against their beloved singer, and I saw his prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress impeded by a dozen hands. I tried to follow but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surging mass was ■ impenetrable. Before my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gentle sway of the huge vibrator had become a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerking shake. I could not make out Denbaule's ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression as she swished back and forth in shorter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter arcs, and faster and faster. She shrieked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more poignantly than I had ever heard, and the dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her back howled piteously. The crowd stared aghast</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the tragedy taking place before its eyes. Jacobs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped to the front of the platform and called ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citedly to the operator on the ground. I looked over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the enclosure and saw that the operator had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I struggled fruitlessly to get to the switch, but saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elon finally vault inside the enclosure and shut it off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denbaule's cries had ceased, and now jets of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurted from nose and mouth every time the violent</seg><seg type="columnLine">reversal of motion occurred at the ends of the short</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc in which she swished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually the motion slackened. The great shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod came finally to rest and eager attendants lifted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious girl from her chair. Even at that dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance I could see that the delicate oval of her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was streaked with red. Quickly she was brought down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the elevator, and a doctor from the crowd pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced her dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All was now confusion, but the awed exclamations</seg><seg type="columnLine">on every side showed that even in death the beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful singer had served the cause she fought for, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was evident that the reaction which Flocon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipated would set in by the next morning. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">set expression on Elon's face showed that even he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the tragedy deeply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was five minutes after we reached our room be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he spoke. Then his tone was one of bitter self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should have had Valonne lock her up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how could anyone foresee such an accident?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing happens without a cause, Andrews, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Denbaule was so hated in certain quarters--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused, then lit his pipe and snatched his hat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They have given us something more definite, now, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can only read the signs." He even smiled, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we strode rapidly towards Valonne's headquarters he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked me suddenly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you order the dodgers?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Margulier promised them for ten tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the type?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ten-point caps, bold face."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good.

Elon</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung it freely in the center of the carriage, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">started the motor and gradually advanced the control.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The carriage oscillated to and fro with increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, so that the bag swung against one end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriage and then the other. Water squirted from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valve at each bump. As the oscillations became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more rapid, the force of the bumps increased, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally the bag burst. Elon's eye lit, but he said only:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A striking demonstration of inertia, Professor. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand thanks for your kindness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You saw what would happen to a human heart?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked, as we were again in our room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean the experiment with the rubber bag?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Exactly. As soon as the speed of the thriller</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a certain limit the changes of direction at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends of the swings were so sudden that Denbaule's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart was bumped forcibly against the walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoracic cavity, and finally the valves burst. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">recall the spurts of blood?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw it all in a flash, but he was speaking again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now we know that the effect of vibrating too rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly could easily be predicted. Here is the next step."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had erected a thin rod of spring steel vertically</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a wooden base. He connected a dry cell to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electro-magnet at the bottom, and the rod swayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth. It was, in fact, a miniature Swaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thriller. Occasionally he changed the position of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding weight which he had clamped to the rod, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took observations with a stop-watch. I observed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearer the weight was to the tip, the more slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rod vibrated, but while I was trying to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">some connection, he rose quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now to examine the shaft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The park lay in complete darkness when we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, but nevertheless Elon maneuvered cautiously before</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaling a fence near the looming spire. He took a coil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of insulated wire from his grip, quickly climbed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole and connected the wires to the two power lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">which fed the park. He brought the loose ends to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, attached two rods, then in a trice was ascend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the narrow' ladder attached to the steel column.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">At intervals he tapped cautiously with a hammer, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw a blinding flash as he touched the rods together</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the side of the shaft. I knew that he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">melting a hole through the steel with his electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc and platinum electrodes which had been of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">service in the Fulton Bank case. He withdrew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrodes, inserted calipers, and called:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "8.2 centimeters; take it down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made measurements at intervals of six feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I tabulated the figures that he gave me. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned quickly to the ground after the last measure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, disconnected the wires, packed his tools and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the hotel, where he plunged into calculations</seg><seg type="columnLine">which covered sheet after sheet. I watched for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, interested in the curious symbols, but finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw myself upon the bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was nine in the morning when I awoke, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric lights were still burning brightly and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpet was covered with a deep layer of penciled papers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elon bent over the table, a cup of black coffee at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow. I heard him murmur:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "13.5, too low, too low--but there's nothing else."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You snored fearfully," he exclaimed, looking to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards me. "Get those dodgers this morning and meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">me for dinner at the Palais Crystal, at six-thirty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He jammed his hat on his head and strode out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving me to speculate upon the significance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure 13.5. Margulier had the dodgers ready promptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at ten, and as I returned to the hotel I heard news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys crying the tragedy. One paragraph especially in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested me:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Government engineers testified that such a shaft can vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brate at only one speed, which is determined entirely by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigidity and distribution of weight; and they set up apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">which showed that the only effect of the magnet is to main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain the natural rate of the rod. Their testimony proved that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accident was due to crystallization of the steel under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous stresses involved. Examination of the shaft this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning revealed a scries of small holes apparently made with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a welding torch, but these were held to have had no effect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The manager of the park, Mr. Jacobs, as well as the inventor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prof. J. Langevon, were completely exonerated, and the shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">is being strengthened for an early re-opening."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elon was taciturn at supper, merely stating that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would have an interesting expedition during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening, and I wondered whether, after all, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">any connection between Denbaule's death and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">venomous propaganda. We smoked leisurely until nine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the colorful diners seated under the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">canopy of the sidewalk cafe; then Valonne called with</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of his men, and the five of us motored out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road that skirted the bay. Elon watched the shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely and halted us in a cluster of trees about four</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour later a heavy truck stopped directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite our hiding place. Four men alighted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged two cylinders to the water-front. The moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light shone upon them as they attached a long hose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the nozzle of each tank; then we heard the muffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheezing of pressure suddenly released. The breeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought a pungent odor to our nostrils, and Elon</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered laconically:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chlorine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he pressed the key of a small wireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">sender in the automobile, and almost immediately a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted launch moved closer to shore. The four men</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped work with sharp ejaculations of disappoint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, hastily re-loaded the cylinders and turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck towards town. We trailed them at a safe dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lumbering truck led us straight to Sunshine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Park. Elon cautiously followed them towards the club-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, then motioned us to come on. He led us into</seg><seg type="columnLine">what seemed to be an employee's entrance and halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside a sink in a basement lavatory. Stooping, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VIBRATOR OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">265</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fingered among the pipes leading down from the sink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then in the semi-gloom we saw a small door swing in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards. Elon wriggled through the narrow opening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we followed him down the large corridor into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had emerged. He held up a hand in warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, then darted at full speed around the corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four men jumped as if shot, only to face five leveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolvers. Elon advanced quickly and handcuffed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four two by two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think this is all of them, Valonne," remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elon, with a smile of satisfaction, "but your men</seg><seg type="columnLine">might guard that entrance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked again at the four men who stood against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall. One I recognized immediately as Jacobs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager of the resort. Manacled to him was an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mensely tall and emaciated man, clad in a dignified</seg><seg type="columnLine">black frock coat. His singularly bearded and massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">head towered above the cringing Jew at his side. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men were garbed as workers, with bare forearms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dirty hands. Their faces revealed merely the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolid indifference of stupidity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elon walked quickly to the single typecase that stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two hand-presses, and fitted every letter from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the compartments into a printer's type-assembler.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He mounted the type in a form, ran off a proof and</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined it eagerly under his glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Valonne, the case is now complete," he remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "You may arrest Jacobs, Krampdorff and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ' two helpers as murderers and revolutionary</seg><seg type="columnLine">plotters."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a lie!" shouted Jacobs, his face blanched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees sagging, but Krampdorff said coolly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear Professor Hopkins, perhaps you will tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">us by what right you enter our private workroom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">address us as murderers?

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will trace the evidence briefly. I had no sooner come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Marseilles than I noticed the dodgers which Jacobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">had issued to advertise Sunshine Park, and I observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same peculiarly ragged scratch across the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one capital E that I had seen in the revolutionary</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodgers. You are aware, of course, that under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">microscope such minute scratches are as distinctive</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the finger-print of criminals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naturally this aroused my suspicion, Valonne, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you informed me that the printer whose name ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared at the bottom of the amusement dodgers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just been raided without result. The obvious conclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion was that the printer of the amusement dodgers</seg><seg type="columnLine">was using Marguiler's name as a blind. In order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">test this point I had dodgers, overloaded with E's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">printed at Margulier's shop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He exhibited one of the furrier dodgers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will note, Valonne, the preponderance of E's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In average copy the percentage of E's is slightly under</seg><seg type="columnLine">9; so I judged that 24 per cent, almost 1 in every 4 let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters, would exhaust his small stock of type and thus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">show whether the scratched E was in his possession.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The microscope reveals no evidence of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This was sufficient to center suspicion upon Sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine Park, but in the meantime the murder had oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred. A simple experiment proved that a skillful</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist could easily predict the physiological effect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrating too rapidly. It is well known that the rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vibration of a rigid shaft depends only upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigidity and distribution of weight. I found by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematical investigation that 3,798 pounds of ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial must be removed from the upper part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft in order to increase its rate from 30 to 180</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations per minute which were the values I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted at the park, and the double fact that the acceler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation had occurred gradually and in public indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this material must have flowed down from the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior of the shaft after being released by a timed</seg><seg type="columnLine">valve. I found that the upper half of the shaft con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained a hollow space of 4.5 cubic feet, and by simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">division I ascertained that the material removed must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have weighed 844 pounds to the cubic foot. In other</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, its density with 13.5. There is no liquid possess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing exactly this density; but mercury, commonly known</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quicksilver, has a density of 13.6, and I concluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">that perhaps the hollow space had not been truly</seg><seg type="columnLine">conical, as I had assumed in my calculations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The simplest method of removing this mercury</seg><seg type="columnLine">while thousands were looking was to allow it to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sewer, so I expected to find it at the outlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that particular trunk, fifty feet west of Pointe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cochon. It was quite clear that we were dealing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminals of the highest intellectual calibre, so I antici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pated an effort to remove the mercury from the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">depression on the bottom of the bay at the sewer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, where the metallic fluid must remain on ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of its density. You know the remaining details,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valonne. Our auxiliary on the launch interrupted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical experiment of these worthies, which con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted simply in pumping compressed chlorine gas into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pool of mercury. The mercuric chloride formed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemical reaction would dissolve in the surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Thus your men will find some mercury left as</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence and perhaps some dead fish, also, floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the surface of the water; for mercuric chloride,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolved in water, is a deadly poison."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Gaudet?" stammered Valonne, completely dumb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">founded by Elon's rapid fire of revelations.	_</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mav wire Camproger to beware of Gaudet s</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground political activities; but, as regards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">complications of the last few weeks, Gaudet does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">possess the requisite mental acumen. And Valonne,</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued Elon, glancing at Jacobs, "you may find</seg><seg type="columnLine">this pamphlet useful in your case against Jacobs. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had run across it sooner in the library I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been spared the trouble of solving an excessively diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult differential equation.

Holding a course near the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean of air which must have been parallel with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curvature of the Earth, it sped northwest. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blood-red streak it was traveling across the darken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sky.

Almost immediately they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were joined by thousands from the land. Straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">up they rose with astonishing swiftness. Mighty tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopes in huge observatories at various elevated points</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Earth had picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and counted them--</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred and one in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all--and studied them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they drew near.

Water could not exist in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid state on any of those satellites because the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">they received from their primaries and from Vega was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too great.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Around Formalhaut, too, were many planets, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one which approached nearest in its resemblance to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth was still in an early evolutionary state that fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed close upon the formation of a crust over a molten</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior--the eruptive stage.

The phys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icians could do nothing for the remnant of the crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">still surviving; they could only look on and make their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick as comfortable as possible. In some respects the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease resembled leprosy. As it neared its final stage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumps of flesh rotted and fell from the living frame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The physicians and scientists worked feverishly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Months went by and they seemed to make no progress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crew were the first to go, then the physicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">succumbed. Not until nearly all of the physicians and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists who had boarded the ship--they had all con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted the disease within the first forty-eight hours--</seg><seg type="columnLine">had died from it after years of tireless research, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disease finally arrested and finally conquered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of an antitoxin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                               fT,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE story that the crew gave out to the world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this: when the ten mighty interstellar ships drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">near Sirius they slackened their speed a little until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they neared the outermost planet revolving around that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright star. From a great height they circled it. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere was hardly worthy of note. Man could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not live upon that world, not unless he brought his</seg><seg type="columnLine">air with him. The next three planets, in order, to Sirius</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also unfit for human habitation for various rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons. There was something familiar about the fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">outermost planet. It had a ring around it that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled Saturn's, composed of myriads of tiny moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets. That fifth outermost planet also had an exten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ships drew swiftly near that world. It had the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of a wondrous jewel, worthy of all hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships. From the angle at which they were approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the ring looked like two handles by which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirian world could be grasped. The moonlets which</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed that ring ranged from a few hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in diameter to about five miles. The larger masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ring were nearly all globular.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hazy patches, which later became more distinct and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seen to be great bodies of water and land, seas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and continents, could be made out on the surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drawing nearer, light and darker areas, barren tracts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and regions covered with vegetation, stood out. Wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rivers and lakes could also be seen. Still nearer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">large cities in the midst of the darker areas and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shores of the seas came into view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One after the other at the intervals of a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so the ten interstellar ships shot into its atmosphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The friction of their passage through the most rare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied part of the gaseous envelope caused them to glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">red. Almost as soon as they entered the atmosphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of tiny ships of air leapt up from the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of both land and water in an effort to attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ten ships that had come from out of the void, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were traveling too high and too fast. From each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tiny ships of air there came bright flashes as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were discharging weapons which resembled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient artillery of man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crossing high over one of the cities in their path,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first interstellar ship in the lead dropped a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower to see what manner-of intelligent creatures built</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inhabited it. The city, it was seen, was composed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of huge masses of masonry; in its center were a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses larger than the rest. And as the ship drew near</seg><seg type="columnLine">those larger masses of masonry a strange beam of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen different blending hues leapt up and touched it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though it was traveling at a high velocity, the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a stop as if it had struck a slightly yielding</seg><seg type="columnLine">but impenetrable barrier. It could neither go forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor draw back. For a moment it hung motionless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then began to drop slowly down as if it were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled by some powerful magnetic force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The interstellar ship, with its driving rays that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful enough to hurtle it along at two-thirds the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of light, turned on full, tried to rise, to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the force that was drawing it down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of that world, but it could not. There was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny resemblance to a fly being caught securely</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sticky strands of a spider's web. Lower it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn and still lower. The other nine ships could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. From other parts of the city there gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth the same strange beams of blending light and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nine interstellar ships swerved from their course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those aboard this ship began to realize their danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their driving rays could not free them. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very near the tops of the masses of masonry which</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed the city. They got a confused view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants, creatures nearly all arms and legs, scramb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling away from the danger zone. Hardly a mile above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mass of masonry from which the beam came, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers in command of that ship ordered a few of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest bombs to be dropped. There was a roar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mass of masonry directly underneath the ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown to bits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The force which had been drawing the interstellar</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship down disappeared with the destruction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure. It started to rise, but it did not get far,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it was instantly set upon by thousands of ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">which clung to its surface like iron filings on a mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">net. Their weight drew it low again. Near the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the city there was a large cleared space and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers who clung to the interstellar ship were</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to draw it down to that spot. Before it reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND SWARM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">271</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A door was slid half open in the side of the interstellar ship and . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man appeared in the opening. Seeing tho ships of air drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">near, he made motions with his hands for them to keep away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They seemed to pay no attention to his signs, and continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw near. From the shore, thousands of men and women were</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting off toward the ship in every kind of available craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, there was a mighty explosion and a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">flare of blinding light, and a dense cloud of smoke and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust rose high in the air. The interstellar ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small ships of air that clung to it were destroyed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no sign of the city, except a deep hole in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, where the city stood. Whether the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion came from the interstellar ship or from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships of that world, it was impossible to say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nine remaining interstellar ships, as they con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued on their course around the new world, gave all</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities a wide berth after that, for the fate of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sister ship made them keep a sharp lookout. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled as fast and as high as possible. Whenever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw any beams of light point heavenwards they swerved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE intelligent inhabitants of the Sirian world</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed amply prepared against invaders. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons and the relentlessness with which they at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked the nine interstellar ships were beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry the leaders. They were allowed no respite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crossing over some low mountain ranges, guns roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth from below, a few of the projectiles striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly on the bottom of the ships. There were other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships on a sea, also armed with great guns, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept up a steady firing as long as they could. Near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a fertile plain, thousands of tiny ships of air rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bar their progress. Everything that moved, anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had any height, carried weapons and used them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an effort to destroy the ships from our mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half way around that planet the visitors came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert, in the middle of which were two mighty inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar ships such as the scouting expedition which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the Earth for Sirius long before. That explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything to the commanders of the ships from Earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was the reason for the Satellite's preparedness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The interstellar ships, all except one which was ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cruise about and keep watch for any suspicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs, dropped to the surface near the two ships to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn whose fate they had come all the way from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The inhabitants of the strange world guessed rightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ten interstellar ships had not come just for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pleasure of it. That world was so well prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense that they must have been expecting them. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">they been watching the approach of the interstellar</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships as they came within the glare of their sun?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardly. The ships traveled so swiftly that it was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most impossible to see them. Then again they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not possibly have prepared themselves so well in so</seg><seg type="columnLine">short a space of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The region seemed utterly deserted. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of man. Nothing moved near the two ships. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not look as if any of the creatures of the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">found world had ever neared it. One, broken and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted as if it had been dealt a terrific blow, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying on its side, the other rested right side up as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had come down with some one still at the controls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the form of a ring the eight ships slowly settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the two wrecks. At the least sign of anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious they were ready to shoot up into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens, rapidly regaining speed. The atmosphere wa*</seg><seg type="columnLine">272</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tested and found fit to breathe. From each of the eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships a number of the crew and inmates armed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth, came forth to investigate the two interstellar</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships that had many years ago carried the scouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition to Sirius. They approached warily. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly the wide doors on the ship, which was lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">right side up, opened and fan-shaped streams of all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">devouring flame swept over the men, destroying them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all before they could even threw themselves flat upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men aboard the interstellar ships who were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard gave warning and the eight ships began to rise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In an instant the whole region became alive. Square</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of masonry rose jerkily from below the surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They covered the whole region for miles near the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranded interstellar ships, and from the rising masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of masonry the mouths of guns could be seen, bom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barding the eight interstellar ships, destroying them</seg><seg type="columnLine">one by one before they could rise more than their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">length. The interstellar ship which was cruising about</seg><seg type="columnLine">high in the heavens took alarm and started to speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. A great gun stuck its mouth up from below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface and poured a silent stream of projectiles to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the speeding ship. A few of the missiles pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated into the chambers where the crew were. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hollow, containing a vapor-like substance under</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure which was rushing forth steadily from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of minute holes. Men grabbed the missiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw them into tanks containing water. The ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out of range before any great damage was done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A year after the ship left the ringed world which</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled Sirius, a terrible disease broke out among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operating crew. The disease-germs were traced to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectiles which had been fired into the ship as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped away from the attack. All on board were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected, and they began to succumb one by one. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserve crew were at last awakened from their state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of suspended animation and took over the duties of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. They, too, contracted the disease. At last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship reached the Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Years passed. The Second Great Expedition, also a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible punitive expedition, now had a goal in view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Preparations of the expedition down to the most min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute detail were completed. The creatures who lived on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the satellite which circled about Sirius would be sorry</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ever attacked man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had those intelligent creatures who inhabited the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringed world of Sirius not attacked and destroyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two expeditions from Earth, man, on discovering that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was in sole possession of highly intelligent creatures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have dreamt of invading it, but now . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE beginning of the following year the expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">would start. A few more months and the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">would dawn. The men and women who were to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">were given a final round of training and then sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">home to spend the remaining days with their families.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The months dwindled down to one month, the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">month to a week, the week to one day more--tomorrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was impossible for sleep to come to any one on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this particular night, for the night was being kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrantly awake by the incessant hum of countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices, like that of angry bees, that rose and fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chill night air. It came from the great dwellings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">light streaming from each window, that towered up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and up into the night until they seemed to merge as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one with the star-flecked sky overhead, huge piles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel and masonry that housed on the average of five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand families to the building. It came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">many different street levels and wide recreation squares</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were swiftly becoming crowded with people, mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">young. It came from the very air overhead through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which youth was flashing on the wing. It was every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, a throbbing murmur of mingled weeping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter in which laughter was slowly becoming more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more pronounced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On this night, as on that other memorial night, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of families were experiencing the sharp pangs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of parting with their loved ones who were leaving upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great adventure. They would most likely not return.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For those who were going, as always, the thrill; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who were to remain, the heartache. In nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">each and every apartment of those who were going,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were real tears and forced laughter and wishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of good luck. Some mothers tried bravely to hide their</seg><seg type="columnLine">real feelings, but their laughter, plainly forced, jarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their nerves; others wept bitterly and yet clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">harder to those who were leaving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All over the Earth it was the same, east or west,</seg><seg type="columnLine">south or north, the members of the Second Great Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedition were taking their last leave of their parents,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their brother and sisters and friends who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">either too old or too young or physically unfit to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">company them on this stupendous adventure, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being launched into that boundless void of space</seg><seg type="columnLine">out beyond the bounds of the solar system. Keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sakes, locks of hair, and every imaginable remedy for</seg><seg type="columnLine">pains and wounds were being thrust upon them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sides and steadfastly refused as they personally</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed their slender kits. Only pictures of those whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would probably never see again in flesh were be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing reverently placed away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this activity was like that of a busy hive of over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded bees preparing to swarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The order had gone forth that every one must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready at his appointed place an hour after dawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since they were old enough to walk they were drilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now they were ready. That order only applied to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rank and file of the expedition. The officers, trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly in the recently resurrected art of warfare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gathered from the four corners of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">months before for the last practice trips out into space</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the interstellar ships. They were now gathered to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether for their final instructions. A high standard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">physically and mentally, was demanded of the officers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In their hands would rest the fate of the expedition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The officers had also to go through the ceremony of</seg><seg type="columnLine">swearing allegiance en viasse to the quota leaders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each zone--a most impressive ceremony, that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark the official end, as far as the authorities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth were concerned, to all further responsibilities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Second Great Expedition. From that moment on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be entirely in the hands of the six military</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaders and their six hundred thousand officers. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition was not, like the first, one of peace settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment on far-off worlds beyond the bounds of the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system; this was an expedition of conquest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the hundred and twenty-first century of the New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Era the world was divided into three zones of almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal land surface and inhabited by the three great</seg><seg type="columnLine">divisions of man; the White, the Yellow, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black. Each zone was inhabited by the race which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could best stand the climate. The zones were named</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the color of the inhabitants. The Black Zone</seg><seg type="columnLine">was situated at the equator, a wide swath of land</seg><seg type="columnLine">above and below the limits of the Black Zone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known as the Yellow Zone, while the White Zone ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. The regions</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the limits of the territory alloted to the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">races on the north and south to the poles belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally to the three divisions of mankind. The world's</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest mines were situated up there. Man looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the north and south as his two great storehouses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of raw materials. Most of the raw materials needed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND SWARM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">273</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">used by him came from the land of the midnight sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The polar regions were also two immense underground</seg><seg type="columnLine">factories, which supplied the world with all of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger manufactured articles of metal and glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From each of the zones had been drawn an equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">quota of boys and girls--now men and women--of</seg><seg type="columnLine">high physical and mental standard. In the years that</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed they were assigned to vocations for which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tests showed they were best fitted and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained thoroughly in the various trades, professions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sciences. Besides their vocations, the rank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">file of the expedition were trained, as a secondary con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideration, in the art of warfare; but the officers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied, primarily, the art of maneuvering the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">interstellar ships, which were to carry the forces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expedition and to handle their terrible weapons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction, to lead their forces on landing and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their example of utter disregard for life spur them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their conquest of that ringed satellite revolving</seg><seg type="columnLine">around bright Sirius.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Six were selected from among the officers to lead the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition, three of each sex, one for each quota. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">six leaders-to-be were selected for their mental qual-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ities to command and lead their quotas as other youths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the expedition were selected and trained in the oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupations for which they were best fitted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few more brief hours and the day for which man</seg><seg type="columnLine">has waited for many years will have dawned. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">night was still young. It was being whispered with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing smile that man would have a wild celebration</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight, and for many nights to come. Every one would</seg><seg type="columnLine">participate, the old and the young; those who were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay as well as the youths who were to go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was there any wonder, then, that those who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go should try to tear themselves away as quickly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could? For they, with the utter thoughtlessness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of youth, wanted to be out and enjoy the mad revelry</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this night which many were hinting about. Didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">they deserve it? They had trained and trained for</seg><seg type="columnLine">years; little enjoyment had they gotten out of life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this was to be their last night of freedom on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth. Besides, they wanted to get over the painful</seg><seg type="columnLine">scenes of parting as quickly as possible and be out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their comrades. Those who were to be left behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">held on to them more tightly as the clocks ticked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding minutes away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The different levels of the wide avenues and narrower</seg><seg type="columnLine">side streets were already thronged with crowds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing-eyed boys and girls--members of the expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in their centers--, while sober-eyed men and wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men stood watching from the windows. The ages of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who were to go ranged from twenty to twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">four. Only those so young could go; for the journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take more than thirteen long years, time enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them to mature. But they did not seem to worry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were happy, extremely hilarious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their overbubbling laughter was but youth's natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebound of spirits from their heart-wrenching part-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings at home. They never expected to see any member</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their respective families again, unless they caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of them as they marched past them on the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">review tomorrow, because from that display they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">march directly to the various underground railway de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pots that would take them to the far north and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far south where their interstellar ships were in readi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness--long, slender vehicles that were fully provisioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take them on their terrific voyage to the neighbor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood of Sirius and the ringed world that revolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">around it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arm in arm, ten and more abreast, with one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the expedition in the middle, they swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down the different levels, talking, laughing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">singing--excitedly happy. Those who wore the white;</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow, and black uniforms were scheduled to start at</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight tomorrow.

It was the same in every city and town of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any size. The different street levels and recreation</seg><seg type="columnLine">squares were becoming packed to the point of suffoca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

On the following day the Second Great Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedition was scheduled to be launched into the bound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less infinity of space toward Sirius. The First Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Expedition had gone toward Alpha Centauri and met</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no opposition. They had peacefully taken posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of the two worlds which their scouts had selected</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the only two fit for human habitation. Their ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not filled with weapons for destruction, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools for construction. To each who had braved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrors of the unknown there had been allotted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand acres of the choicest land upon the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those worlds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be different, though, for those who com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised the Second Great Expedition. This would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no peaceful settlement. The ringed world, the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet around Sirius, was inhabited by intelligent crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. The inhabitants of that world had proved them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves well prepared to defend their world against in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaders. Thousands of men had already lost their lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon that world, before one hostile move had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It became a matter of self-preservation. Upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of that ringed world there were a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">interstellar ships which the creatures had managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring down. Some were instantly destroyed, others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not. To creatures as intelligent as they un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly were the machinery within the interior of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those intersteller ships was not too intricate, nor the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving mechanism too hard to understand. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">race of man there were three reasons why their extinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was a vital necessity; they were too well prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for war, too near the solar system, too near level of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the wide first balcony of the recently erected</seg><seg type="columnLine">Academy of War, Thadeus, President of the Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zones, a spare, stately figure of a man grown old</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, stood watching the almost endless line of of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficers of the expedition, one hundred abreast, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew near the wide portals for the farewell address</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ceremony of swearing allegiance en masse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the six selected leaders. Proudly they carried them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. They moved as one. President Thadeus's kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet determined face lit up with pride--just pride, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he not devoted the major portion of his life to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preparation of the expedition? When Death had</seg><seg type="columnLine">called his predecessor, ably had he grasped the reins</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the cold hands had let go and brought the prepar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ations of the Second Great Expedition to a successful</seg><seg type="columnLine">termination. He had done yet more, he had personally</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken charge of the training of the officers. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">his duties were manifold, he never missed an oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to watch them and note their improvements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The recently erected Academy of War--which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been built primarily to teach the science of warfare to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the officers of the Second Great Expedition, stood in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolated spot far in front of the three governmental</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities which represented the three zones of Earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The three governmental cities were really one, divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">into three triangles and separated from each other by</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile-wide paved boulevards. The two paved boulevards</seg><seg type="columnLine">came together in front of the Academy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down one of the boulevards officers and men, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">marching. They were the officers of the Black Quota</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would be the first to enter. At the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers of the Black Zone strode their young com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander. He was distinguished from the rest of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers by a flaming-red silken crepe over his jet black</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform which was long enough to reach from shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">to heels and which fluttered out behind him as he moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">proudly forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The balcony upon which President Thadeus stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was five hundred feet above the paved surface below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Academy of War was the tallest building on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth.

The two leaders had over their</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniforms their flaming-red capes, the insignia of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zenofia towered over the other two on the balcony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stood five feet, eleven inches in height and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">had but to glance into her eyes to see why she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been selected to lead her quota. She possessed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence, determination which could surmount all ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacles, and the power to have her slightest command</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed without question. Ureena, in contrast,, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely five feet in height and built daintily. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">little they had in common except the power to lead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where the other would climb Ureena would go around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strategy, not determination, was her forte.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matilda, Commander of the White Female Quota,</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed the qualities of both besides a dash of reck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less daring. She was hovering near the balcony on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of individual flying wings which were strapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly upon her shoulders with a metal brace and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide straps. The flying wings were thin, reinforced</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal plates that could open and close like the feathers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wings of a bird. Each wing measured a fraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">over thirty-six inches, and was made of an aluminum</seg><seg type="columnLine">alloy that was much stronger than the finest steel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What the wings lacked in size they made up in power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the wings were operated by a powerful atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor that weighed only five pounds, yet could de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velop twenty horsepower with ease. The atomic motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could vibrate the wings as fast as the wings of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect vibrate. Over her head and fastened to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders she wore a conical helmet of transparent sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance that lessened the air-resistance and let her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe evenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Blacks had nearly all entered the great Academy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Yellows with their yellow uniforms were just</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming into view down the second boulevard. At their</seg><seg type="columnLine">head strode Keelen, Commander of the Yellow Male</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quota. Ureena, Commander of the Yellow Female</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quota, leaned over the balustrade to watch him through</seg><seg type="columnLine">her glasses a little better. They were betrothed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Commander Keelen at the head of his officers was ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching swiftly. No one could mistake him with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape of flaming-red silk that fluttered behind him, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">badge of leadership. Impulsively, Ureena called to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, though she did not expect him to hear.

Thadeus. who was standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two girl leaders, glanced down at her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled. Well did he know of their attachment for each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. It was one of the few things at which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered greatly. Her--their feeling for each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a throwback to when love, not eugenics, ruled</seg><seg type="columnLine">mating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through her glasses Ureena saw Keelen's head go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and his eyes begin to travel up the wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Academy of War to the first balcony upon which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. She waved her arms wildly to attract his at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention. She leaned over the balustrade a little too far</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lost her balance. With a startled shriek she slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the top of the balustrade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At her shrill cry President Thadeus turned his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw her falling. His hands darted out and caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red silken cape as it fluttered over. But the cape</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very thin and began to rip almost before it felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full strain at the other end. Zenofia, the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader, was more than a half dozen paces from Thadeus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the cry she too turned her head. She grasped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation instantly and began to run toward the falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. There was a slight chance that she might reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in time to put her hand through the openings</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the balustrade and catch hold of Ureena's clothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">before she fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matilda, the white leader, who was hovering near on</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing, heard the cry and realized that she must act at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once if the other was to be saved. The cape was part-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing swiftly. Zenofia was still four paces off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Ureena was not saved, the rank and file of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition--the masses even at this late date were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a measure superstitious--would consider it a dread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful omen. It would take the heart out of many. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the power to help if she could reach her in time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So almost as quick as a flash she plunged to the aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little yellow leader. But even before she sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own length she saw that the cape must break be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore she could possibly reach her. It seemed as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few whole threads in the cape were snapping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air seemed to quiver with chilled suspense. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp of the thousands of metal-shod feet below</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded as if they came from a distance immeasurably</seg><seg type="columnLine">far off, from a different world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matilda saw the face of Thadeus turn deathly pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he gazed at her and saw how far off she was. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the thud of flying feet behind him and glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">back out of the corner of his eye. Zenofia was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">three paces off. Glistening beads of sweat came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over his wrinkled face. The wings upon her back</seg><seg type="columnLine">were beating the air heavily to gain the momentum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She saw his lips frame the words:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Faster! Faster!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But still she was far off. Every fraction of an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant she was gaining speed. Would she be in time?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cape parted! With an awful despairing cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ureena plunged downward. Half of her flaming-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape fluttered behind her. Like a meteor she fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matilda reached the spot a second too late. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed of a shot she hurtled after her. The hum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal wings on her back grew shrill with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and their power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those on the ground level five hundred feet below</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the impending danger of the body that was hurtling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down toward them. They looked up. Those directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the balcony took in the full significance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy and started to draw back hastily. Those from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distance saw the white leader hurtle after the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a desperate effort to save. It seemed futile to them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet their breaths were tightly drawn in as they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">her increase her downward speed still more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Commander Keelen, who was glancing at the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">sculptured figure of Mars, the ancient god of war, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the main entrance to the Academy, not up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balcony as Ureena had imagined, also glanced up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Into the field of his vision flashed the bright yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform and the fluttering half of the flaming-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape. Only one on Earth had the right to that combin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation on this day. He started to run to the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly under, as if he could break the force of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall with his own body. He did not seem to realize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could never reach the spot in time, and if he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the force of her fall from that height would crush</seg><seg type="columnLine">them both to pulp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Faster and yet faster did Matilda drop in pursuit, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings on her back whining terribly as they forced her</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with the speed of a bullet. Her hands were out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched. Her body was as straight as an arrow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid. Only her fingers moved, opening and closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">spasmodically upon the empty air. Would she never</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach Ureena?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the tips of her fingers touched the fluttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of Ureena's cape, then it fluttered about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists, now her hands gripped cloth and held. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the thin silken half of the cape, but the sturdy</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow uniform underneath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wings, their action slowly reversed, braked their</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward rush and after a moment of poising began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw them both up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just a moment or so and it was over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From below there rose a roar as the seeming impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility was accomplished. A moment later the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lady who was snatched from death ran like</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildfire through the ranks of those below. Pandem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onium followed. Those below were mainly the officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Yellow Quota.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The look of gratitude that old Thadeus gave her as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she hovered over the balcony with her burden more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than repaid her for what she had done. President</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thadeus had always been like a fond father to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three female leaders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eager hands reached trembling for Ureena and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid her gently upon the marble floor of the balcony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She did not move. He bent his head to her breast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">detected the fluttering beat of her heart. He began</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroking her hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She uttered a long drawn-out sigh. Her eyelids</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivered for a moment and then opened wide. Wildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">she gazed about. Surprise was in her eyes as she real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized where she was and saw the familiar faces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those she knew, bent over her. It was plain to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did not expect to find herself in the land of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Physically she was none the worse for her narrow es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape. The scare that she received, however, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably make her afraid to venture upon high places</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She made an effort to speak, gulped, and then asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulously:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was it only a dream that I felt myself slipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the balustrade and falling to certain death on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stones below? Did I not really fall?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, child," Thadeus answered softly, "you did fall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you were saved by your white sister who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovering near on wing. You are not hurt, my child,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you?" he ended anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ureena shook her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her rescuer, who had perched herself on the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balustrade, waited to hear no more. She stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, turned her back on those on the balcony and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started her wings a-vibrating. The wings drew her</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, up until she was at the three thousand-foot level</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then she sped like an arrow toward the barracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND SWARM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">277</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where her thousands of girl captains were gathered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for her to come and lead them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She reached her own private quarters and changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her flying outfit for a snow-white uniform and cape</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flaming-red. Swiftly she opened the door leading out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her quarters and ra/'M for the lifts that were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry her down to the fourth street level. She sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the moving sidewalks until she was 011 the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one that traveled a mile-a-minute and took a seat. Five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later she was at the head of the female of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficers of the White Quota.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the door which let out to the first balcony of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Academy of War there came a scraping of metal-shod</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet on the marble threshold. The door was given a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy thud, it swayed outward but did not open. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded as though someone had staggered against it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The noise attracted the attention of those on the bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the face of President Thadeus there appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">a red flush of anger. What clumsy fool was out there</seg><seg type="columnLine">who could not see where he was going?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door was given another thud and swung open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A man appeared upon the threshold. He rocked back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forth upon his feet. He was panting painfully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a man who, disregarding or forgetting the fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">pneumatic lifts, had climbed the rarely used spiral</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairway on a run from the first street level.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you want?" one of the physicians de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man did not reply. His face was of a sickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow-greyish color and streaked with sweat. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were wild. Hardly able to stand, he staggered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Ureena lay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ureena held out her hands to him. Startled, Thad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eus recognized the man. It was Keelen, the co-leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Yellow forces. His yellow uniform was covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with dust from running up the spiral stairway, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">red silken cape was slashed to ribbons by the heels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his metal-shod feet as he leapt up the stairs three and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more at a time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keelen saw that her eyes were open and that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be unharmed. With a glad cry of relief he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself down upon his knees beside her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could not speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She reached up and stroked his face tenderly. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood. Words between them were unnecessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is she?" Ureena suddenly demanded, quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who?" Keelen asked tenderly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Matilda. I have not thanked her yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keelen shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thadeus volunteered the information that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left to rejoin her officers. It was growing late and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to the schedule, the White Quota of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Second Great Expedition, both male and female, had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be on their way north and south to the polar regions</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the next three hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can I repay her?" Ureena broke in. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not for myself that I value my life so, but for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keelen," Thadeus said slowly, "it is time for you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take your place at the head of your officers in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">auditorium below.

They moved swiftly to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the lifts, Commander Zenofia and the physicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">going down to the moving platforms below the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">level, while President Thadeus went up to his suite to</seg><seg type="columnLine">don his raiment for the ceremony at which he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">officiate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later President Thadeus stepped into one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fast pneumatic lifts at the two thousand foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">level upon which his suite was situated and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly down. At the thousand foot level he stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked out through the transparent sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage. His eyes slowly took in the details of the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">auditorium of the Academy of War. He could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the thousand foot height that half of the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense auditorium which was reserved for the male</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers of the Second Great Expedition was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed, every one of the three hundred thousand seats</seg><seg type="columnLine">was occupied, while the other half which was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served for the female officers was rapidly filling up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then his eyes traveled up, up to the thirty-second bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cony and took in the thousands of the leading men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women of Earth from all three zones who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting there patiently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he touched the button and the lift sank to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred and fifty foot level on which stood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaker's box just above the middle stage of the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">great stages underneath. As he made his way from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift along a glass-enclosed gallery to the same box he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pleased to see Commander Keelen, with a new cape</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flaming-red silk, on his raised seat facing the Yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low officers. The two other commanders were also there</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their raised seats. The white, yellow, and black</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniforms set each quota off distinctly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next he turned his eyes toward the other side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that Commander Matilda was already seated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of her officers. Commauder Zenofia of the Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">legions was also there with her officers. The female</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers of the Yellow Quota, who should have followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White forces into the Academy, were just entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred abreast, and at their head proudly moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commander Ureena.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as they were all seated, President Thadeus</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the signal. Slowly the solemn ceremony of swear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Allegiance to the six leaders was gotten under</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Then after he finished reading his farewell ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress, added:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For well over two hundred years the people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth have labored unceasingly for this day.

Long, long ago man adopted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his own one of the primary laws of the social order</seg><seg type="columnLine">of insects and followed unswervingly their example of</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing the race high above themselves, their work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own petty ambitions. To you who are going will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the glory, to them, the toil.

Perhaps it was the strengthening power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that will added to their own determination which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">held them to their course until success crowned their</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts. True, they had nothing to contend with as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will have, and the only risks they ran were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary risks which attend the crossing of inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar spaces. Yet without that accompanying will</seg><seg type="columnLine">and resolution they might have lost heart before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were halfway toward their destination when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">blundered into the head of a dark comet. They lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of ships. Had they been on the lookout that</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident would not have befallen them.

The lens were built</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">up of separate sections and somewhat resembled the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound eye of an insect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vehicles were all constructed of a special alloy</seg><seg type="columnLine">which could withstand the extremes of temperature</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the least expansion and contraction. The alloy</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not, under the most adverse conditions, rust or</seg><seg type="columnLine">corrode. All the vehicles had three separate walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The space between the walls was exhausted of air and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so formed a two-fold vacuum that would insulate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior from the cold of the void between the stars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once the men were within, three massive air-tight doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed each of the eight entrances into the ship's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">280</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From many underground railway depots the men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expedition had started marching up to the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the polar regions where the interstellar ships lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">half buried in pits of packed snow and ice. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men were oflicerless, there was not the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion. As soon as they reached the surface, in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">orderly fashion that plainly told of long days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">training, they formed into ranks a score abreast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched to the interstellar ships, each body of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its assigned place. Every interstellar ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbered with gigantic numerals, and the guides to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were roads of snow packed to icy hardness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Physicians, not belonging to the expedition, but hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a vital duty to perform before its departure, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived during the preceding week from all parts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world and had taken up temporary quarters aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ships. To each of the six thousand mighty ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been assigned two hundred of the physicians. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had barely finished what preparations they had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make before the men began to arrive aboard each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ships in a steady stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything moved with automatic smoothness. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no hesitation, no needless delay. Each man knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had to do, each man did what was required</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On entering the ships, the men. five hundred or so at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time, were led into a huge chamber in the very heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ships and ordered to strip. Every member of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rank and file had on his otherwise physically per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect body ten or more pounds of excess fat. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">then ordered to pack their clothes in their kit bags</seg><seg type="columnLine">and toss them in certain large bins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as the physicians examined them--the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were inoculated with an antitoxin against the disease</seg><seg type="columnLine">germs that the men in the plague ship had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with them from the ringed world--they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed to certain rays and led through a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks containing various solutions. They were then</seg><seg type="columnLine">marched through cleansing showers, after which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dried themselves before screens throwing off radiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat, and, as they moved along by the press of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, they were dusted with a fine powder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet, cloying fragrance which was strongly anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">septic. Naked as the day they were born they followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other in a steady stream into a much larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber filled from floor to ceiling with deep coffin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like bunks, row after row until they seemed almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless, and ordered to lie down in them. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk contained a bedding of blankets spun from long</seg><seg type="columnLine">asbestos fibre, also a lid of glass-like substance which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bend but would not break.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As they crawled into the bunks they cried their fare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wells to each other. They shifted around until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a comfortable position and then grew still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their thoughts claimed all of their attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Physicians passed along the rows of bunks and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected the drugs which caused instant suspension of</seg><seg type="columnLine">animation. The effect of those drugs would not wear</seg><seg type="columnLine">off until a certain antidote was injected. The men</seg><seg type="columnLine">would need neither food nor oxygen. They could lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the death-like state of suspended animation for</seg><seg type="columnLine">many years without any ill effects except for the grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ual diminution of their weight. The lids were then</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped down and fastened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before they had finished their task the officers be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to arrive, and went about their duties at once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">paying little attention to the physicians who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">working on the last batch. The officers knew all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preparations for the "long sleep" (suspended ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation) and how to awaken the sleepers. Even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had wanted to they could not watch. Time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The officers, on entering their proper stations, made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sure that the levers controlling the motors and pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pelling rays were working smoothly, made themselves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly familiar with their posts. There was no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">need for them to explore the ship which was to be their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prison for the next thirteen and a half years, they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were familiar with every detail. They held themselves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in readiness, waiting for the signal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The same thing was going on in the south where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women were also getting ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The physicians had just left, were hurrying to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground depots as fast as they could. The time</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheduled for the departure was near. To be out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open when the ships started to leave would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  According to the schedule it lacked but a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes to the starting time. The doors were snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut. The act of closing the triple doors automatically</seg><seg type="columnLine">started the pumps to empty the air between each set</seg><seg type="columnLine">of three doors. It did not take long to form the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary vacuum. When the ships that were to go first</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done so, they signalled that they were ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was four minutes after one A. M. of the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of the year 12,001 of the New Era, four minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">late, that the first mighty interstellar ship slowly began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rear up until its sharp nose pointed up at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle of forty-five degrees, then it rose heavenwards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was propelled by the invisible rays of the fifty-fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">octave. It was the ship that carried the Leader of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Male Quota. Following fast behind it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten more of the huge interstellar ships. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South, Commander Matilda's ship flashed up into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens toward bright Sirius.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In two streams, one from the north and one from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south, the interstellar ships started on their long</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey into the utter void of that airless space be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the sun and Sirius. Every minute twenty ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the surface of Earth. It took nearly two hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the White Quota alone left the polar regions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Yellow Quota, waiting an hour, started next. Fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the heels of the Yellow Quota came those from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black Zone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The propelling power of the invisible rays of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty-fifth octave swept them along at two-thirds the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of light. The six slightly larger ships which</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried the leaders of each zone were also equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fifty-sixth octave and were able to travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a few miles of the speed of light itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On and on they sped. From far off the Second Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Expedition like the split tail of a comet cleaved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">void of space at two-thirds the speed of light. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">quota of men and women kept to themselves in long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivering lines. There was no attempt for one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingle with the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Five years passed. The sun had long ago dwindled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the brightness of an ordinary pin-point of light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was far inferior in brightness to Sirius toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were speeding. Five long, uneventful years</seg><seg type="columnLine">have slowly crawled by since they left the limits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar system behind. The officers oil all ships had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to celebrate the day. There was, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither day, nor night, nor year out there, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">governed themselves according to their chronometers</seg><seg type="columnLine">which kept Earth-time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Another year passed. They were in direct radio com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication with each other. Nothing broke the dread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful monotony of the seemingly endless journey. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanying will that the inhabitants of Earth had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent out to spur them on was beginning to make it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self felt as their own enthusiasm lagged. They needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to spur them on. Out there in the depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space between stars there was nothing, absolutely noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND SWARM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">281</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Not even a lonely comet flashed by. The rank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">file of the expedition were still sunk in a death-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">coma, and for them, naturally, time did not exist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Yellow Quota of men who had started in sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond place began to gain on the leaders. The officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the White Quota, sensing a means to break the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible monotony, a race, increased the speed of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships to the utmost limit. Still the Yellow legions con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued to draw near. Little by little they crept up</seg><seg type="columnLine">until at length the lines of the two quotas flashed along</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by side. The Yellow Quota held that position</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a while and then began to draw ahead slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">but surely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Commander Keelen flashed the news of his achieve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to Ureena, Commander of the Yellow Female</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces, and told her to try and do likewise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Black Quota chaffed the Whites unmercifully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They likened them to snails, snails speeding along at</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly two-thirds the speed of light!

Far in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main body of the Yellow forces hurtled the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar ship that carried Commander Keelen.

The officers, who had been everywhere but</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their proper places, hurried to their stations. Tele-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Commander Ureena and her quota began to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead.

The telescopes, which had been used al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most continuously at first, were rarely used now. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been suicidal for the Second Great Expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to have to depend upon men peering through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescopes to disclose objects that lay in their path</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the terrific velocity they were traveling. The ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">were one and all equipped with electrical instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">to warn the expedition of danger far ahead, the six</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scopes were trained ahead. Nothing could be seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The instruments continued to sound their warnings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger each instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sent warning back to the rest of the expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">and commanded them to come to a full stop as quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they could.

They were almost at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit of vision. Momentarily they grew brighter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer. They began to take on form. The pin-points of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light were all revolving rapidly around a common</seg><seg type="columnLine">center. The instruments that they trained upon them</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that each pin point of light was of disk-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">282</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">formation and measurable. Calculations gave them a</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter that ranged from four to eight miles. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had probably come from the direction of Sirius and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were traveling in the general direction of the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had the information flashed back to the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expedition that directly in front of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of spheres, each from four to eight miles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter. He gave the order to the ten ships to fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low him more closely. It was a dangerous thing to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The spheres were approaching at a terrific speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spheres were whirling swiftly around each other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In their forward flight through the void of the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar space they were describing a cork-screw path.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They presented a solid, impassable front. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the spheres, which was a little ahead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, paused in its whirling forward motion. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres behind gradually slackened their speed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a stop. They seemed to become aware of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleven ships in front of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the first sign that those in Commander</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keelen's ship had that the spheres contained intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent, reasoning beings; that the spheres themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">were interstellar ships. During the next few hours it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was verified in the most terrible manner. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first ball that had paused there broke forth a flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurid flame, like flaming gas under pressure issuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mouth of a great cannon, it was followed im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately by another and then another. Nothing hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. Fifteen or more minutes later one of the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">interstellar ships that accompanied Commander Keelen's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship in front of the expedition, crumpled up as if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had met something in headlong collision, became par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tially incandescent and exploded. An instant later an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ship met the same fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Without a sound the two ships had exploded. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolts that had come from the sphere in the lead, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster weapons within the sphere, did their work</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently. Sound must have a medium to transmit its</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves, it cannot cross a vacuum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The remaining nine ships in front stopped dead on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the destruction of the two. For an instant Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander Keelen and the officers were numbed into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of immobility by the sudden disaster that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">befallen them. In each of the two ships that had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to instant destruction there had been ten thous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and human beings!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spheres surrounded them on all sides and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming slowly closer. It could now be seen that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of those spheres were covered with bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots like windows and the light was streaming through</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the brightly lighted interior. They pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented a formidable appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Were the brave legions from Earth to meet their</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom in the infinite void of space far from the ringed</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet that circled bright Sirius and its faint com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion?

Had the inhabitants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ringed world that circled Sirius known of man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming and sent these death-dealing spheres out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet him? Had they in turn scouts spying upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants of Earth?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lurid sheets of flame with their accompanying bolts</seg><seg type="columnLine">again came from the sphere. There was another in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terval of about a quarter of an hour in which nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, nothing was to be seen, no warning came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the electrical apparatus which was to warn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers of an approaching body. The moments dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">by and then a bolt struck the ship which was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind and to the right of Commander Keelen's. An-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">other bolt met in headlong collision with the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar ship that was to the left of him. Only seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained in the front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came back to life with a start, the numbness</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping from them as death stared them in the face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They manned their own terrible instruments of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction. The forward end of each ship which came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a point split into a number of segments and drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the interior of the ship. Out in front there</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained an egg-shaped object of transparent sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance resembling quartz glass. It was supported by</seg><seg type="columnLine">three thick rods of the same substance. The rods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">egg-shaped object in front of each ship began to glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a pale-yellow color. It could be seen issuing for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few feet at the forward end like liquid. It traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">much slower than light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The propelling rays of the fifty-fifth octave were</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on full. The interstellar ship started to plunge</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. Four circular holes appeared some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">back from the glowing egg-shaped object at the tip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ship. A puff of white vapor and red flame sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly leapt out of each of the openings. The mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">interstellar ships rocked back to the shock. The puffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of white vapor and red flames appeared at the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings of each ship again and again, swifter and swifter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they were pouring forth continuously. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the driving rays were on full, the ships quivered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood still. At last the remaining seven of the eleven</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships that had gone forward to investigate were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">into action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pale-yellow glow which emanated from Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander Keelen's ship far in front of the other six</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the sphere in the lead, from which had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bolts that had destroyed the four ships of the Yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low Quota. It touched it lightly, seemed to caress it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not like a beam of light, but a corpuscle stream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It spread over the sphere, like molten gold, until it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enveloped it. The sphere seemed to vibrate, became in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct, was gone--destroyed. The glow reached over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and touched another sphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beings in the globular ships of space seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize the menace of those pale-yellow beams.

The de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structive power of that pale-yellow glow was startling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Desperately, and in a solid sheet, the lurid flame and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accompanying bolts shot from the nearer spheres.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The glow from the other six ships seemed to touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hazy golden fingers and then to caress six other</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres.

Glowing incandescent spots began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit the surface of a few of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flashes of the lurid light with its accompany-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bolts from the spheres were increasing steadily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One and then another of the interstellar ships from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth met the bolts in headlong collision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Globular ship of space after globular ship of space</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded from sight as the pale-yellow glow spread over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. A number of the nearer spheres became so</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with incandescent spots that they became mol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten masses of metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only five out of the original eleven interstellar ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the front remained. Though they brought down</seg><seg type="columnLine">three and more to every one of their own, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going down to certain destruction. There were too</seg><seg type="columnLine">many spheres to cope with. The bolts, hurtling all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around them, picked them off one by one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now only two remained. One, as if by a miracle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the mighty ship that carried Commander Keelen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His ship was causing the greatest havoc amongst</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND SWARM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">283</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the spheres. Something went wrong with the pale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow glow, the egg-shaped object of quartz-like glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shattered by a flying fragment of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interstellar ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Realizing that he was about doomed, he had word</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent back that he was going to try to destroy yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">one more of the globular ships of space with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own mighty interstellar ship. He did not think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning tail. If he had any thought of retreating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was too late now, the bolts would pick him off</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he turned. He had only a few minutes to live.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sent his last farewells winging back to Earth, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expedition, to the Yellow Quota, and to the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he loved more than life itself, telling them all</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry on and not let this first setback dishearten</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He, for one. was going to show those creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">how man could die. The puffs of white vapor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">red flame which were being expelled from his four</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge cannon ceased, the openings closed. Swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ship gained headway. Each instant it doubled its</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The intelligent creatures who manned the spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw what Commander Keelen was about to attempt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They knew what would happen if his ship, traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">now at a large fraction of the speed of light, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit one of their globular ships of space. The lurid</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames with their accompanying bolts came from each</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere in a terrible stream. The other interstellar</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was hit and destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Commander Keelen's mighty ship struck a globular</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship of space. There was a brilliant flare of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and both ships went up in a blinding, white-hot mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flaming gas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The news of Commander Keelen's destruction reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first of the expedition. The Yellow Quota, grit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting their teeth, started forward. They were heading</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight for the spheres to avenge him. They wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be caught by surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later word reached Commander Ureena that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the co-commander of the Yellow forces with eleven</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships had been destroyed, had gone down bravely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. As soon as she received the message she</seg><seg type="columnLine">slackened speed and swerved from the course she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was following, and headed in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres. She, too, was going to avenge the death of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her betrothed and the thousands sunk in the state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended animation who would never know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck them. Behind her streamed a thousand ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her own quota.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spheres continued in their course. The beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside of the spheres must have reasoned that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed all of those long, slender ships that had sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly appeared in front of them. Those long vehicles</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had encountered voyaging across the utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">void of space were terrible foes. They had weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unlimited destructive power, the pale-yellow glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">in particular. Thirty-eight of their own great ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been destroyed, over three to every one they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquered. While it lasted the attack had been fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful. They must have been glad that there were only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The largo doors In the sides of the ships opened and men equipped with individual flying wings strapped upon their backs, stepped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ships and flew down. . . . The surface of that world was covered with the bodies of the intelligent creatures, who had inhabited it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They looked like giant hairy tarantulas, over a hundred timcslarger than the largest tarantula that ever existed on Earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">284</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a few. If they had not struck first their loss would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been much greater. They did not know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay ahead of them, nor of the Yellow forces with Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander Ureena at the head bent upon vengeance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spheres again stopped their whirling forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion. They had hardly got under way after their</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific encounter with the eleven who had gone for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to investigate, when in front of them appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">a solid mass of those long, slender ships of space. Well</seg><seg type="columnLine">did they pause. They had met with only eleven out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and destroyed them, but in destroying them they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lost thirty-eight of their own colossal ships. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now in front of them appeared thousands, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something in the way of their coming that</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed murderous hostility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The creatures who operated those spheres must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoned that retreat was the better part of valor. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had only been a few in front of them--well, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been different. They turned and headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at right angles, the direction from which Commander</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ureena with her Yellow Quota would soon appear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men of the Yellow legions were after them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with swiftly increasing speed. The rest of the expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition were also speeding up from their immense dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tances to lend their aid. Those globular ships of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space would certainly rue the day they had met with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Second Great Expedition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again did the globular ships of space pause. Were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole heavens filled with those long, slender ships?</seg><seg type="columnLine">In front of them appeared the forces of the Yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quota, at one side, hardly visible, came the ships of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Female Quota; while the Black legions, out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight, followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They could not go forward, and at their back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed in solid formation, came the ships carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men. Again they made a quarter of a turn, back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the general direction of Sirius. From a full stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">they picked up their speed in an amazing fashion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their speed was great, but not as great as the speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the long, slender ships of the Second Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Expedition could attain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Commander Ureena and her legions, who now led</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the others in nearness to the spheres, were slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtaking them. Those in command of the spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized it. About one hundred of the globular ship3</seg><seg type="columnLine">of space fell back behind the others and came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradual stop to hold back the vengeful hosts of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a while. From each of the spheres the lurid</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame with its accompanying bolts flashed from them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a death-dealing stream. The space in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pursuing Yellow Quota was being strewn with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those ship destroying missiles. Ship after ship crumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, became partially incandescent and exploded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the long, slender interstellar ships of the Yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low Quota at their heels the pale-yellow glow from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the egg-shaped thing in front of each ship began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make its appearance. They began to touch sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">after sphere and enveloped them with their golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow--and then they were gone. The fleet did slacken</seg><seg type="columnLine">its speed, though all around them ship after ship met</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolts in headlong collision and were destroyed. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the hundred globular ships of space that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought to bar the avenging hosts of man annihilated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With renewed speed the earth's ships were after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The women officers of the Yellow Quota were mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to destroy. They held that death was far too good</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the creatures who were directly responsible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the death of Commander Keelen and the others in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the' first eleven ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two-thirds of the remaining spheres slackened their</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed in their headlong retreat to try to hold back the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ships from Earth. The globular ships of space drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from each other and formed a mighty barrier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they began to blaze away with every weapon they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had. They were fighting desperately now, even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered rats will fight valiantly against overwhelm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing odds. The speed in which the hundred spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been despatched showed all too plainly what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in store for them. Yet they appeared willing to sacri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fice themselves so that a few might escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Man was not having it all his own way. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pale-yellow glow destroyed sphere after sphere and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cannon riddled ship after ship, their long slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">interstellar ships met the bolts and were destroyed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hundreds. In the eagerness that the women of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yellow Quota were to get at them they were even</seg><seg type="columnLine">colliding with each other. That region was swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming a whirling mass of flying metal of ihstroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships. One by one the spheres met their doom. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of spheres held up the Second Great Expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After wiping out all those who had sought to bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way, the expedition looked around to reek their</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance upon the rest, but there was no sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Even their delicate instrument could not de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tect them. They had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ships of each zone resumed some semblance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">order. The Yellow forces, being in the forefront, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit the hardest. Rolls were called. Commander Ureena's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship did not answer. Her ship had been struck early.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two hundred and forty-one ships carrying two mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion, four hundred and ten thousand human beings had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After two temporary leaders were chosen to lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yellow forces, the Second Great Expedition resumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way toward the ringed world that circled bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirius and its fainter companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time passed swiftly. The members of the expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition were wiser now. The belief in the emptiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of space was discarded. An intense vigilance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being kept. They would not be caught napping a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second time, nor would they foolishly approach any</seg><seg type="columnLine">body traveling through space. At a safe distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could use their pale-yellow glow of destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remove it from their path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sirius now lit up the void of space with its white</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow. The small, dense companion of Sirius stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">out faintly when shielded from its white rays. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the larger planets would soon be made out also.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two more months and their long, hazardous journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be at an end. The more dangerous task of</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing upon that ringed world and subduing its in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitants was yet before them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In front of the expedition without the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning there suddenly flashed a score or so of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globular ships of space. They were very small, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than one hundred feet in diameter, and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely swift. Two of their number turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed for Sirius, the rest kept on the course they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been traveling before they flashed across the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the expedition. Twenty ships gave chase, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny spheres outdistanced them easily. More and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tiny spheres appeared. They made no move</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attack. They were watching the expedition as it ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached. Speed was their only defense. They out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distanced the pale-yellow glow. Some were cornered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and destroyed, the rest sped back to their world to</seg><seg type="columnLine">warn them of the immense force that was approaching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scouts were thrown out far ahead of the expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. The ships came closer together. They were ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for anything. Nothing happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another month passed. A jumbled, indistinct warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was received by man to halt. A ship, one of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND SWARM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">285</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scouts, came hurtling back, fast upon the heels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the message it had sent, to warn the expedition that</seg><seg type="columnLine">many thousands of those huge globular ships that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had met and defeated out in the void between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system and Sirius were heading straight for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition. Their number was legion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The expedition came to a gradual stop. They spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">out far and wide. The forefront of each ship opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the egg-shaped object from which the pale-yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow emanated stood forth. The four circular holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther back in each ship were also in evidence. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get a royal welcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the scouts still far in the front of the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">force came word that the globular ships of space were</seg><seg type="columnLine">attended by millions of tiny spheres. The scouts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreating in front of them as fast as they could.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No lurid (lame with its accompanying bolt had yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shot from the spheres.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A day--twenty-four hours--passed. The defenders</seg><seg type="columnLine">were drawing near to where the Second Great Expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition lay motionless in space. They were coming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give battle. In the great telescopes aboard each long</seg><seg type="columnLine">interstellar ship of the expedition they could just be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out. Their speed was slackening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were almost within the utmost limit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of the pale-yellow glow when, at the very last</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, they stopped, turned and fled back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction from which they had come. Not one of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">missiles was shot at the expedition that lay awaiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">them motionless in space. The original intention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those in the spheres had probably been to hold off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invading forces from Earth and do battle with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">far from their own world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The six commanders, thinking that it was some kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a trap, ordered the ships to move cautiously for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. With their weapons they were confident to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cope with any surprise they might encounter. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouts were thrown ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Countless hours passed. The officers stuck to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">posts. Fatigue was forgotten. Time was forgotten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The discomforts of the body were forgotten. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringed planet could be made out at last. Those at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye-pieces of the telescopes saw thousands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge globular ships of space separate themselves from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring of moonlets that circled that world and leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">its neighborhood, going in the opposite direction from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the expedition were approaching. They seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be abandoning their world. They preferred retreat</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than to stay and face the Second Great Expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition. The survivors of those they had met out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the void of space must have returned with terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">tales. A lesson in warfare had been taught to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they could not forget.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The expedition made no move to follow the spheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were leaving the vicinity of Sirius. The ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the expedition came closer and closer, searching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of that world for any suspicious sign. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">their powerful telescopes they scrutinized the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that world most minutely. When satisfied that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be no trap, half of the officers of each ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into the large chambers where the rank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">file of the expedition lay in the state of suspended</seg><seg type="columnLine">animation and began to inject the antidote to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drugs which had caused the condition that so closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembled death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people who had lain down healthy and over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight were now as gaunt as skeletons. They could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not rise from their bunks, or even lift their arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For days they had to be fed and cared for before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could move weakly about. The interstellar ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meanwhile, hung poised some distance from the planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some regained their strength faster than others and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to help the officers. Many had a relapse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and died, their systems unable to stand the antidote,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was a very powerful drug. Those who re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered grew stronger and at last completely re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thousands of interstellar ships from Earth drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer to the ringed world. Just outside of the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere they circled it. Very slowly they entered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere. From any spot on the surface of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">world the inhabitants could see one or two inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar ships sinking toward them. They were doomed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Telescopes pointing downward showed the creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that world moving about feverishly. The interstellar</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships sank still lower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At various points of that world thousands of tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships of air rose and started firing their weapons at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ships from Earth, The great guns at the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of each interstellar ship destroyed them. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and they in turn were destroyed. Guns roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">from below. Bombs were dropped, wiping out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns. At last silence reigned. No more tiny ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose, no more guns roared at the invadei-3. All activity</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cities ceased. For forty-eight hours the Second</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Expedition hung menacing above the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ringed world, waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The interstellar ships dropped down until they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only two miles above the surface. The large doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sides of the ships opened and men equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with individual flying wings strapped upon their backs</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out of the ships and flew down. In a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">strap around their waists they carried a score of tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">but extremely powerful bombs. They were the rank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and file of the expedition and fluttered down like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plague of locusts, destroying everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When satisfied that no living thing remained upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">that world, they began to explore the wrecked cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the former owners. Every one was eager to stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs upon solid ground once again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surface of that world was covered with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies of the intelligent creatures, who had inhabited</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. On Earth there were creatures who resembled them</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little. The inhabitants looked like giant hairy taran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tulas, over a hundred times larger than the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarantula that ever existed on Earth. There was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">one living spider-like creature to be found, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were countless millions of them in various stages</seg><seg type="columnLine">of putrefaction strewn along the thoroughfares of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their queer cities. Millions of them it was found had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed themselves long before the rank and file started</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping their bombs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Realizing his mistake too late, man searched in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">nook and cranny of that world in the hope of finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them alive. Their civilization was great and</seg><seg type="columnLine">much could have been learned from them. They found</seg><seg type="columnLine">books composed of thin metal plates covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange script. Men and women were set to the task</seg><seg type="columnLine">of deciphering them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the men and women were clearing those</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange cities away and plowing under the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that world, probably the first time its surface ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the plow, and getting ready to plant the seeds</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they had brought with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men and women who were set to work to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipher the books found the key.

He led the group</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the ramp into the Palm Garden where he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the dramatic story of the past week on the isle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port; of Holden's wound; of the death of the spy;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of the final defeat of the European Alliance. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">internationally famed reporter for the Associated Press</seg><seg type="columnLine">requested and obtained access to the wireless room</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which the story was sent to the waiting press</seg><seg type="columnLine">of America and the World.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An army surgeon and nurses had come with one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planes and immediately upon his arrival was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducted to the bedside of the wounded man. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful examination, he warmly commended Miss Crom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well and Jerry Scott for their work. The wound had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been thoroughly disinfected and showed every indica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of healing. But the fever; that was due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock and exposure, and all they could do would be to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assist fiature. To this end. he devoted all his attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">and skill, but he foresaw that it would take many days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly weeks before the fever could be thrown off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meantime the patient must have absolute quiet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful nursing. He wanted to send for another nurse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assist in the work, but Kitty Cromwell would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear of it, and the surgeon who had acquired much</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom beyond that which he had learned from books,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielded to her. Bulletins were sent out daily concern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Holden's condition, and in the busy marts of trade</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the homes of a thankful people, they were awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hope and scanned with thanksgiving, that at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no change for the worse. And day by day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fever was expending itself and the hopes for recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery grew stronger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late on the day following the arrival of the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes, a fleet of fast cruisers arrived off the isleport.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A boat was lowered and conveyed a Rear Admiral to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the structure where he was received by Jerry Scott on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower deck. The fleet had already picked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story sent from the isleport and the Admiral came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay his respects to Holden through his companions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to offer them any service that might be within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the Government to bestow. A conference was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">held in the Palm Garden at which it was decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send to the isleport a Guard of Marines together with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless operators, mechanicians, a chef and assistants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The medical force was augmented by two more Naval</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surgeons. In the morning the fleet would return, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one battle cruiser to cruise around in the vicinity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the isleport. Two airplanes were also to remain with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the disposition of forces completed, the Ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miral, surgeons and others remained in quiet con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse in the Garden until long after night had fallen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry Scott was asked concerning many details of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle, all of which he answered in a manner that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected the credit for the entire defense upon his friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Miss Cromwell. But he firmly refused all sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestions to show his visitors the apparatus that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought the destruction. That, he said, was a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">solely for Bob Holden to decide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The days passed slowly and stretched themselves into</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks. On the isleport, matters had settled into a daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">routine as they waited for the fever to wear itself out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio messeges expressing wishes for Holden's recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery were received by the thousand from public of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficials all over the World. The Trans-Atlantic Airplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Service, Inc., asked Jerry Scott to take full charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their interests on the isleport during Holden's illness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he soon found himself flooded with a multitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">details that made the time pass more rapidly. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never remained away from Holden's bedside for very</seg><seg type="columnLine">long intervals, especially after the crisis had passed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend was able to listen to him as he talked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OCTOBER had come and over Atlantis lay the peace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful haze of Indian Summer. The fever that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">for so long held sway in Holden's body and brain, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally spent itself but it had taken fearful toll of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">once athletic figure. The will to live, the intensity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his desire, and the incessant care of Kitty Cromwell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aided by the united skill of his physicians, had at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumphed. Then had come days of recuperation, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">day adding visibly to his strength. Finally came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">A MODERN ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">287</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">day when he asked to be wheeled out into the Palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garden. There was an understanding light in the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of both Holden and his nurse, as they talked together</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the waving branches, and the sunlight made</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving delicate patterns of the palm leaves which</seg><seg type="columnLine">chased each other across the steamer robe that pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected him from the bracing October air. The fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers flaunted their gaudy colors on every grassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. It was the season when life finds its deepest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiest significance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry Scott wandered about the isleport. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not blind himself to the love that had come to crown</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lives of his two best friends and the knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it meant to both of them would forever seal</seg><seg type="columnLine">within him the vision of a hope which had twice been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered. His walk finally brought him to where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sitting and, in response to a call from Kitty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cromwell, he joined them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jerry," said Bob, "I have always wanted to ask you</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you and Kitty had known each other before that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day when you met in the circular room."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerry looked at Kitty Cromwell who nodded her as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent, then he said. "You remember one winter's night</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1922, at the Harvard Club when I read from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper about Jack Rutherford."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kitty Cromwell flinched as if she had been struck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned pale and looked furtively from one to the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," said Holden slowly, as he raised himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair, "what you are trying to tell me is that Kitty</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Jack's wife."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not is, but was.

I know that Jack didn't do it. It was war that</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused and they saw how deeply he was moved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But soon he looked up at them and smiled as he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Bob took a pledge that night although he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen you, Kitty.

He produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small book from his pocket and opened it; "In honor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this woman who has given so much, I pledge myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whatever I can do, to the abolition of war." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">we all drank a toast that night, "To The Abolition Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">War."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He arose and taking a hand of each in his, own</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed them together as he said: "Bob has fulfilled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pledge."
