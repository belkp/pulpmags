            <seg type="columnLine">knew that women admired him. He had felt it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in their eyes for the last six years.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">AND then Roy stopped thinking. His eyes fell</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on Kathleen Burke who was the most beautiful</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">creature he had ever seen in his whole life. Kath-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leen was merely a single figure in a pool full of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stenographers but she stood out. She dominated</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the offices. She was that comparative rarity, a really</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">exquisite red haired woman.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> As he stood there he did not analyze her in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">detail. He saw the firm hills jutting out under the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slick black silk of her dress. He saw the split skirt</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that went up above her knees and showed the round-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ness of them and a band of creamy flesh beyond</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the stocking top. He saw her lean over her type-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">writer and what that pose did to her satiny ron-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dures, how the black satin gaped and a dark valley</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sprang into view. He saw all these things but only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as a total effect that was good and exciting and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beautiful.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He turned back into his office, shut the door,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sat behind the desk and sent for Kathleen Burke.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">His heart was pounding as he waited for her. His</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knees fe't weak under his desk and his hands were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fidgeting nervously.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> When she came through the door</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and stood there Monda's kindness</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and her generosity beat against him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for a moment. This was his first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unfaithful moment to Monda. And</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">habit is a strong thing.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> But when Kathleen Burke came</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">across the room, swinging her silky</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hips and her full graceful breasts</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moving up and down with her step,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Roy forgot Monda. He forgot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">everything but the hunger in his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heart and the vital thing his man's life had missed.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He smiled up at the girl who had taken a chair</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at his side. He said, "When you were designed,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the gods must have been in an inspired mood, Miss</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Burke."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> And his eyes went over her then, more closely,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in detail now. He saw the high pointed peaks of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her firm bosom pressing against the black silk. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw the tinge of rose color under the creamy band</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of flesh above her stocking. He saw the red tip</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of her tongue just beyond the barrier of her teeth</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">--and his heart began to pump, his temples throb-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bed and his breath went short in his chest. Kathleen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Burke was a beauty, a rare, gorgeous, exciting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beauty.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> She said, "Thank you, Mr. Barton." And her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eyes met his, squarely. His heart leapt again. She</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knew why he had sent for her. She knew that Roy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Barton never required the services of the girls from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the pool when he had a dynamic, efficie.it secretary</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his own who allotted the work to them all.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">BUT despite his pumping heart there was some-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing in the girl's eyes he didn't like. A dollar</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mark look, perhaps; a look of mink coats and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">jewelled baubles and a sleek town car. Well, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could afford those things now. Other men did.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">And his gaze moved down from her eyes to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">body of the girl. What he saw was intoxicating and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">because he was trembling violently and because this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">business was so new to him, he began to dictate.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Out of the tail of his eye he saw her fingers busy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with the zipper at her bodice. He heard a little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">b-z-z-z-z but he did not look up. He wouldn't</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spoil things by rushing her. Even though he knew</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now, instinctively that the girl had had her green</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eyes on him for a long while. He went on dictat-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing. He paid no attention to the light touch of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her knee against his. He pretended not to see the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">swollen white mounds of her bosom when she bent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">across his desk to get letterheads and check the ad-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dresses on the correspondence. He sat rigid, wait-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing for time, for nerve -- for her to make the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He didn't wait long after that. In the middle of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a letter the girl spoke. Her voice was very soft,</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">throbbingly young and vital. She said, "Mr.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I've been here a year--and this is the first time</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">knee half expecting her to move that dimpled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">softness away. But she didn't. She only sat look-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," she said, finally. "I know. And I'm--</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He said, "Will you have dinner with me to-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Kathleen Burke said, "I'd love to go to dinner</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">his given name Roy's heart leapt and his veins</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flamed. He got up, quickly, caught the girl by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her hands and drew her to her small sandaled feet.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">listened with almost unbelieving ears when he said,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Monda--the great man wanted to paint Monda.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The idea aroused so many conflicting considerations</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that his reply, when it came, was a stammer. "Why,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I'd be honored, I'm sure!" It was an honor. Any</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> But it wasn't the money. It seemed that the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Eric smiled indulgently, "Because she is the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">most paintable woman I've ever seen. Her lines</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">are incomparable. Her face is exquisite. She is,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in a word, ravishing. But didn't you know? Or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have you been with her so long, so close, you've</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">failed to even see her? That happens with hus-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">wider. "At least," he added, "with some husbands.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Busy American husbands."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Roy was stunned. Secretly he thought Monda</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was looking very tired these days, a little peaked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about the mouth, certainly anything but ravishing.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He thought that if Eric could see Kathleen's color-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> And at that moment Kathleen entered with a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">She came swinging her silky hips, her red head</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">high and her voluptuous breasts bouncing right and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">left with their unbrassiered freedom. She winked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a green eye at Roy, laid yesterday's unfinished</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">faced Eric she smiled up into his eyes, arched her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bosom a little as if calling attention to its pouting</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Roy thought. "He's seen her. That'll end</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Eric only shook his head. "The world is full of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> "It's okay by me," said Roy, indifferently. But</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he didn't feel indifferent. He felt the first pride</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"Monda will be flattered silly," he said. "Go to it.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> When Borgstrom left Roy did not ring for</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> And then, out of nowhere, something struck</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Was the portrait just a blind?</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He remembered the way Eric had been looking</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at Monda at the piano and Monda's indifference</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to whether he had come home at eleven or not at</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">all. He felt exceedingly uncomfortable. And he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knew all at once he didn't want to lose Monda. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">didn't love her, of course. He had married her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for her money. It wasn't exactly the loss of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Monda that was angering him--and he didn't</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">know just why he was feeling so hot under the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">collar and so icy down tne spine.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Kathleen came in then, without knocking. She</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was beginning to assert her privileges. Her power</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> She said, "Hello, darling! Glad to see me?"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He wasn't but he said, "Yes. Certainly."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> And when she caught his hand and led him into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the study, when she closed the door behind them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and curled her soft arms about his neck, Roy was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sorry that he had started anything at all with this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">girl. Yesterday it had seemed the only thing to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">do! Wasn't he hungry for love--for a woman's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">kisses? Wasn't he still hungry?</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> He looked down into Kathleen's slim face and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought of Eric's words--"The world is full of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that kind." And suddenly, Roy knew it was true.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Knew that he didn't want Kathleen or anyone like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her. Knew with a queer sick feeling inside that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had loved Monda, almost from the very begin-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ning and that he loved her now with an acuteness</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that made him a little dizzy.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "Kiss me, darling--kiss me," purred Kathleen.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Automatically Roy's mouth dropped</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the red splash of lips. He clung to them.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">His hands went over her soft white flesh, slipped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through the vent of an armhole, swept over the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">warm surface of a slim back. He felt the girl</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tremble against him, felt her drawing him to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sofa. But even as he followed and sat with her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the low green couch and took her into his arms,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he was not thinking of Kathleen Burke. He was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thinking of Monda.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, as these thoughts revolved in his mind,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he began to feel that he, who had had everything</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from Monda, had given her little or nothing in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">return. When she had probably expected the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">emotion he had given to this little redhead yester-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">day he had let her down. He knew all at once</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">how sublimely generous and how unselfish she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was. And, more startling than everything, how</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Kathleen Burke pushed back in his arms. "What</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Roy looked at the girl. The white silk of her</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of high peaks showing plainly. She was twisted</seg>
