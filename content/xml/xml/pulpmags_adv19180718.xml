This he placed in one of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstretched hands. She opened her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, startled by the warmth of the live</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing she held.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A young mocker I found by the road-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.

He had thought of her, bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to her who was named Mocking Bird a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little mocking bird. She fully appreciated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the delicate compliment, but, though she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could speak three languages, she could think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of no fitting words to express her joy. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only give the man a full adoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance--a glance in which there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poignant pain of a woman's love. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn was blind to that glance. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still "the little brown one" to him. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothed the fledgling in her hands, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to notice how her fingers raised to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">as steel to magnet, and the sharp intake</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her breath at the seemingly accidental</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He patted her head, admonished her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take good care of the mocker, pointed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger at her, cocking the thumb as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting at her, and paused to see her smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had always been able to make her smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he whirled and strode toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the hotel, calling out a hearty</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting to Uncle Charlie, and vaulting over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side rail of the porch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Set down," invited Uncle Charlie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumbling for his tobacco. "How's things</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' on out to your place?" He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for Norn's answer, but went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly: "My niece and nephew are</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornin' in on today's stage. House all torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">up." He aimed a wicked blow at a fly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed, and sighed resignedly.

Hem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per would be a prison to a woman used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds, and light and laughter. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only endure about so much of it, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York, London or Paris, to become an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immaculately-garbed spectator of the thick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowing city life. Then weariness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">boredom, and finally a swift winging</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to his beloved mountains and</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Uncle Charlie's niece would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain with her sick brother.

Must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be an unusual woman to make such a sacri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fice. Still, he did not propose to entangle</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the destinies of Uncle Charlie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">relatives. They might come out to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch that sprawled in the lap of Rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maker, and hunt and fish, but he wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutter up his life with their troubles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE main street of Hemper quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened into life. The stage from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west was due in a few minutes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men came strolling toward the hotel, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at their watches. The arrival of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage from the west was a momentous</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair to the citizens of Hemper, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they pretended to treat the event with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lofty indifference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chance" Hardy, the cold-eyed, flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheekboned, black-haired proprietor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon and gambling-house across the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode over to the hotel porch, greeted Norn</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually, and settled himself in a wicker</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. He lighted a cigar, flicking out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">match with a supple white finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Charlie waddled into the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and secured a huge telescope.

Breathing heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily, he returned to the porch. Running a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel was strenuous work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Pat, the stage-driver, usually at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted a flourish as he came into Hemper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He cracked the long whip, and halted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming leaders on a line exactly even</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the porch, giving himself the indiffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent air of a conquering hero. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">king of the reins, and not for gold or</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious jewels would he do anything but</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive the four. The removal of baggage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mail was the work of menials, and he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not demean himself by lifting a pound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The stage door opened and a large, fleshy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-dressed man, with a round, dimpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin, stepped down gingerly, fearful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting dust on his shining shoes. He gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loungers on the porch a cursory glance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed his way past Uncle Charlie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Driver, what have you done with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pat looked down at the big, soft face, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawled insultingly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I got something else to do besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinkin' about your baggage.

The arrival of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stage meant nothing to him, for he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast stock of memories of cities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange places from which to draw comfort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, a thin boy in knickerbockers</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended from the stage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dickie!" yelled Uncle Charlie, seizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lad and lifting him from the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm your uncle, boy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie smiled politely. The old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave his nephew a hearty smack, and gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed him toward the'porch. The boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Norn seated on the floor, and smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly as the man gave him a friendly glance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor youngster,thought the rancher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"he has arrived just in time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Charlie thought at first he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of sun-stroke.

Then pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood surged up in the old man. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm, gracious, beautiful woman was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">niece.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uncle Charlie!" she murmured; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped her arms around the old man's neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kissed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Gone forever were Uncle Charlie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grumblings concerning the trouble that</seg><seg type="columnLine">relatives make an old man. She stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly into his heart. A rich emotion</seg><seg type="columnLine">welled up within him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Darned old fool I am, Dora. I'm so</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind I can't see you." He held her off</seg><seg type="columnLine">at arm's length. But all he could say was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, girl! Oh, girl!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fat stranger attempted to escort</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Wayne to the porch, but Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie gave him a terrible glare, and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">a proprietary arm around his niece.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Chance Hardy arose, and Norn, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking up, but knowing that a woman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, got to his feet. The other men</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped back awkwardly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Mr. Hardy," Uncle Charlie</seg><seg type="columnLine">began, proudly. "Mr. Hardy, my niece,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Dora Wayne."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy raised his dark gaze to the cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet eyes of the girl and flinched inwardly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he noted her loveliness, the utter warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">womanliness of her, his hands tightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">until his knuckles whitened. He removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat and bowed with a grace that sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised those who knew him. The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly acknowledged the pleasure of meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Mr. Hardy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NORN was the last to be presented.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He bowed, and then, as their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">met, he imagined that he* felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden stab of pain in his chest--a pang of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spirit that could hardly be distinguished</seg><seg type="columnLine">from physical pain. He strove to speak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">marveling at the fact that he, a man of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, was stricken dumb. But he gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered his forces and managed to remark--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doubtless you have had a hard trip."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as he spoke he noted the sickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">inanity of his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, no," she coolly returned. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly enjoyed it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was moving toward the office door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickie had taken her hand, and Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie was holding her arm. The fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger sprang forward to open the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each man on the porch cursed himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a blockhead. Not one of them had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said anything worth while, and not one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to open the screen door. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat stranger clung to the happy trio until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reached the stairway. Then he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the porch, and introduced himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the somber-faced Hemperites as G.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holden Brown, interested in the resources</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the country--ahem! No one made any</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment, and one by one the men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hemper departed, leaving the stranger in</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of the porch. Hardy, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the fat man a deadly ophidian stare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That fat stranger thinks well of himself,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy remarked over his shoulder, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Norn entered the saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy, Norn thought, was already at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted by the girl's beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bartender, knowing the rancher's</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits, set him out a glaBs of mineral water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy joined him, taking a cigar at his cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">invitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Says he's interested in the resources of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country," sneered Hardy. "G. Holden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown, hey! G. Holden Mush would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, concluded Norn, Hardy was inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in Uncle Charlie's niece, else why</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">should he be annoyed at the prancing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fat stranger. The Hardy way with</seg><seg type="columnLine">women was cold, utterly selfish and brutal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the extreme. A smile as cold as star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light on snow crept into Norn's eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would that violet-eyed, dark-haired, full-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown woman travel the trail of those the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler had discarded? If that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy plan, he would endeavor to block it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But why? A man was free to seek any</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. Again that pang--that curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">pang. Intuition told him that Hardy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to comment on the girl's beauty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must escape before the gambler mouthed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her name. Didn't like the idea of talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about any woman in a saloon. Yes; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it--any woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fairly flung himself from the saloon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurried to his horse. He felt a desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get into the desert silence, and classify</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brand the unruly thoughts milling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he vaulted into the saddle, he glimpsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy Snake, a Piute renegade, prowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cottonwoods near the road. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian, as the rancher dashed down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert road, stared after him with eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that flamed murderous hatred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, Billy, being of mature age, greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired a squaw, and had selected Maria for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that honor. But her parents, being Mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion Indians, looked down on the vagabond</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piute, and refused him the hospitality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their cabin back of the hotel kitchen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy had then threatened Maria's father</seg><seg type="columnLine">with various unpleasant deaths, promising</seg><seg type="columnLine">lastly to cut out the old Indian's heart and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat it raw. A furious gabbling had ensued.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Charlie, hearing the clamor, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed back, and incontinently kicked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piute into the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, then, to add to the black rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubbling thickly in his heart, Billy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen Norn give Maria the fledgling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maria had prepared a nest for the mocker</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a cigar box, resolving later to weave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little cage of willow withes for the belpved</seg><seg type="columnLine">birdling. She missed seeing Norn depart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Charlie having sent her up-stairs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin her duties as maid to his niece.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dora's beauty, the richness of her garb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the shy Indian girl feel as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been appointed handmaiden to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some divinity. Dora gently instructed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her duties which were light and simple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Milliken, a motherly soul whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Charlie has secured to take charge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dickie, arrived and proceeded to win the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Dora had excused Maria for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon, the Indian girl returned to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fledgling, and took it out to the step of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. There, with many murmured en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dearments, she wove for it a little cage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">willow withes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy Snake crouched low in the shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cottonwoods. Maria could not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from where she sat, but he could plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her at her labor of love. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of reckoning came, the gift of the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man would be destroyed. Perhaps the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man would follow the way of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gift-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy had come to town with a message</seg><seg type="columnLine">from certain desert rovers to Hardy. Tliat</seg><seg type="columnLine">message had been delivered, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been slipped his reward, a quart of whisky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would return to the desert and drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whisky. The water of fire that gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man the courage to do and to dare any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing would tell him how to destroy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man and his gift,.-and how .to secure</seg><seg type="columnLine">the squaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So thinking, he sought his pony tethered</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the cottonwoods, and sped back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The little cage grew in the deft hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maria. Ah, he had remembered her--</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought her a gift! A living bird that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would in time sing to her sweetly. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">her soul in anticipation of the bird-song,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang blithely within her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Chang in the kitchen door shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. She, an Indian girl, made too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the white man's gift. But that was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's way: like a child playing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight, all heedless of the coming of night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS NORN struck the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert, down to which the pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly sloped, he asked himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange question: was it possible for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become seriously interested in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman? Did they not all talk the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk? Knowing the love of one was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowr the love of hundreds. But a recur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rence of that curious pang wrung from him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the admission that this woman who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Dora Wayne might be different.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was a sphinx-like air about her, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumbering mystery.

Doubtless many men had des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately endeavored to rouse her interest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had traveled the world over; she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">many memories of men. She knew their</seg><seg type="columnLine">word-formulse, their strutting egotisms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What then, admitting an interest in her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would a man have to do to attract her</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention? Long he pondered that ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Perhaps, a circle of danger drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">around her would eliminate many men, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could always give any man safe conduct</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her smile.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the basin grew the semi-tropic wild palm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, in a few hours' ride, one could be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep snow amid giant pines.

He made a sort of "dough-god"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of corn-meal, and propped it up by the fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thoroughly enjoyed the meal.

Perhaps Norn, who, men said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a panther in the night, was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching him, waiting for the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostile move.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood that in time of need the gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">might kill a Norn steer, but they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">not waste the meat or sell it. This agree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment had come down to Norn from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father and the leader of the gang that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">preceded the Bundy aggregation.

After</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had struggled, suffered, dared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">died, she might say--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Away with them all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Bundy and his ilk did not recognize</seg><seg type="columnLine">her power of choice. In their thick egotism</seg><seg type="columnLine">they imagined that they had only to pursue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seeking the elusive woman they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet death face to face.

All</seg><seg type="columnLine">his furious mental scurrying to and fro was</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by a woman who was now calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping. He laughed harshly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he walked back to his horse, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">petted it, talking to it childishly. He even</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured some wisps of grass and rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dawn came with glowing bronze bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the eastern sky, and Rain-maker</seg><seg type="columnLine">shimmering in opalescent haze.

Norn mounted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trotted back to the stage road that</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted like a wounded snake across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basin. Coming to the branch road leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his ranch, he reined in, hooked a leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the saddle horn, and debated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the final decision closed his lips in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin line, and he turned and galloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Hemper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUNDY was Hardy's 'choke,, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">therein lay the true source of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bundy chieftainship. The gang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling cattle-rustler was very pliable in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of the gambler. Hardy knew that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">more positive character would not long</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring him tribute while he sat in soft ease</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy handled the money derived from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sales of stolen cattle and horses, allowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself a liberal commission. Ultimately</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulk of the money he turned over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang found its way back to his safe via bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gambling-table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, like any feudal chief, Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected his men, loaning them money and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paying their doctor bills. Men not oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ating with the gang but necessary to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy welfare came in for a share of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">largesse. Among his partisans he num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered complaisant officers of the law who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of hunting down the gang, spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of their time in Hardy's saloon, ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king no move without consulting him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy's saloon was the courtroom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert country, and, to a large extent, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler was judge and jury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But between Uncle Charlie and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler existed an agreement as to division</seg><seg type="columnLine">of territory. Uncle Charlie was to control</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel and not to be disturbed or an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noyed by the Hardy partisans. Hardy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep his men under control, and not per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit them to annoy the peaceable citizens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the community or to disturb Hemper</seg><seg type="columnLine">House guests. Uncle Charlie, though a wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in all other respects, had a pet delusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding his position in Hemper. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded himself as a sort of perennial mayor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this delusion Hardy indulged the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, consulting him on affairs of no im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance. The desert men, the gambler</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, regarded Uncle Charlie with the ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eration they might accord an old landmark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, combined with the fact that the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was no mean warrior, held the Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">policy close to the line of indulgence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At times various members of the gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">made some pretense of working in the mines</seg><seg type="columnLine">or riding on the cattle round-ups, but gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally they were swinging back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pass to the Mexican border,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily armed, superbly mounted, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">search of booty. There were other gangs</seg><seg type="columnLine">operating across the Mexican border, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cattle-rustling industry was fairly well</seg><seg type="columnLine">orgaiazecT^At times the gang would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a'little side-venture and relieve some un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wary travelers of their valuables, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully avoided stage hold-ups, and wisely</seg><seg type="columnLine">refrained from invading the thickly-settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">country west of the pass. They had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to bring a flock of San Francisco and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Los Angeles deputies down on them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy and his men racked into Hemper</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the early morning, leaving their horses in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stage stable corral, and headed straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the saloon where they expected to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy and receive some hard-earned gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy, however, was asleep in his room</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the saloon, and the gang dulled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp edge of impatience with several</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds of drinks. Billy Snake, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought them the news of the gold being at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their disposal, was handed a big drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the back window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Breakfast was next in order, and they re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved their belts and secreted their guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside their shirts. Uncle Charlie's rules</seg><seg type="columnLine">forbade armed men entering his hotel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they thus evaded any clash with the landlord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That one big drink had elevated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits of Billy Snake until he believed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to be the equal of any white man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vaguely he recalled a certain disagreeable-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness on the part of the old man who ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel, but that was a small matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was hungry, and would eat with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man he served. He joined the gang as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">clattered into the hotel office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Charlie reached back of the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">that served for a desk and secured his old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buffalo gun, an octagon-barreled Sharpe's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The great rifle called for a cartridge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might pass as the offspring of a field-piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell, a sort of brass bridegroom of death</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a paper collar around the bullet. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was hit with a bullet from that gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">need not worry about doctor bills. Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie claimed that he had killed seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apaches with one shot from the old bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower. • The Indians were in single file, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one bullet sufficed for the unlucky seven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to the bland statement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landlord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''What's that Injun doin' in here?" roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the irate old man.

"This trigger pulls easy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Indian hastily retreated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Charlie tenderly replaced his rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its sacred corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ought to have got that Injun," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself mournfully.

Bundy looked about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly, expecting to see Uncle Charlie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">relatives enter and seat themselves at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the family table. Pete grinned as he read</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bundy's thoughts. Bundy would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">make good his boast of being the first man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kiss the new girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BILLY SNAKE brooded for a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cottonwoods, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly approached the hotel kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">door.

Maria sidled back against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen table as she realized the Paiute was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming toward her. His hand reached out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clutch her. She seized a pan of dish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and flung it full in his face. Chang</seg><seg type="columnLine">then sprang into action. He dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife, seized a ladle of hot grease and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprayed it over the bewildered Indian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy beat a swift retreat, howling like a dog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chang secured more ammunition, and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to repel any attack, the while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">emitted weird, shrill Chinese expletives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gang in the dining-room heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commotion, and tipped over their chairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crowded into the kitchen.

They laughed bru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tally, and Bundy indulged in such wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirth as to acquire a severe case of hic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cups. Billy tore the last vestage of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt from his body and then dashed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">an irrigation ditch into which he plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rolled.

But, barring Pete, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the gang had forgotten the bet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Bundy was prone to make boastful</seg><seg type="columnLine">declarations which • he sometimes made</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, but more often later waved aside as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere joke. Among themselves ilfe-tagn re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to him as "Windy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy called the gang into a card-room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave them their share of the cattle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">money in good, red gold.

Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times he sought the front door to inspect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel porch. No girl in sight yet. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, and a dollar or twro on roulette.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he secured his cartridge-belt from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bartender, and performed a little dance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one paid any attention to him.

Bundy would fling down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief, whirl his horse, and race</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, leaning from the saddle to snatch up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the handkerchief. Then he would waggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, and look at the impassive girl on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the porch as though to say--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look at me; didn't I do that clever?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the girl was not interested in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding and the cowboy stunts of the flam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boyant creature with the wide mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had wearied of Buffalo Bill's Wild West</seg><seg type="columnLine">Show, with its picked riders, and she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">yawned when a Cossack officer in Moscow</seg><seg type="columnLine">had put his whole troop through its paces in</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor of her. Drunken Bundy, cheap and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sordid, with his little tricks, was of no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest to her than an organ-grinder's</seg><seg type="columnLine">muuJrtfpT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She arose and murmured to her brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they would take a little walk.

Then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">form descended on the horse's croup and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beastly face was jerked back. She caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flash of a gun, as Norn snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bundy's six-shooter from the holster and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed it aside. The girl staggered back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Dickie, realizing that the rider had at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to seize his sister, broke into shrill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boyish imprecations, and strove to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his sister's detaining grasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn's left arm was now a rope of steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Bundy's neck.

Bundy</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost the reins, .and both men were hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground. Norn was up first, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed his knee in the small of Bundy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, while he wrenched the rustler's right</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm back and up. Bundy answered with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">groan from the depths of his being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Convinced that the six- shooter had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bundy's sole weapon, Norn leaped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him.

Norn could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked him cold, but he wanted to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for punishment. So he proceeded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send in hard, heart-shaking blows to certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulnerable parts of the Bundy body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bundy followed the evasive rancher about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whining like a dog, and cursing; but Norn</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped in a terrible blow to a spot just</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the heart, and Bundy paused to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agony that followed. But he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than met that agony when the Norn</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist struck him dully in a point over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">short ribs, and more agony followed. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was repeated many times. Then Norn</seg><seg type="columnLine">began on the man's solar plexus, sending in</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow after blow until it became a quivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy Snake, glowering over his grease</seg><seg type="columnLine">burns, watched the fight with awe. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who was his master could not touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mocking-bird-giver. Billy did not like</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist-fights; they struck him as nasty work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A knife would be much quicker and cleaner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy was now whistling like a wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken horse, and Norn shifted his attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the man's face and head. He proceeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to batter the Bundy features to a pulp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully refraining from striking the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jaw. Then suddenly from the bloody</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips of the rustler, broke the thin whine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeps from the innermost core and calls for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mercy stroke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn shifted lightly to the left and swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the base of the Bundy jaw, with his full</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weight back of the blow. Bundy sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly to his knees, and then sprawled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn returned to the hotel to find Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie resting his Sharpe's against a porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillar, his old eye blazing across the sights</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a group of men in front of the saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They were goin' to interfere," the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man gritted, "but I sort of made 'em change</seg><seg type="columnLine">their minds. Did you whup him good?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn made no reply, but glanced at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl who regarded him coldly. He went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel washroom. Apparently she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no garlands to place on his manly brow for</seg><seg type="columnLine">having trounced the very life out of the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had attempted to kiss her. Well, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't blame her much. It was tiresome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disagreeable business, and she was doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgusted with the whole male population</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Hemper. But he could not have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">any different. Whether she liked it or not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bundy would no more seek to attract her</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention. He washed his face and hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and removed the soil of battle from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess Mr. Norn nearly laid that man</seg><seg type="columnLine">out," remarked Dickie. "If I'd been big</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, I would have laid him out, you bet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His sister smiled indulgently, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighed wearily. After all that man Norn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though greatly touted by her uncle, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like all the rest of them, ever seeking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show off his brute strength, ever parading</seg><seg type="columnLine">his masculinity. Still, it was a manly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiling to relieve her of the annoyance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature on the horse. She was forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to admit that Norn had made no parade</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the fight. He had merely glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She recalled the strutting Italian officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had fought a duel with a fellow-officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he imagined that by such means</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could gain her favor. The Italian had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to her after the duel, boasting of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">swordsmanship, and had been surprised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed beyond measure when she dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed him abruptly. Then there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York clubman who had trounced an</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined rival in front of her apartments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After the fight the clubman had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, expecting to be garlanded with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor. Instead, she had told him that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest favor he could show her would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remove his being from her presence for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. Therefore she gave Norn a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit-mark for not running true to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual masculine form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Charlie was replacing his rifle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner, when Norn came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">washroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sleep," said Norn laconically; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought the room Uncle Charlie always re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And she never even thanked him," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landlord marveled aloud. "What kind o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">wimmin are they raisin' these days?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The menace of Uncle Charlie's rifle re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, Pete ran out to inspect his chief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He found Bundy on all fours, making feeble</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts to gain his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete returned and reported Bundy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition to Hardy who was fairly boiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">over with rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bundy's through," rasped out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler. "Get him out of town, and look</seg><seg type="columnLine">after things yourself. Don't let me see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him or there'll be a funeral. How often</seg><seg type="columnLine">have I told the--" and here Hardy affixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain descriptions of Bundy's ancestors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and general weaknesses-- "to keep off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street and leave strangers alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Hardy's rage was not caused by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-flown desire to keep intact-th^^eace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Hemper, but by the low-browed Bundy</seg><seg type="columnLine">even daring to think of looking at the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he, Hardy, had selected for himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete hurriedly jerked the gang away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the games and the bar and drove them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the corral. There, with much grumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cursing, they saddled their horses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They rode over to Bundy who was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandering about like a sick burro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete reined in and surveyed the whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">man disgustedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Norn certainly done a good job on</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," he jeered.

Then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she realized that it hurt her strangely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see his arm about the girl, she fled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleak heights of Puritanism. Norn, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealthy cattleman, was playing with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple Indian girl.

She would rescue Maria, lift her up</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenderly from the depths. . . But the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes--those frank, terrible eyes? Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wasn't guilty; that tiny thought gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">her an unreasonable joy. Then back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleak heights; he was guilty. Had he not</seg><seg type="columnLine">voiced the ancient lying litany, "I'll never</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wearily she returned to her room, sigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing under an imagined burden of respon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility.

Yet, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to admit, it would be difficult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat with silent contempt a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadfastly refrained from entering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap of words. To be treated with silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt, a man must intrude. She could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not recall the slightest intrusion on Norn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">part. Then she realized that she was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking clearly, that one set of vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts were battling another set equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague, and that she was very sleepy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later, Norn entered his room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew off his boots.

That would mean no small struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her part, and in the meantime she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be thinking of him.

Would Billy follow the canon</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had entered and cross the back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range, or would he cross over to the canon</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the south? Certainly the Indian would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not turn toward Rain-maker. Had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to hide in the fastnesses of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">timbered mountain, the Indian would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed straight toward the peak. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluded that Billy Snake would do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most baffling thing: follow the canon for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short distance, then turn up a rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributary, and cross over to an equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky tributary to the canon on the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rancher resolved to enter the south</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon, and keep close to the north wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If Billy had not crossed over, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the canon up to the back of the range,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and, turning north, strike the Indian's</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy had done what Norn had surmised.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Indian had turned south up a tribu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary canon, stepping carefully from boulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">to boulder, forcing the girl to imitate his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail-trickery. As they reached the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tributary, Billy halted and peered over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shrub at the desert basin below him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed a sibilant warning to the girl as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpsed a man approaching the mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big canon to the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long he studied the approaching figure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">noting a certain familiarity in the carriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dress.

So the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocking-bird-giver thought to wrest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman from him. Billy's lips drew back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his white teeth. Now was his oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to count, as was the custom of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fathers, a mighty coup. He had stolen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman from a hostile camp; a deed which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boldest warrior might recount with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride. Now he would kill a white man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and give to himself the honors of a chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Norn," he mocked his victim, "seeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mocking Bird that she may sing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but, lo"--and he patted his rifle--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"this shall sing him to sleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl gave him a look of deathless hate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then her tear-streaked face grew dull,</seg><seg type="columnLine">void alike of hope or despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Norn disappeared in the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon, Billy Snake punched the girl with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle.

She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through enough torture to kill a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white woman; yet, despoiled, bruised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody, and hopeless, she plodded on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The floods had wedged in several huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders at the mouth of the tributary</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon where Billy hoped to ambush Norn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The main canon, smooth-walled, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">some twenty paces beyond the boulder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clogged mouth of the tributary.

The gug-gug of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was music to his ears. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could drink no more, he lowered the canteen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked down spitefully at his calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping host.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn had said that the mountains were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only twenty-five or thirty miles distant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That meant that Twenty-eight Palms lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">not more than a dozen miles from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">present camp.

No, not that;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn was bent on retaining the canteen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, there was the matter of food. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangements had Norn made for food</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the mysterious prospect? Doubtless he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had plenty of food and water there. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't hurt the rancher to go without</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and water for a day; he was tough--</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough as rawhide. He, Brown, needed food</seg><seg type="columnLine">and water--especially water. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain to Norn later--when he met him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Hemper.

Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up his grip and tiptoed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn arose quietly. Glancing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">star-strewn sky to get his bearings, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck out in the direction Brown had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brown stumbled along as best he could.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the camp he had soothed himself into</seg><seg type="columnLine">believing that his appropriation of the food</seg><seg type="columnLine">and water would meet with a careless smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Norn. Now, that he was actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his way, he realized that he dreaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing the rancher. But he must not think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that 210W-; -the all-important thing was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">readTHemper--alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A point of panic glowed in some dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">recess of his mind. He thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">North star, and glanced up at the sky; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky was so thickly sown with stars that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not even distinguish the Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dipper. His had not been a life of star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he gazed at the sky, his lightly-shod</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot struck a cactus. Agony, intense and</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen, followed. He hopped about on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot, whimpering and groaning. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped his luggage and plumped down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand to remove the tiny barbs. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out of the cringing flesh with infinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctance. He was forced to set his light</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws, and jerk quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the last little barb had been jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, he was fairly dripping perspiration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a time he sat motionless, a rumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat-soaked manikin on the vast floor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought of time, and took out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch, and struck a match.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great heavens!" he chokingly exclaimed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it's past midnight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Past midnight, and no loom of palms to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark a safe shelter from the merciless sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would soon rise to torture him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took a long pull at the canteen. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook it, and gasped as he noted how light</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was. There came no heavy swing of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">water, only a light splash. Even as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered the canteen, something stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath his feet and he leaped back con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsively, dropping the canteen. His blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was chilled by the faint, dry, whirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. Then he thought of the precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and fairly blubbered. He lost no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in striking a match, for he was fearful</seg><seg type="columnLine">of picking up the canteen before making</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that no gray rattler was within striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance. The black stain of the wasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">water in the gray sand made him whimper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He snatched up the canteen. Miracle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracles, there was a little water left!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The snake was buzzing in desultory</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion. Brown, after securing his grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bacon and bread, backed slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the menacing sound, turned, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with mincing caution, proceeded toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Witch-talk. A dark spot or a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vermiculated cactus stalk filled him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickening dread. His light shoes and thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">stockings made him feel as though his</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire body were naked and defenseless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours of wandering through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom and no palms to gladden his aching</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. He became conscious of a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain, and suddenly gave way under it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm lost," he whimpered, "lost--lost!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a comforting thought came to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men traveled the desert at night. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would shout for help. He raised his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a cracked scream that seemed to profane</seg><seg type="columnLine">the holy silence. Norn heard that cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream and smiled cynically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brown listened until he heard the ooni,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oom, oom of his heart, but there came no</seg><seg type="columnLine">answering shout. Again he whimpered--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lost, lost, lost!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wanted to drop down in the sand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry, but the fear of snakes kept him erect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he staggered on he thought of Dora</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayne. She was doubtless sweetly sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. In the morning she would appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the hotel porch dressed in cool linen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She would sit there and calmly watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of Hemper. What would she say if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her how he had escaped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert--well, he needed the water more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn. Norn was a hard man, used to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert. He made some attempt to picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">her welcoming him with soft sympathy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bringing him water and bathing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, but the picture was vague and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfactory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then self-pity came to him. Norn</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't treated him fairly. The rancher</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had dragged him out on an insane search</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some mythical prospect. It was Norn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fault that the horses had not been securely</seg><seg type="columnLine">picketed. Everything was Norn's fault;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would tell him so--when he saw him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, utterly fagged, he resolved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare the snakes and rest. He struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">several matches, examined the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully, and sank down, breathing noisily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he could not rest. He felt that all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping, crawling things in the world were</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed toward him. Imagination rose like</seg><seg type="columnLine">some terrible jinnee. Toward dawn he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself shivering, and began groping</seg><seg type="columnLine">for twigs with which to start a fire. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything he touched presented im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placable stickers and thorns, and he moaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave up that project.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     THE dawn was beautiful beyond</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    compare. In the east bloomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">\jT banks of tender rose edged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale gold. The air seemed to sparkle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with life. But the man, lurching to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, was oblivious to the ineffable glory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dawn. His very soul slavered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape from the Hades into which--and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">babbled in self-pity--it had been projected</seg><seg type="columnLine">through no .fault of his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1'hen over the brow of the range of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly hills rose the remorseless sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man was appalled at the scene the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn disclosed. Gray, interminable wastes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reached to the ends of the world. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a house nor a human being in sight. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight was not keen enough to note the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouching figure in the wash a few rods to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The peaks seemed no nearer than they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had yesterday. And there were no palms</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving gleaming green banners of welcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long before noon Brown had drained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canteen, but he still clung to it as a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocking emblem of safety. He had eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the bread, and with difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed a piece of the raw bacon. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid to stop even to broil a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bacon. Under the blazing sun, panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove him forward. He began to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">concessions. If he reached Hemper he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not bother about Norn's ranch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. He would leave there. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">But of the girl? He attempted to vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">her marrying him and going to San Fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisco with him, but the picture was blurred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he could see himself entering a large,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool cafe in that city and having a respectful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">waiter bring him an old-fashioned stein of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice-cold beer. He moaned as he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ice-cold beer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little grip was now a burden that</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxed his last shred of strength. He halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough to hide it securely, as he sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed, in a clump of greasewood. He made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no attempt to mark the spot, but childishly</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoned that he could later return in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable conveyance and secure the grip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By noon he was within a few miles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hemper. His stomach was sagging like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless appendage and his tongue filled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth like a dried sponge. Glittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">points of light stabbed his eyes, his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled, and his hands felt like bloated</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacks of blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn salvaged the little black grip, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not open it. He followed the lurching</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown until he saw him disappear in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass and willows that lined an irrigation</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditch that purled across the road a half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile from the limits of Hemper. The fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was safe now, and would remain for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time at the ditch. The raiTchtT-paade</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little detour to avoid being seen by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">late guest, and soon was seated on the steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Hemper House.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At his request, Uncle Charlie hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring him a pitcher of water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between sips, Norn told Uncle Charlie</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Maria's warning against Brown and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twill, and gave a humorous account of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had finished, Uncle Charlie went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up-stairs and brought down Brown's bag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gage and set it out on the sidewalk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's no room in my house for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharper," the old man declared grimly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he returned to his chair.

He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn on the porch of the hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stage barn-helper brought up a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">cream-colored horse and a black pony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Dora and Dickie came out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl was attired in a riding-habit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">accentuated the gracious contours and lur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing curves of her perfect body. Her hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung in a thick, dark braid and she wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavalierish scarlet hat that sported a jew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eled buckle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie, now beginning to show the bene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial results of dry, bracing air, ran down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps and eagerly mounted his pony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy noted that Norn merely lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat to the girl. A black flood of desire welled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up thickly within ,the gambler as he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">her swing up and into the saddle. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he stood he could discern the rose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tint in her cheeks, and the flash of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">white teeth. She was radiant, a flame of</seg><seg type="columnLine">womanliness that maddened him. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">possess her. With face working and fists</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched he turned from the window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There must be some way to force her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to him. She would never love him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that he was convinced, but he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispense with sentiment if he could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">possess her. Yet there seemed to be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">way--she cared for nothing. But, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped short, there was the boy; she loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gambler entered his little sanctum</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slowly seated himself. A plan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to form in his mind--a dark and</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dora and Dickie cantered down the desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they descended the sharp slope of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass, the cool air of the mountains gave way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to shimmering heat waves rising from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert basin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We could have postponed our ride until</seg><seg type="columnLine">sundown," the girl told her brother who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for pressing on into the desert. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had better return now, laddie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they turned their horses, a lone rider</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged from a great wash that lay a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods beyond them. It was Pete, coming in</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discuss with Hardy certain plans for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wider range of activities, and to fix more</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly the chieftainship with which Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had so carelessly invested him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy had been content to let Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan the campaigns, to simply obey orders;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Pete was of a more individualistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripe. A secret ambition for supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">command now flowered in his heart. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt he did not need Hardy for a mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">crutch, and, unlike Bundy, he had no fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the man. But he knew that the Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence was far-reaching, and that, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">more securely entrenched in power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prestige, he must walk slowly in the gam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bler's shadow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Pete racked up on his powerful*-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, Dora rode ahead of Dickie to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man pass. Pete rode up even with her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slowed his gait to hers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl's face became a mask of haughti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. The intruder evidently intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">preempt Dickie's place. In a swift side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance she noted the heavy gun swinging on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's hip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm in no rush," Pete opened, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such ingratiating friendliness that the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluded to endure him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her uncle had told her that Western men</seg><seg type="columnLine">always spoke to every man, woman and</seg><seg type="columnLine">child they met on the road. After all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no good reason why she should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be civil to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We were just taking a little ride," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said politely. "We found the heat oppress-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ive and turned back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete drew a deep breath. He had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dora on the hotel porch, but there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the width of the street between them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, close to her, he saw that she was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he ever dreamed a woman could be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The superb elegance of her dress and</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment, her erect gracious form, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet eyes shaded by the scarlet hat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thick, gleaming braid that swept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cantle of the saddle, all formed a picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">that filled his hungry eyes--eyes that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known only filthy under-sized Mexican</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">women, slattern white bawds of the border,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the flimsy girls of the desert towns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">camps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet Pete was no fool to blindly throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside caution. Certain primeval desires</seg><seg type="columnLine">flamed up within him, but he fought them</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. She was the loveliest woman he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen, but a saving streak of common</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense told him that she was not to be won</seg><seg type="columnLine">by any of the usual desert methods. Bundy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tried one of those usual methods, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now Bundy sat in camp croaking like a sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">crow. Then there were three men to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider, Hardy, Norn, and Uncle Charlie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His desert intuition told him that Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a watchful and desirous eye on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. No woman as lovely as she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail to attract the gambler's attention. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Norn--well, he had half-killed Bundy</seg><seg type="columnLine">for simply attempting to kiss the girl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Charlie had many friends, and might</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove, if given cause, as relentless as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No, he would present his best side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave a pleasant impression. Later, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure in his" leadership of the gang, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would boldly enter the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, I reckon 'tis hot to folks not used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it," he agreed, widi a bland smile. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's cool up here to what it is ten miles down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many's the time I've left town with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth a-chatterin' and, inside of two hours'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride, be jes' hot--yes, ma'am, hot as could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE EXPATIATED on the climatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions of the desert, and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">her an elaborate description of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desolate country that lay back of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dora smiled at his earnest efforts to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation. Then she glanced back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickie and frowned slightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'll ride on," Pete offered meekly, "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm botherin' you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It doesn't matter," she lightly returned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"though I fear we are giving my brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">more dust than is good for him. He is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">very strong."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hard lines for a boy to be sick," com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miserated Pete, glancing back at Dickie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right; I'll be siftin' along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete's eyes were now like burning topaz</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot with jet, and about his mouth was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn expression that accentuated the pred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">datory curve of his nostrils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She reined in her horse. The desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">rover strove to bid her an elaborate farewell,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but the withdrawal of her presence hurt him</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the pulling of a barbed arrow from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest. He could only turn in his saddle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">call, in a harsh voice he scarcely recognized</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as his own--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-by."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl did not answer. Pete rode into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hemper, bowed over his saddle-horn as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though nursing a wound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dickie rode up to his sister with loud de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands for "spurs and a gun like that cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy had." He had been admiring Pete's</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering Mexican spurs and pearl-handled</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You shall have the spurs," Dora prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised, "but you are not old enough to have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Norn will let me have a revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I go out to his ranch," the boy said, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little rebelliously.

Doubtless, since she had toler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated the smug trickster, Norn now regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">her as a feminine counterpart of the Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">type.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dickie, ever restless, suddenly proposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they dismount and build a camp-fire;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to his sister's astonishment proudly ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibited three matches he had hoarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">against just such an exigency.

So Hardy would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not trust him with the woman, but, never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless, expected him to do the dirty work?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy anticipated no trouble after the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was returned to his sister, for the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason that the Hardy brand would then be</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the girl. Pete debated the feasibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">killmj^tlardy then and there. One light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ifm^nove and the gambler would be a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and dead men have no influence or</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. What then would hinder him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing as Hardy proposed doing? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should Hardy secure the girl and put him</seg><seg type="columnLine">off with a thousand dollars? What was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars compared to such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though there was nothing in Pete's ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression to excite suspicion, the gambler</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely sensed danger. Automatically he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved back a little, and let his hand fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">carelessly inside his coat. Pete knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy generally carried a short gun in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder-holster, and decided to postpone</seg><seg type="columnLine">the killing until a more opportune time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," Pete agreed, crisply. "We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">grab the boy the first chance we get, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">send you word."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the outlaw's mind was busy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans that did not include meekly sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitting to those outlined by Hardy.

He would report the capture of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, collect the money, and then kill the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler. Then he would force the girl to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry him by threatening to do away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then it's a go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete arose with his thumbs inside his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">belt, thus avoiding shaking hands on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have a drink," Hardy invited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, thanks.

My idee is to close in on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch, and pick up the kid so it will look like</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's lost. If he's on the pony, see that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never hits the ground until he's in rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. We'll scatter, and the man that</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabs the kid is to take him to Coyote Wells.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I figger that no man could spot a trail over</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rocky country. Head north of Twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight Palms, and keep to the ridges. Who-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever gets the kid is to leave a cross of rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Twenty-eight Palms. Just lay out some</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones in the shape of across.

As fast as you find</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out that the boy is grabbed, go on to Coyote</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells.

The general orders were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work in close to the ranch during the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make Twenty-eight Palms a night</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy was sore and discouraged. Pete</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not consulted him, and had given him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minor part.

Norn had merely given</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a beating, but Hardy had, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">good cause, pulled him down from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heights of leadership and made him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipher in the eyes of the gang.

Dickie was just a fair rider, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many tilings might happen that would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult in breaking a leg or an arm. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were the big mountain rattlers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lad might not see before it was too late.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was impossible for Norn to be with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickie every minute, and impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the youngster close to the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boy had gained greatly in strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitality, and was bubbling over with cu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riosity regarding the big canon that wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from Norn's ranch into the mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastness of Rain-maker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the days passed Dickie became</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar with the canon, and displayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an amount of self-reliance that Norn</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to feel at ease.

"He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">city-raised, but he has plenty of spirit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There isn't a cowardly hair in his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Got a good brain too, and clever beyond his</seg><seg type="columnLine">years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie found the canon an attractive</seg><seg type="columnLine">playground, but he often longed to dare the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysteries of the desert tliat lay shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sun far below the green fields of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One clear afternoon, when there was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faintest hint of Fall in the air, Dickie</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode up the canon. He was an imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive boy, and often amused himself by cre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ating little dramas in which he took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading part. This habit had been fos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered by ill health which forbade his taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in the usual games and pastimes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength-blessed youngsters. Also, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">read many stories of adventure, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroic characters of the frontier moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his boyish dreams, invested by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">precocious imagination with god-like powers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he came to the stream that brawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the canon, he recalled that his favor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ite hero invariably threw the redskins off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail by riding down the center of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. Immediately he preempted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero's part, listening, smiling contemp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuously, and going through the motions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">examining a rifle. Then, continuing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">play, he turned his pony and rode down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallow stream, and, unnoticed, passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Uie wide cordon Pete had thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the ranch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The complaining voice of the stream was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon stilled in the sands of Big Wash. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad reined in, wondering what a hero</seg><seg type="columnLine">should do when his stream disappears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he discarded the idea of being pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued by Indians and decided that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an explorer lost in the wilds of Africa. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great sunken smooth-floored way, twisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turning mysteriously, invited him on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pony, too, liked the smooth floor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wash, and quickened his pace. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy enjoyed the sense of power and free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom that a good horse gives a rider, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the pony go his way unchecked. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant to rack around abrupt curves, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw in deep breaths of the dry invigorating</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and to hum vague little songs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Dickie's stomach sent him a hunger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning. He visioned the big dining-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ranch-house, and decided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large bowl of bread and milk would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most satisfactory finale to a perfect day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With some misgivings, he noted that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun was setting, and decided to get out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">die wash. He had a vague idea of cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">across country to the ranch. But to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheer banks of the wash offered no</seg><seg type="columnLine">egress, and he was half-minded to double</seg><seg type="columnLine">back over his old trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■	Suddenly the wash flared out and merged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with another great wash beyond which</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mountain loomed. Dusk was settling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and the desert lay shrouded in gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom before the wondering eyes of the boy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Completely turned around, the loom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Witch-talk was to him the towering shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Rain-maker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Recalling that one of his heroes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted to the intelligence of his horse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take him safely through the trackless wilds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dropped the reins over the saddle-horn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and let the old desert pony go his way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the horse had no intention of returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ranch when there was water and green</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass within a few minutes' canter. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">other days he had often visited the sheltered</seg><seg type="columnLine">nook at the foot of Witch-talk, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now headed straight for that desirable graz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie saw a little fire winking through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees and imagined that in some miracu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous fashion he had returned to Norn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pony, intent on reaching the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">racked up eagerly, and it was with difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Dickie reined him in near the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's wanted?" came a strange voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie looked about him. This wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess I'm lost," he answered bravely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy approached the fire, easing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hammer of his rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie dismounted. Bundy seized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad's arm and drew him over to the fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boy looked up and recognized the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had insulted his sister. He jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">free, and drew back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a bad man," he shrilled. "If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were big enough, I'd whip you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy laughed softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You scared my sister," Dickie accused,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a great show of hostility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, kid," Bundy soothed, "you're jes'</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry. I'll get you something to eat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie made a manly attempt to hold his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostile attitude, but weakened before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insistent clamors of his stomach, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's friendliness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy swiftly prepared a meal for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There you are," the man said, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal was ready. "Throw that into you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you'll feel better. That's mountain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep. It'll make the hair grow on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest. Dig into it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie seated himself by the fire and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to eating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know you got reasons for not likin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," Bundy gently admitted, "but I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean to scare your sister. My horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">started pitchin' and I couldn't hold him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm sorry about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS THE boy ate, he found it in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasingly difficult to regard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man as an enemy. Food is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open-sesame to a boy's heart. And then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the man not said he was sorry? A</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman, according to-- IWeMe's code,</seg><seg type="columnLine">always forgave those who admi7tSa'&gt;4ke---</seg><seg type="columnLine">error of their ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When his hunger was appeased, the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided he would forgive the man. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little doubtful as to how to proceed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but decided that shaking hands would indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate suspension of hostilities. So he arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and approached Bundy who was seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turk-fashion by the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy extended his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your 'pology is accepted," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quoting one of his heroes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy grinned and shook the lad's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a thoroughbred," he said; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he held the boy's hand a little longer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">was necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy felt that his luck had turned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gang was at Twenty-eight Palms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to bear the brunt of the battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Norn and Uncle Charlie. The boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in his power, and he proposed to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratiate himself in the lad's favor to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extent that the youngster would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">question his motives. He would take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad to the desert lulls, and follow the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge of the range back into the fastnesses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rain-maker. Norn would, doubtless, strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail of the boy and follow it to Witch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy walked over to Dickie's pony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes, the horse was shod and would leave an</seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unmistakable trail. But once on the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge of the desert range, even a shod horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">would leave no trail. Norn would follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail to the desert hills, but would lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on the ridge. Then there was the possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility of the rancher clashing with the gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">before reaching the desert hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Secure in some retreat among the crags of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rain-maker, he would fit up a little camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the boy, and prevail on him to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main there. Then he would take the horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slip down to Hemper. There, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cover of darkness, he would contrive to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get word to the girl that he had rescued her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother from the gang, but that the boy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been weakened by the harsh experience, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too ill to move. He would tell the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the lad was constantly calling for her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that he believed the boy would die</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless she immediately came to his rescue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He would demand that she secretly</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompany him back to the boy. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell her of Hardy's part in the affair, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vince her that he had endangered his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">by coming into town. He would point out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fffe only thing for her to do would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">to safeguard 'the one man who knew of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's whereabouts. If she threatened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">betray him, he would pretend to wash his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of the whole affair. If she asked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">why he had rescued the boy from the gang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would indicate the fact of the gambler</seg><seg type="columnLine">having deposed him from leadership as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive for revenge, and, for good measure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretend that he desired to make amends for</seg><seg type="columnLine">having insulted her. To prove the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his statements he would show her some</seg><seg type="columnLine">article belonging to the boy, or he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly prevail on the lad to write her a</seg><seg type="columnLine">note.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, when he had the girl in his power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would work south by degrees, and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexico. Perhaps, after tiring of her, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would exact from her a heavy ransom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">release her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was uncertain as to what he would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of one thing, however, he was certain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His revenge against Hardy would be full</seg><seg type="columnLine">and complete. Pete, too, would have good</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause to remember him. He would find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to get a mocking message to the gang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll show 'em all where I head in," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered, as he returned to the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Feelin' better, kid?" he asked, smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," Dickie politely assented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How'd you like to have me take you</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Norn's tonight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd like it," the boy said cheerfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, then, you jes' rest till I get my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawse ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy led the way from the camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">veering south to strike the desert hills far</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond Twenty-eight Palms. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray night, but the man knew every trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wash in the basin, and without diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty entered the desert hills, leading the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's horse, since Dickie was beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show signs of fatigue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess we'd better camp," Bundy told</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy, when they came to the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the rock-ribbed canons whose tribu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taries led up to the barren ridge over which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he expected to swing north to Rain-maker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's water here, and I'm kind o' lost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, you're tired. Ain't you tired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kid?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," admitted the boy wearily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy helped the lad dismount, and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled a blanket he had tied on the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lay down on this," he said, spreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the blanket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," murmured the stiff and weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickie, sleepily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy wrapped the blanket about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, tucking it under his feet snugly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisting that the lad keep his arms under</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover. When the man had finished tuck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the blanket, the boy looked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swathed mummy.	^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie was soon fast asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy, though he had no blanket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled out on the ground, with a saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a pillow, and his weapons close at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he, too, was asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a long time the big mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattler watched the huge recumbent</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure. His snakeship had ventured</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a snug retreat not far from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring, in quest of rats. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaving along, concerned entirely with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hunger, when suddenly before him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge mountain stirred. Immediately he</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiled, and sounded his warning. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the mountain failed to make any hostile</seg><seg type="columnLine">move, the snake relaxed his tense coil, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded to crawl away. But the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved again, and he immediately resumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tense coil, sounding his dry, deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy was lying on his back, but some</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">irregularity in the ground made that posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion uncomfortable, and gradually the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious mind became aware of that dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort, and signaled the body to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. Bundy turned over, his right arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended. Then he thrust out his hand, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest his arm full length on the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rattler saw that hand approach him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in what he believed to be a menacing fashion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and struck out and hooked his fangs in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">linger. Bundy awoke with heart-shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenness, to hear the low whirr of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattler. He sucked in his breath as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a dart of pain in his finger. He grabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun and fired at the dark mound from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which ensued the dry, deadly buzzing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roar of the gun jerked poor Dickie</seg><seg type="columnLine">from slumber with a suddenness that nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked his nerves. He fought his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the blanket, whimpering and half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing. The darkness and the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">environment into which the bellow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy six-shooter had suddenly precipitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy, made Mm forget for the nonce</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was a brave man, and he relapsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into whimpering childishness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy, disregarding all caution, found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a match, and in feverish haste started a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He got me," sobbed the man. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a mad, unreasonable rage, he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">trampling the snake. Dickie stared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild spectacle, his little heart pounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiously against his ribs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Bundy trampled the rattler, he cursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly and hopelessly. There was a wail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing note of doom in his voice that made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad's skin prickle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fire flamed up, and the man saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's white, drawn face through a red haze</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rage, and realized he was wasting tune.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He leaped over the fire, rasping out in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come here, boy--quick!

The sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood nauseated him, and his senses reeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he thought of putting the finger in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, but he seized Bundy's hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithfully obeyed the low-toned directions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There, that's good," Bundy said, grate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.

He broke off a piece of greasewood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twisted the handkerchief with all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. Then he pressed his arm against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side to hold the tourniquet in position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the rattler that had bitten Bundy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was old, and the venom he had injected</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the veins of the man was like liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy realized that he must get to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor or perish. Like most desert-rals</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had a contempt for rattlesnakes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never bothered about carrying an anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dote for snake-bite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was only one thing to do, take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy and ride to Hemper.

A childless squaw had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him cooing and gurgling in a "grub"</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, following a massacre of some foolhardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Argonauts. She had taken the baby to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her heart, and, in the years that followed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he not only became versed in Indian cun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, but acquired a snake-like quickness</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the white man's weapon, the six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooter. Ere he had the suspicion of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair on his face he had killed his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Killing followed killing until even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most hardened desperadoes of the then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lawless Southwest came to regard the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Apache Kid as the apogee of deadliness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Many gun-twirlers secretly longed to kill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him, not through any desire to benefit the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">general public, but to acquire at one shot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Kid's red fame. Now and then the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mexican border was reminded of the fact</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that he who let such ambitions goad him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into action, invariably departed this life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ere a watch could tick a second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now, to the Apache Kid, in the fulness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of his power, and playing a lone hand in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the game of outlawry along the Mexican</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">border, came luring accounts of a woman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of wondrous beauty in a town a week's ride</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At first the Kid had been indifferent,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">deeming the report in line with those of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fabulous mountains of gold in desert infer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nos; but men continued to talk of "the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl at Hemper," and gradually his interest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was aroused. Money he could secure by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">playing cards with men who were afraid to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">win from him, and killing had become more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or less a routine.

He admitted no inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est, yet he was aware of a strange restless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. That night he drifted north thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, and the next day killed a Mexican</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a monte-game dispute. The Kid was</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally irritable, and the strange rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness had not tended to blunt the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fangs of his temper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he mounted and drifted north</seg><seg type="columnLine">some forty or fifty miles. In a little stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">station on a bleak mesa, he met, face to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, the brother of a man he had killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Arizona. The Kid frowned darkly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brother of the victim of the killer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning lead passed on to strengthen his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves with strong waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Always did he have to kill men, thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kid peevishly. In time this brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the man who had bowed to his lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come, seeking satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kid did not have long to wait. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, maddened with vile whisky, charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a doonvay, firing as he advanced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Kid's right gun barked briefly, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man slumped to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night the Kid rode forty miles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few days later sauntered into Chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy's saloon, his fame preceding him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy accorded the youth with the rat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlesnake jaw and restless, bloodshot eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the utmost deference. The gambler's atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude deeply impressed certain officers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the law who looked to him for guidance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all matters. Then the Kid's appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not belie his fame. He looked "bad,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his glance was like a knife-thrust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy extended to the Kid the hospi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tality of his place. The youth, oddly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, did not drink, but he was an invet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erate gambler. Hardy steered him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faro layout, signaling to the pasty-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealer to permit the visitor to win a rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonable amount.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kid was a nervous player, and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded plenty of elbow-room. His deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">darting glances soon cleared a space around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; and, as he began to win, he smiled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious, mirthless smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he decided he had won enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cashed in. The eyes of every man in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the saloon followed him as he sauntered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. He whirled on them with start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling suddenness and, as one man, the watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers flinched. He smiled comprehension of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fears, and edged through the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll have to let me go if the Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes back," the faro-dealer whined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy. "I'd as soon deal to a rattler."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Charlie, in his chair on the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch, saw the Kid approaching, and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Dora with more excitement than she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen him display.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get up-stairs--quick, girl!" he puffed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy whispers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the matter with you, uncle?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she exclaimed, unable to see any cause for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his intense excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, before Uncle Charlie could answer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kid's spurs jingled on the steps, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man gripped the arms of his chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared fixedly at the intruder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl saw an under-sized youth in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">early twenties, bow-legged and slope-shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered from years of riding. He was armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with two heavy, pearl-handled revolvers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that struck her as nothing omw^aL</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since her arrival in Hemper she had seen'</seg><seg type="columnLine">many armed men. Her feminine mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unschooled in the signs of deadliness, failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to note the murderous cruelty deep-etched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the face of the Apache Kid. To her he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely some cowboy come 'to speak a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few words to her uncle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She suddenly became aware of a deathly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stilness broken only by the jingle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger's spurs as he deliberately ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached her. She could see men across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street, and there was an odd intentness</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their attitudes. She saw Hardy back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breast-high swinging doors of his sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loon; and he, too, was intently watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the youth who, to her annoyance, had halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to her, and was staring down at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kid, having done as he pleased since</seg><seg type="columnLine">boyhood, saw no reason why he should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell this woman of rare beauty the purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his visit to Hemper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I come three hundred miles to see you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told her, in a low expressionless voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and I don't think I'm goin' to leave this</seg><seg type="columnLine">town loser."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNCLE CHARLIE moved slightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">praying for the old Sharpe's and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead rest. The Kid flashed him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance of deadly warning. The old man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face turned a ghastly purple, and in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes came a look of dumb pathos.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not fear that held the landlord motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less in his chair, but his knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental processes of killers, and the realiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of his own helplessness. He knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as the Apache Kid struck swiftly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest unusual move, and he felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be sheer folly to throw his life away</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless the Kid went beyond mere words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several moments the killer appraised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beauty of the girl; and then, in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">same expressionless voice--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckon I'm goin' to like you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was too much, even from a cowboy</seg><seg type="columnLine">who might be a friend of her uncle. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose, and being taller than the Kid, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at him haughtily; and then turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her uncle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Uncle," she said in her coolest and most</seg><seg type="columnLine">impersonal tone, "this man is annoying me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Will you please order him away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">J&amp;tSTK.id lifted his upper lip in a wolf-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin. It touched his vein of evil humor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine a fat, old man ordering him to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything. He was half-tempted to .kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man just to impress the girl. Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie read that murderous thought in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark face and twitching hands, and held</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself motionless and mute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her uncle's failure to protect her hurt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, as well as sorely puzzled her.

She turned to enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office, but the Kid blocked the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me pass," she commanded, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressing some insolent servant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This amused the Kid. She was a thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughbred, and he would find much pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in taming her. Apparently she was una-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ware of the identity of the man she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressing; therefore, to a certain extent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would enlighten her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That old man over there," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly, darting an ophidian glance at Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie. "Do you want to see that old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">die?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl grew sick with horror as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly comprehended the threat of ruth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less murder his question carried.

The Kid came close to her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one slim hand crept out and smoothed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. She shuddered at his touch, her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his pearl-handled guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kid's hand strayed down her shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and arm, and closed about her wrist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lifted her hand and examined the white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth fingers curiously; then his gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">focused on a ring she wore, a filigreed gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">circlet set with a cluster of diamonds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubies. In a childish mood he removed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring and placed it on one of his own slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must have plenty of dinero," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked, his mood now that of a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage playing with a gaud. "How much</seg><seg type="columnLine">it cost?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dora was now fully aware that the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">before her was more dangerous than a rat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlesnake. Any moment the murderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood might return; she must humor him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not a nightmare, but stark reality.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A deadly stranger had threatened her un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cle's life, and removed a ring from her finger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her uncle had drifted away from her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now vague and remote. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men within call, but they seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen, incapable of movement. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone--and helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never before had she faced the terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact of woman's helplessness. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no stronger than Maria had been when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paiute had roused her and drove her to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. There had been a time, ages ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when her woman's helplessness seemed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">charming attribute. In that other world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where money ruled and police watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">every corner, women prided themselves on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their helplessness. In this world, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing counted save the ability to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, there was no romance in helpless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, no charm in weakness. Here, despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wealth, her refinement and culture, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind infinitely superior to that of the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture before her, she was just a helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there was no man to whom she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn for protection. Then suddenly a figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">took form in the mirror of her mind, a sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reliable, dominant being who was all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was not. To that figure her thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned with joyful relief.

The gambler realized that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must say the right words in exactly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right way, or be shot down. Further, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler knew the psychology of fear. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that it was entirely possible for a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Kid's reputation to intimidate a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. To successfully attack this master</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun-twirler, there would have to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader, ready and willing to die. Such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader was not to be secured in Hemper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the gun-fighters that might be bribed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into daring the Kid's lead were in the des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ert, watching for an opportunity to seize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gambler's answer was toneless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">impersonal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man's woman is his own business," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, flicking the ash from his cigar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kid's searching gaze played recur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rently across Hardy's mask-like face like</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashes of sheet-lightning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A good way to look at it," darkly com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented the killer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he looked down at the ring, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held up his hand for Hardy to inspect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting.

A right purty ring--hey, hombre?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This strained the gambler's self-control</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the breaking-point. Volcanic rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">seethed within him, and through a red haze</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glittering ring mocked him. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held himself steady, and no flicker of flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes gave hint of the storm of rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">within him. He even essayed a smile as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly remarked--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothin' like bein' a favorite with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladies."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pretended to admire the ring, his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">groping madly for some sure method of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blotting out the man who had so calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddled his plans. If the gang captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy, it was plain that he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry the girl until the Kid was out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Then there was Norn to be consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered. While the rancher evidently had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in the girl, he would hold himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for the boy's safety. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid blocking the way, Norn would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to ascertain that the gang had cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured the boy, and immediately conclude</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were holding the lad for ransom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn would then come directly to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing that he controlled the gang, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that meant gun-smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gambler's attitude of indifference</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to satisfy the Kid, for he resumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bucking of the faro game, much to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweating agitation of the dealer Hardy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected to relieve. But never for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment did the killer relax his distrustful vigi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lance. He insisted that the rear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon be kept clear of men, and his ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">restless eyes traveled from lay-out to doors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from doors to the faces of the men lounging</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the bar, and back to the lay-out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy, once, was on the point of snatch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up the sawed-off shotgun, and taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long chance; but he could not quite free</seg><seg type="columnLine">his soul of the awe of the Kid's red record.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a hanger-on slipped in, and, pretend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to ask for money, managed to whisper</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the gambler:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Kid's goin' to take the girl south</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him tomorrow. Uncle Charlie's penned</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in, and turnin' everybody back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy gave the hanger-on a coin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved him away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, thought the gambler, did not help</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters. To force the girl to marry him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have to tell her of her brother's</seg><seg type="columnLine">peril. Now, Uncle Charlie, having noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friendly relations with the Kid, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not permit him within speaking distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the girl. While the Kid might brave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder of the old Sharpe's, the gambler</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted that he had no stomach for facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buffalo gun. Even if he could get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl, there was the Kid still blocking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. Therefore, the Apache Kid must</seg><seg type="columnLine">die ere the dawn broke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps the killer would relax his vigi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lance; then one desperate move, and both</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrels of the shotgun. But he must wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he had a perfect drop on the killer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">If the Kid caught him reaching for the shot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, the gun-master would kill him as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a score of men, within the space of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">split second. To be sure, he must Mve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun cocked and on the man before dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered. Even then he was doubtful of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to pull the triggers before the Kid's</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic guns Hashed into action. And there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no record of the Kid ever having missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the Kid toyed with faro, a town</seg><seg type="columnLine">character, known as "Sunshine," entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saloon, stopped short at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar, and stared fascinatedly at the killer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some men twitted Sunshine concerning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big, rusty revolver he carried in a raw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide holster.

Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">killer noted that the big man was the butt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of various humorous remarks and classified</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as harmless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sunshine did not intrude on the Kid, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved from one point of vantage to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, staring at him with round rabbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, fascinated by the killer's deadlinesSr</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stare of the harmless Sunshine amused</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watchers; even the Kid lifted his upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">lip in his wolf-like grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your head's open," bantered the killer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look out for flies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this sally the watchers laughed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">courtiers laugh at the mildewed jest of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">king; but Sunshine continued to stare, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face empty as that of a hypnotist's subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The laughter of the watchers caused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid to unbend further.

The Kid re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved him of his big gun, and made a futile</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to turn the rusty, empty cylinder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he blew cigaret smoke in the muzzle;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, with one lightning move, tossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun back into the rawhide holster. Sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine looked down at his gun with the blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment of a country yokel in whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat a magician has discovered a setting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eggs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NORN considered the canon a safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">playground for Dickie.

The Mexican had worked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">round-up for Norn, and, at times, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given permission to hunt on the big ranch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus, Pedro was most familiar with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trails that led down the sides of the canon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the Mexican were discovered by Norn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete reasoned, the rancher's suspicions</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be aroused so quickly as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would if he found a white man lurking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his canon. Then, Pete believed, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican could be trusted to do as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">told. Pete knew that Pedro stood in awe of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger, and was confident that the Mexican</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not dare to play a crooked game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pedro dragged his horse down a trail that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a goat would hesitate to follow, and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor of the canon a short distance below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waterfall. He concealed his horse in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some alders and proceeded to watch the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn, screened from the Mexican's view</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the trees and undergrowth, rode up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waterfall. There, he turned into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon road and began searching for fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks of Dickie's pony. Apparently the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boy had not come to the falls. The rancher</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismounted and led his horse some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the road, studying the old tracks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly his eye caught the movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some creature in the alders. He slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and secured his saddle-gun. Venison</seg><seg type="columnLine">was always welcome. With the utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution he approached the alders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mexican was intently watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road beyond him, and, when Norn spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he sprang to his feet chattering like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled monkey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time the rancher studied the shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Pedro, and then abruptly ordered--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Drop your rifle!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Mexican promptly obeyed. Norn</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieved him of his six-shooter and knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," demanded the rancher, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly, dominating note in his voice, "why</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you in my canon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mexican began babbling about hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but Norn silenced him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You did not come to the house and se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cure my permission. You slipped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon like a coyote. Did you expect to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find deer in the road? Why should I not</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill you as I would a coyote?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mexican resumed his babbling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don Keeng" was a generous man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no thought for one little deer. "Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keeng" was also a man with many things</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his mind, and must not be disturbed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man merely desiring to hunt on "this</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificent ranch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Pedro's babbling was wasted on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rancher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Walk ahead of me," Norn ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drove the Mexican back to his horse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he secured a rope, and presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro was bound hand and foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn then took the cleaning-rod from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding-place in the butt of his gun, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully screwed it together. His next</seg><seg type="columnLine">move was to build a little fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he laid the cleaning-rod in the fire, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed with quiet assurance:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This will make you speak the truth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro. In a little while you will have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste of hell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn knew every twist and turn of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican mind. If the gang had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old truce and was plotting some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">devilment, this was an excellent oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to get first-hand information.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The possible capture of Dickie by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang did not enter his mind. The boy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably at the ranch-house now. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rancher was thinking of his herds. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gang about to exact tribute from him?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If so, he must prepare for war. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention of burning the Mexican, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was confident that Pedro would speak the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth when he felt the iron's hot breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pedro, on the other hand, had only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture of the boy in mind. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching Norn's every move with terror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">widened eyes. When the rancher placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the iron in the fire, he sucked in his breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah, the torture! Mother of God, who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">endure the fire torture!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn pulled off the Mexican's boots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he examined the iron and thrust it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in the flames.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not hot enough," he observed distinctly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Pedro's benefit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the iron was red-hot, Norn sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly jerked it from the flames and sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agely approached the Mexican.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pedro's soul sickened as he felt the hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath of the iron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak the truth, thou dog," gritted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn in Spanish, "or walk through hell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the cross, the truth I speak!" howled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frantic Mexican.

'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four men under Desert Jack's ordffrs^-</seg><seg type="columnLine">were soon ready for the trail, heavily armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prepared for any desert emergency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn mounted his spotted horse, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reserved for long rides, and racked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hemper road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was plain, thought Norn, that Hardy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing the girl's wealth, expected a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ransom for the boy. There could be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other motive. Certainly the gambler would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not expect to win the girl's favor by such</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the saloon, and even with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid, stood the gaping Sunshine, staring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the killer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn entered swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You, Sunshine," he shouted, with well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feigned rage, "what do you mean by steal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my horse?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poor Sunshine, stunned by the accusa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and chilled with fear, could only blink</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn advanced a pace, and pulled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns. This movement caused the Kid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face the seemingly angry man and to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands on the butts of the low-hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns. Then, realizing that it was not his</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair, he relaxed, pleasantly anticipating</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodshed. The killer's hands dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from his gun butts. He took out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">book of cigaret-paper. The fool had stolen</seg><seg type="columnLine">a horse and would soon die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy was deeply puzzled.

A half-intoxicated man</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked out his gun and began firing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chimneyless lamp blazed up and the sag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging cheesecloth ceiling caught fire.

Then it oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred to one of the watchers that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole town might burn, and he raised a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry of "Fire! Fire! Eire!" This stirred the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzed ones into activity, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street was soon full of excited men, rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hither and thither, bawling conflicting</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders and acting not unlike a drove of</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantic cattle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn was near the edge of the porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Hardy hurled the girl into his arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of her hands struck down his gun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she fell heavily against him.

Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the flames gained headway in the dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell, he realized that he could not now</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect the men of Hemper to join him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the search for Dickie. The town was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion, and a posse friendly to him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landlord could not be raised until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hemperites had regained some semblance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of calmness.

Hardy was, doubtless, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert now, and, when he heard of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction of his saloon, would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitate to recoup his loss by demanding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering ransom for the boy. The situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, Norn concluded, called for immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">action, and he resolved to take the trail with</seg><seg type="columnLine">what men he had. He would do all in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to recover the boy, and, if he failed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would then send a man to town to sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon aid. By the time he and his men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now waiting at Witch-talk, had thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouted the desert basin, the friendly Hem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perites might be induced to listen to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeal for help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn found the proprietor of the hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ware store, and quickly purchased a rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ammunition. At the stage stable, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rancher grumbled at the inferiority of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse he was forced to accept, doubting</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the animal would last until he recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered his faithful pinto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cautiously Norn rode into the desert.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy might double back and ambush</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, since the gambler had not only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tireless pinto but the heavy hunting-rifie</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hanging on the saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUNDY, as he began to reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly, realized that he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope to reach Hemper in time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor to save him from an agonizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. He might, however, be able to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Norn's ranch. But the problem was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the ranch without being sighted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gang. He knew that Pete and his men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now at Twenty-eight Palms, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not slip past their camp before</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn. Even if he turned the boy over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gang, he could not escape the charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">treachery. They would instantly deduce</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was the snake venom in his veins</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had brought him back to them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no desire to play fair. Also, no member of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gang possessed any antidote for snake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bite. He had much to lose and nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain by returning to the gang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite the desperateness of his situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, the man's mind was not solely occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied with selfish thoughts.

But he surrendered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind black with snake-thoughts, poison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts, death-thoughts.

He found that such</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts kept his mind clear, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts of self confused his sense of direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and weakened his resistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tributary that led into Tunnel Canon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clogged with cat-claws that forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to dismount and lead their horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man, holding firmly to the resolve</seg><seg type="columnLine">to guide the boy to safety, floundered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the implacable cat-claw, oblivious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its cruel hooked thorns. But when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered Tunnel Canon, the old thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged the citadel of his resolve, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumped down in the sand, his shirt in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatters, his face, hands and chest bleeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">from countless scratches. Dickie had fared</seg><seg type="columnLine">much better; the man had broken a trail for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lad now saw that the man was again</seg><seg type="columnLine">losing courage, and he repeated the small-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy anathema which brought Bundy to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, cursing himself for a spineless quitter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And once more he mounted his horse, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the venom singing a song of blind hate in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">veins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tunnel Canon, though its walls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">abrupt, was spacious and smooth-floored.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ponies racked on freely, Dickie leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look fer tunnel--left-hand side," Bundy</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned, not quite sure that he was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right canon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly Dickie discerned a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">blot in the canon wall, and veered over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's the tunnel!" he joyously ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "We're all right now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep goin'," the man groaned, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode even with the boy. "Keep goin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SSpP THERE was now a pallid hint &lt;?f</seg><seg type="columnLine">pidawn in the eastern sky. The worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and weary lad sniffed the aromatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn-scents, and felt his spirits revive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon would come the kindly sunlight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all would be well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they reached the mouth of Tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canon, Rain-maker had emerged from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom, and stood, wreathed in shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">haze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's the ranch!" shouted Dickie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"See the trees and the house? That's it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the habit of resistance had now</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gained a foothold in the mind of the man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were in sight of the ranch, and there he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could at least secure whisky which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to counteract the effect of rattle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake venom. He would fight his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. The boy would not again have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remind him that he was a coward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He might have ridden on without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">break, had he not thought to examine his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and arm in the clear morning light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The swelling gave his courage a severe set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. He sagged forward, and his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly halted. He slid from the saddle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood, his arms hanging over the horse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, a hopeless, sodden figure of despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, please hurry," Dickie began</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's the ranch," Bundy said mourn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. "Go to it. I'm sick--sick-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll stay with you, then," the boy calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided. "I won't leave you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Huh, thought the man, the kid was a real</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend who wouldn't leave him to die like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisoned wolf, alone and forsaken. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy was game, and he, a man was giving up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrendering while he yet had strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He managed to heave himself into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie led the way across Big Wash, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the ranch-house. Bundy, now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had rcached the end of the terrible trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumped completely and would have fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the horse had not Desert Jack caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in his strong arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He took me from some men and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">me home," quickly vouchsafed Dickie, true</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his promise. Then, in answer to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled exclamation from Desert Jack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he excitedly poured forth a torrent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Big rattlesnake bit him--I cut his</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger--then I sucked the blood out--then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was going to die--and then-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You look purty peaked yourself, kid,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted the foreman, as he beckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Pedro. "Go to the house and lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dickie rode up to the porch and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted. Now that he was free of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsibility, weariness overpowered him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it required a desperate effort for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the big divan in the living-room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he sprawled out, and fell into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamless sleep of one who has fought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good fight and won. And, to the end, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his pact with Bundy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Pedro's assistance, Desert Jack</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">half-carried Bundy to the bunk-house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The foreman deeming whisky a sovereign</seg><seg type="columnLine">remedy for snakebite, forced great swallows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the raw liquor down Bundy's tliroat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, calling on the Chinese servants for</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistance, he bound up Bundy's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arm in raw beef.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd better hit fer town, Pedro,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Desert Jack told the Mexican, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished poulticing Bundy's arm. "Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doc Cunningham out here on the jump."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the foreman thought of Norn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders. The rancher would hold him re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsible for any treachery on the Mexican's</seg><seg type="columnLine">part. But Pedro was the only available</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. A Chinese could not be trusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from a house. Also, the boy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe, and the holding of Pedro now was of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the Mexican turned to go, Desert Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned him that "a quick killin'' would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reward "fer any greaser tricks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The foreman stood in the doorway of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunk-house, rifle in hand, and watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican depart. Then he returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring of whisky down the throat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hapless Bundy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy, in his way, had always been far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more considerate of the Mexican's feelings</seg><seg type="columnLine">than had Pete or any of the other desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">rovers who classified "greasers" with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians and negroes. The Mexican was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a stranger to gratitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Desert Jack's warning was unnecessary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his heart of hearts, the Mexican was</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary of the rather lonely life his color had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced him to lead. He was a member of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gang, but none of the white men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">barring Bundy, had ever shown him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of kindness, or counseled with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would slip into Hemper, find the doctor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then flee north, far beyond the gang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach. In sweet San Gabriel he would find</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own people, a guitar to strum, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark-eyed woman to make time pass quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aye, he was fortunate to escape from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated gringos, the ever-restless ones, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seekers of trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though he gave a grunt of astonishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the havoc the fire had wrought, Pedro, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he entered Hemper, did not pause to inspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoking ruins, but trotted past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel intent on reaching the doctor's office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reined in abruptly as he caught a glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the doctor coming out of the drug-store,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hailed the medico just as he paused at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hotel steps to speak to Dora.</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bundy heem get snakebite.

"I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">start right away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mexican, having paid his debt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratitude to Bundy, galloped around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel, and the desert country knew him no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pedro's display of graceful horsmanship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he dashed past, attracted Uie girl's atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and she vaguely recalled fragments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his speech to the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Snakebite--Norn ranch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some men, poking in the ashes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins, shouted to the doctor as he past</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped in his buckboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, the thought that Dickie might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been bitten by a rattlesnake plunged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mind with terrifying suddenness. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor was now beyond hailing distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she ran into the hotel to tell Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlie of her fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Dora had slept a few hours, the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had guarded his property all night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no thought of sleep. Now he was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paring to give his old body the rest it de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded, and was in no mood to be alarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by unfounded forebodings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be foolish, Dora," he grumbled, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tugged at his shoes. "If Dickie was bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd bring him in on the jump. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't suppose that Doc Cunningham</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't tell you if it was the boy that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nipped? I swear, Dora, you're like most</seg><seg type="columnLine">wimmin--always a-borrowin' trouble. Holy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cripes, I never put in such a night in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life! Now run along and let me sleep."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But, uncle," she persisted, "it might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickie. You know he is so daring and</seg><seg type="columnLine">impetuous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Doc Cunningham ought to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in a few hours and then you'll know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now let me sleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly Dora returned to the porch. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour dragged by and then she saw one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage stable helpers start up the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bring my horse, please," she called to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helper; and hurried upstairs to don her</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding-habit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, as she cantered down the desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, she amused herself with picturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dickie's surprise when she rode up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch. Her forebodings, she now realized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had arisen from loneliness. Dickie had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been gone a long time, it seemed to her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was merely lonesome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lad would have many stories to tell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and Norn would bring them back to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hers was a mind that rarely long enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained disagreeable thoughts or memories.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was on her way to Dickie now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would, doubtless, see the man she</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, she had a good feminine excuse for</seg><seg type="columnLine">invading Norn's little empire. She would</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell him, calmly and without the quiver of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eyelash, she had heard that some one at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranch had been bitten by a snake, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had come to make sure the unfortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nate was not Dickie. Then Norn would</seg><seg type="columnLine">show her the ranch, and in the quiet balmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening they would return to town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She admitted a childish curiosity re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding the man's surroundings and manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of living. Did he possess all those things of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Uncle Charlie had hinted, books, rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">furniture, piano and servants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that she loved a man, she found she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not reason calmly and lucidly. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind toyed with pleasant externals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to consider primitive facts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Apache Kid, Hardy, the fire, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now vague memories falling back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows of obscurity before the irresistible</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance of love and hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE was in the Springtime of youth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day was matchless, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful horse was bearing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly to her twin loves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course the man had never spoken a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of love to her, but that did not matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He» might resist for a time, but would</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally bow as she had bowed to the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutable law. She smiled as she thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any man attempting to resist the law of</seg><seg type="columnLine">love--the law that governed the universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She surrendered to tender thoughts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn. What a restless being he was, ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">in action. Yet all his deeds sprang from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his great unselfishness. He had no thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of self, no small, bickering egotism, no desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to parade his masculinity. He was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean as a pine on the mountain top, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound and as strong. The love of such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was worth any effort, any sacrifice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In time they would come to an intimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding, with none of the commonal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ities and jealousies that marked the average</seg><seg type="columnLine">love. They would go through life. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here she paused in her dreaming and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at herself. Surely she was taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal for granted. She was building</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a beautiful air-castle that might fall with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash and bury her heart and its hopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lean prospector overtook her, but did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not attempt that bland smirking the average</seg><seg type="columnLine">male imagines paves the way to woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor. He recognized her as the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">for whom King Norn had shot the Apache</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid. Thus, to him, Norn's protection</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked before her, a deadly menacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow that warned:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For this woman I killed the killer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty. Pause at your peril."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The prospector did not pause. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled around her, eyes to the front, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed on, omitting even the conven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional "Howdy ma'am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl marveled a little at the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">actions. Heretofore, every man she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">met on her rides had volunteered much in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation concerning the weather and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, and had favored her with wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bland smiles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently she discerned a man approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He was belaboring a couple of burros.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as he saw her, he turned the burro</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the road, and pretended to be occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with straightening the packs. She recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized him as the shaggy raconteur who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once sought to entertain her on the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch. He did not look up as she passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other prospector had given him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried account of the passing of the Apache</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid. The shaggy one heaved a sigh of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief as she passed. Not for a panful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuggets would he have accosted her. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever harmless his greeting, it might be mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">construed, and he proposed not to toy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She met the westbound stage whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver and passengers had been fully posted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the lean prospector. The driver touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat, but the passengers of the coach sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight, and refrained from the usual road</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasantries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dora was familiar with the main road,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but had never ventured to explore the branch</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led to Norn's ranch. But she antici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pated no difficulty; there was Rain-maker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ranch lay in the lap of the mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned into the ranch road, confident</seg><seg type="columnLine">and happy. Dreamily she watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lizards speed through the sandy aisles be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the greasewood and squat burro</seg><seg type="columnLine">weed. She smiled at an inquisitive jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit that raised up and stared at her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, foolish eyes, the sunlight redly illumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nating his thin ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sweep and majesty of the mountain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded desert intensified the naive sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicity of thought that now seemed so</seg><seg type="columnLine">delightful to her. All that cultivated re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve, that chill, aloof attitude of the specta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor, those experiences with strutting mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culine egoes had faded into remoteness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She felt the kinship of nature, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">childhood called to her with a sweet, insis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent voice. She noted some stones set in</seg><seg type="columnLine">orderly fashion, by the roadside, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the play-houses built of sticks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones in the long ago. She was tempted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismount, and again build a play-house of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticks and stones. Love demands natural-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and will have none of the artificial,</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of the cold wisdom of experience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, children attract love with little</seg><seg type="columnLine">or no effort, and when grown-ups come</seg><seg type="columnLine">under its spell they, too, see through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl recalled slipping her hand into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn's with no regret for her vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride. It had been a perfectly natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">move; she would do it again, she sliamelessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted, if he gave her an opportunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently she came to a fork of the ranch</seg><seg type="columnLine">road that momentarily puzzled her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to take the road most plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked with evidences of recent travel. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight outfit, bound for the mines beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert hills, had left broad wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks and the thick imprint of many hoofs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She rode on, following the broad track of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the freight wagons. She noted that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road veered slightly from the mountain, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was confident that it would soon turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Rain-maker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Desert atmosphere and distances are</seg><seg type="columnLine">deceiving. It now seemed to the girl that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was approaching the mountain; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reality she was headed for a pass in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert hills between Norn's ranch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tunnel Canon. She had not the faintest</seg><seg type="columnLine">conception of the vast proportions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain. There it was, apparently direct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly in front of her. She crossed Big Wash</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rode on steadily toward the pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When a short distance from the mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tunnel Canon, she glanced to the left and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpsed the buildings and the trees of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn ranch. She was about to turn from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road when she discerned a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders approaching from the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiie great wash she had crossed. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not riding in a compact group, but were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out in a long line whose left flank</seg><seg type="columnLine">6o</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">intervened between her and the ranch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some intuitive sense of danger prompted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to turn toward the mouth of Tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately, the riders changed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, proving to her that she was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarry they were seeking. The panic of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hunted overwhelmed her, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">galloped recklessly to the foot of the ridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose eroded and crumbling side formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the far wall of the canon. A fearful back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward glance convinced her that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing in on her. Frantically she urged her</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse up the slope of the ridge. Then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she again glanced back, she glimpsed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spotted horse. She pulled in abruptly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed weakly. How foolish she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been to give way to such an unreasonable</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic. Norn always rode a spotted horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and here he was with his cowboys, trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtake her and give her safe conduct to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ranch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But was it Norn? Something unfamiliar</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the riding of the man on the pinto checked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natural impulse to ride down the slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet them. The rider on the spotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse lacked Norn's easy grace and daring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She saw him ride around boulders over</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the other riders leaped their horses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly two riders broke from the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancing line and raced into the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon. The other riders swung to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to intercept her, should she attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dash into the adjoining canon. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">were plainly hostile tactics. Surely Norn</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not order his men to surround her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply to guide her to the ranch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked about her desperately, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then sent her horse into a plunging gallop</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the ridge. The crack of a rifle slapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silence of the canon, and the whine of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning bullet made her gasp and abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt. She could hear the shouts and curses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her pursuers as they struck the foot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge. She was trapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      AS THE pinto carried him into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert, the gambler groped through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mental fog for some plan that, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly set in action, would remove King</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn from the world, and leave Chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy free to follow his desires. But, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">variably, every thoughr-trail led back to tht</seg><seg type="columnLine">one impregnable fact, the killing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apache Kid and the method thereof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn's use of Sunshine as a diversion from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main attack proved him a thinker; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gambler, primitive, led by emotions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealing only with ignorant men, inwardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">cringed at the thought of meeting a gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">master who possessed not only a superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, but a mind to plan, to peer into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future, to make deductions. And that</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting, if he remained in the Hemper</seg><seg type="columnLine">territory, was inevitable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For hours, he bitterly recalled, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the Kid, hungering for the gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter's life. Many times, with compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive safety, he might have emptied the shot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun into the killer's body, but had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">held back by a nameless dread. Enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">then King Norn, the thinker, to destroy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid with a little plan. At that inevitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting might not the thinker once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">put forth a little plan of which the kernel</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereof was death for Chance Hardy?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And back of it all was the woman. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thick-headed fool he had been not to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that King Norn had been his principal rival</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the day of the girl's arrival in Hemper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inwardly he writhed as he realised how</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn had permitted him to clear away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human trash around the woman. Norn</seg><seg type="columnLine">had watched him intimidate the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">preacher, the doctor, the men who shrank</seg><seg type="columnLine">back from danger, the weaklings, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riff-raff of the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men like Bundy and Brown, requiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">special treatment, had been honored with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn's personal attention. The man dealt</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only in little plans, but in great plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up of many little plans. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing of Billy Snake was a plan that</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned all men that those who rested in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of King Norn's friendship held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to call on his heart's blood for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And back of it all was the woman. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler possessed the imagination that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooted in emotion and desire, and he vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned her warm, glowing beauty. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">before her rose an ominous figure, alert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible, and with an eye reflecting lightning</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Norn," he muttered, bending low over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle horn. "Norn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman seats herself in a luxurious</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and looks out on the world of men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In her face is a maddening, unfathomable</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery. An indifferent smile plays about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her scarlet lips, and in her eyes dwells a lure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that draws eager fools to their doom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bundy, with his drunken leer, swaggers</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and the ominous, terrible figure trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms him into a battered, bloody, cowering</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretch. Brown, the soft and fat, mouthing</seg><seg type="columnLine">large words, approaches with airy gallantry</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to be transformed into a sodden thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">bawling for water. Other men fall back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the shadow. Then the Apache Kid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the killer of twenty, presses forward, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a flash, becomes an inert piece of clay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then many men fall back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow. Now another presses forward--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chance Hardy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ominous, terrible figure seems to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject from his eyes two fine wires that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge in the heart of Chance Hardy. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns flash, and two bullets follow the fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires into the heart. It is finished. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominous, terrible figure turns and extends a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to the girl. - She rises and gives him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile of sweet surrender, and slowly they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fade, fade, fade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gambler cursed and jerked himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into reality. He now plainly saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was only one course left for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow, and that led to Pete and his men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under whose protection a campaign against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rancher might be safely planned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn's actions indicated that he had either</seg><seg type="columnLine">foiled an attempt to capture the boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or knew that the gang now held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn, doubtless, was trailing him now, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rancher was conceded to be a wizard</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the desert. Hardy hauled the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle from its scabbard, pulled in the pinto,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and listened. Suddenly he noted an omi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nous glare in the sky over Hemper. Fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The town was burning. His saloon would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be destroyed. The old safe would probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">be looted as soon as it cooled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The glare increased in intensity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted higher. The gambler groaned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The town was doomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_ Then he realized that he was wasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Norn would not let the burning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hemper swerve him from his course. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rancher knew the desert intimately, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail, every cut-off, every water-hole. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must not think of returning to town;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn would surely ambush him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though the gambler was a town man, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was familiar with the camps of the gang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew that Twenty-eight Palms was</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer to the Norn ranch than the Witch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk camp, and that the gang would, in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability, choose the former camp for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their headquarters while lurking about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn ranch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed the ranch road until the loom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Rain-maker warned him that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearing the north side of the basin. Turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the road, he cut across country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Progress now was slow. His had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft life, and he found it difficult to hold his</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage in that gray waste. He entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Wash, and was forced to ride far to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south before he could find an exit from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, sunken way. The sun was above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon before he glimpsed Twenty-eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete snatched up a pair of battered field-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Holy smoke," he ejaculated, "it's Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridin' Norn's painted hawse!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy, as he approached the camp, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to withhold nothing from the gang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was riding Norn's horse and they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">demand an explanation. He woidd put</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on the defensive, convince them their</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety lay in unity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he dismounted beneath the palms the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rovers gathered about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You didn't get the boy, I see," observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gambler, with a dark glance at Pete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet," that worthy returned optim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istically, "but we'll pick him up in a day or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. But what you doin' with Norn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawse?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Norn killed the Apache Kid in my place</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night. The Kid took a ring from Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wayne, and Norn come in and put up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">play against Sunshine, and then beefed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid. Then he throws his guns on me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleans me, and then takes me over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel. There I broke away, jumped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinto, and here I be. You bungled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal somewhere, Pete. Norn must know</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're after the boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Pete and his men were not impressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the accusation with which Hardy finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">his account. They considered only the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact of Norn having killed the Apache Kid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy's importance, his power, his ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reward shrank to proportions pitifully</seg><seg type="columnLine">small and insignificant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete, the far-sighted, voiced the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentiment when he grumbled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You sure have fixed your own funeral.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paws off for me, if Norn's on your trail."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with a calculating look. "Bring any</seg><seg type="columnLine">money with you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why, no," faltered Hardy. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">could I?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right," mused Pete dryly. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't gather it on the run."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE gambler flushed darkly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insult, and forced a smile that failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deceive even the dullest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rovers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pete hooked his thumbs in his belt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">insolently looked the gambler up and down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now that we've bungled the game, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you say, what's your next move? If Norn</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows we're after the boy, he hain't likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave him hangin' on a tree for us. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances are he took him to town with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and got him hid away safe. And by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he's in the desert with a bunch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I don't think that," Hardy soothed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I looked back and the sky was all lit up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looked like the town was burnin'. If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, Norn couldn't get men to leave-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, then," Pete cut in quickly, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">means your place is gone. You won't be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape to deliver the money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes, I will," the gambler hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured him. "I've got it in a Los Angeles</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what you say," muttered Pete;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew back to confer with his men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gambler shivered inwardly as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted that he was debarred from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">council. They were treating him as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would an outsider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Pete returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The boys don't jes' like this deal as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands now," he said slowly. "At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">start they was willin' to take your word, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now they want to see the color of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">money before they go ahead. They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinkin' of old man Norn and the old bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wiped out. They was willin' enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick up the boy and hold him for you, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they don't want open war with King Norn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you want any kind of action now, you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better slip into town and drag back some</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinero. The sight of real money might stir</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boys up a little."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Pete's attitude was a thinly-veiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">insolence. Hardy, to the raw-boned desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">rover, was now "a has-been" who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken cover like a coyote. Pete knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">money alone could not hold a man erect in</seg><seg type="columnLine">t lie desert country; to survive, he must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power to chill the hearts of men with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear. Removed from his saloon, with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering display of bottles, its roulette-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel and faro lay-out, the gambler seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an insignificant man. Certainly, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">white hands and soft body, he was unfit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cope with the bronzed, lean desert rovers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had ruled them, Pete now saw, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">their desires, and not through any natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of character. Whisky and gam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling had been the sources of his power.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had done nothing, suffered no hardships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet he had used them to gather money for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. They had been the peons and he_the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lordly Don.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dominant qualities that Pete,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thcough policy, had held under cover now</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang up, virile, hard, and not to be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nied. Contemptuously he regarded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had once ruled him, sneering a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle at the fine boots, the white vest, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazzling watch-chain. A few days in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert, and the fine boots would be in tat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters, the white vest soiled and greasy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smooth hands blistered and sore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lower and yet lower sank the gambler in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete's estimation. By long rides, by sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and toil, he, and his sort, had kept Hardy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands white, and had made it possible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to wear fine clothes and sport dazzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch-chains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even now Hardy was attempting to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to secure a woman. Why serve him</seg><seg type="columnLine">further? Since Norn had stripped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask from his face, the card-sharp was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tp be feared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardy, in a desperate effort to regain his</seg><seg type="columnLine">prestige, sought to address the gang, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete viciously checked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't start no talk with the bunch,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned the lean leader, the muscles around</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes twitching. "If you got anything to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, say it to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Curbing his rage as best he could, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler forced himself to speak in regretful</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pete, I've been on the square. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you all. I might have come out here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kept a lot of stuff under cover, but I laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">every card on the table. Do you think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the way to treat a man who plays a square</seg><seg type="columnLine">game with you? You agreed to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, take so much money and ask no ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. I didn't think, and I don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, that you or any of the boys would</seg><seg type="columnLine">kick out on the given word."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little earnest speech impressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang. Even Pete was moved by it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I could have said," Hardy went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that Norn loaned me his pinto, but J</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't; I told you the facts. He got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">drop on me, but that don't mean he is goin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run me out of this country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he turned to the gang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there a man among you that ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to me for a dollar or any kind of help</seg><seg type="columnLine">and didn't get it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The answer was a chorus of negative</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then to Pete:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's get the boy now. He's the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">card. When you hold him, Norn can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do a thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why can't he?" Pete sharply ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned. "What's to hinder him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He wouldn't want the kid hurt," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gambler said smoothly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe so," Pete grumbled doubtfully;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and squinted up at the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'd better be movin'," Hardy meekly</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested.

A quick pressure of the trig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger, and the second rider clawed at his sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle horn, lost control of his horse, recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, and finally turned and galloped in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">erratic course from the canon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn ran down the canon, shouting the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's name, and halted a few yards beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's Norn," he called; and beckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperatively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She hesitated to dare the steep slope, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, with a quick intake of breath, whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">her horse and urged him down the decliv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had taken Dickie into the desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills was playing a lone hand. Bitten by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rattler, he had been forced to seek the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch. The boy was safe and unhurt. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaved a sigh of relief. The gang had</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to capture the boy.

Six men to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and his father had, with the support</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two cowboys, wiped out a baker's dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old gang. If they attacked the tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel before dark, he was confident he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">give them each such a hot reception that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">survivors would give up the fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If they attempted a night attack, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have much in his favor. Coming in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the gray gloom into the pitch-dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel, they would, for several vital sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds, be at a disadvantage. He could prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably empty the magazine of his repeater</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it became necessary to leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter of the angle, and, for the girl's sake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry the fight to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If they merely besieged the tunnel, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would creep out before daylight, and gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelter of the rocky crest above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel. From that point, with the coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of daylight, he would make the stakes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death so high that his enemies would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to get out of the game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he thought of Hardy, and abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">queried--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you see a man on a spotted horse?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," she answered, and the rancher</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled approval of her calm even tones.

The man with the red furrow across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brows, whirled and stumbled blindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tunnel, bawling for help.

Now the gambler pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trigger and the bullet grazed the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rancher's head. Norn pitched against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of the tunnel and sank to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pete, his vitals torn with lead, turned as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy fired.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimming faculties groped for the cause of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rifle blast to his ear. Norn--yes, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn--was dying. Only Hardy was left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Hardy blocked some insistent desire--</seg><seg type="columnLine">some all-important attainment. A picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a dark-haired, violet-eyed woman flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the inner eyes of the rover. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient primitive desire blazed up--she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was within his grasp--one more heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenching effort and he would be alone--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her. Swaying and grinning the death-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin, he fired from the hip at the gambler.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a breath Hardy stared at him blankly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then suddenly slumped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All down--all down," mumbled Pete,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs spraddling uncouthly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly he turned to look down at Norn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE rancher, clawing, falling, strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling on the slippery slope of agony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought his way back to conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.

Then suddenly he collapsed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched forward on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn was now crawling from the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tunnel.

For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he stared at the litter of dead men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then toppled forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Silence.

Doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gruff and grizzled being, guiding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses through the gray gloom, was right--</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing that she could do. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a responsibility, a burden. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been wickedly selfish. To rid her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self of worry, she had foolishily ridden into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert, against the repeated warnings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her uncle.

She could not then bring herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to question the grim, forbidding old foreman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, while friendly enough with her uncle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed intent on avoiding all contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even Uncle Charlie offered little or no</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort.

Thereafter, the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had refrained from any reference to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battle, contenting himself with giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">her brief excerpts from Jack's reports con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerning Norn's condition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl, sad and introspective, took to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the desert road.

Could he</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, with safety, tell her that he loved her?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been convinced from the first that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who threw himself at her feet could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hope to meet with favor, much less love.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To prize love, she must be made to seek it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suffer in the quest. He had suffered--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">puckered scars on his body attested that--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she, too, must learn that love, despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poets, treads no primrose path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course she admired him, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtless grateful, but he did not want ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration or gratitude, nor caresses born of</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement. What he desired was love,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprompted by anything save his natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to attract and to hold it. The smit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten yokel might pursue the maid of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice, but he, King Norn, would trust to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction. If attraction failed, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not murmur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, Love required certain little ameni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties. Perhaps a letter--a cheerful humor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous letter--to her would bring a welcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply. And he might have Desert Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">take her some roses. Surely such a gift</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not place him in the category of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantic egotists she had so calmly rebuffed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unaware of Desert Jack's brusk treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the girl, he presumed she under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood that, in sending her back to town, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thought had been for her comfort and</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety. He did not know that the old fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had, largely by avoiding the girl, sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to convince her that Norn was glad to sever</seg><seg type="columnLine">an acquaintance that had brought nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but danger and suffering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Desert Jack came up to the porch, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather shamefacedly, gave Norn a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">bouquet of wild asters he had gathered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his return from town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norn's eyes brightened at the old fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low's thoughtfulness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thought you might like 'em," Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, somewhat sheepishly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You old scamp," Norn exclaimed affec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionately; and laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack dodged playfully and seated himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the young man's feet.

I told him that wimmin, as a gen'ral</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule, were more responsibility than they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth. She was in the office and heard me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She come out and says she, 'Mr. Jack, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry if I've been a burden to any one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can convey my regrets to Mr. Norn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bid him farewell for me.' Them's her</seg><seg type="columnLine">very words, and, I'm bound to admit, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way she said 'em made me duck and dodge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Charlie seemed all rattled and shuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. He tells me, on the side, every time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">opens his mouth he puts his foot in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guess I got the same habit.

Sharply imperative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The old man dodged. Norn gave him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long somber look. Then the rancher, rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly, dropped the flowers in his chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and paced the length of the porch and back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How's my gait?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady enough," admitted the puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do I look?" _</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so bad.

"If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it easy and don't over-do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then get Spot and my best saddle."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This with suppressed excitement that added</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the foreman's puzzlement.

"Can't she</seg><seg type="columnLine">see he wants to get shut of her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carefully he curried and saddled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spotted horse. The animal had had a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest, and, as Jack led him up to the porch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave vent to his spirits by little pranc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and playful nips at the foreman's arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To Norn he nickered a soft welcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ho-ho, old boy," laughed the rancher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm glad to see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pressed his cheek against the velvety</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle. He mounted and settled himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the saddle. What a joy it was to feel a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse between his knees again, to look up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sky instead of a ceiling, to recover</seg><seg type="columnLine">health and strength. Wonderful world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sunshine of gladness flooded his soul.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He leaned from the saddle and gripped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man's shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told John to put the flowers you</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought in water. And, Jack, forget what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said--about you talking too much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good-by."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Desert Jack looked after the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">held all the affection of his cynical old</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Same as he was when a boy," he softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">soliloquized. "Sorry the moment he hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">your feelin's--ready to say he was wrong."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn cantered down the Hemper road</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious that all his line of calm reasoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">had crumpled before the sweeping assault</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one fact--she was going away. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now no time for further experiments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Love, he now humbly admitted, could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be reduced to a scientific basis. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed sufficient strength to either coax</seg><seg type="columnLine">or coerce love. Even the circle of danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which he had surrounded her was a web</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gauze to stay the coming or the going of</seg><seg type="columnLine">love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What man, worthy of love, would pause</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any circle of danger though it were woven</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fires of hell? Bah, he had done too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much thinking. Love was heedless of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts or words, or even deeds, delight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in upsetting all the calculations of man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in nullifying his most carefully-planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">actions, in snapping rosy fingers under the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nose of the philosopher, in refuting all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">has ever been said or written since man rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the primeval slime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite his claims of dominance, his per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fervid announcements of superiority, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager acceptance of the empty title of pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suer, man, when it came to love, was, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to woman, a conceited numbskull, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">passer of bouquets to self, a half-wit fumb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling with the dynamite of destiny. Woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">love's trusted agent, enjoyed plenipoten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiary powers rightly denied blundering man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was versed in love's secret diplomacy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she knew, long, long before the. self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined dominant one awoke from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance of egotism, the winning moves in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About all a man could do was to tell her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he loved her--a fact, no doubt, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she was well aware from the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their first meeting. He, King Norn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranked not one notch above one of his cow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys riding to learn his fate from the lips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some giggling girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To plan, to think, to do anything save to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell her that he loved her was futile. If she</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled, heaven would be his; if she was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsive, he could only return to the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert and suffer--and somehow survive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly weariness overwhelmed him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt sick and faint. He was not as strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had supposed. She must not see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn and faint. He longed to see her, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride insisted on an appearance of strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would rest a little, and then, as of yore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dash into town. Dismounting, he noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the movement jarred him. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched out by the roadside, he drew a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep breath of the perfumed air, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">relaxed. Nature, working unceasingly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">restore energy, whispered to him--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sleep, sleep, sleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just a few moments of blessed repose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would press on to learn his fate. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kindly mothering desert had a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan. Soothed by the murmurous voices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring, warmed by the friendly sun, he fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      DORA, after her epistolary failures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brooded for a few days, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then had resolved to make what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered a final desperate move. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">would, at the first opportunity, get word to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn that she had decided to return to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eastern home. If the man cared, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bestir himself; if he was indifferent, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Survivor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could find some surcease from pain in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thronging city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Calmly she informed Uncle Charlie of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision. He plumped down in his chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly wrecking it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My Gawd, Dora, you don't mean it," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheezed. "What'll I do? I'll be so lone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some, I'll want to die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A grampus sigh, and then meekly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I s'pose this town holds nothin' for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you.

"Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time next week--maybe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe?" echoed Uncle Charlie, clutch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at straws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded brightly, and left him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day fortune favored her plan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Desert Jack, as related, became an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">witting Cupid. She watched the foreman</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive down the desert road. Norn, now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtless, able to ride, would have time</seg><seg type="columnLine">after Desert Jack arrived at the ranch to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride to town before dark. Surely--if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared--he would come. It was just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance; and she shivered with nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reading was a bore, there was no solace</seg><seg type="columnLine">in music, even Dickie oppressed her. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norn started Hemperward--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought made her heart leap--she might</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride out and meet him--accidently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danger? She snapped her fingers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed her head proudly. She had met Dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger face to face, and had not whimpered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, though she did not name it, she now</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that Norn's spirit walked before her</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a lictor walks before royalty. No more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had not failed to note, was she greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bland, insinuating smiles. The men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert now ventured naught but brief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">respectful salutations, seemingly intent on</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing her as quickly as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hurriedly she donned her riding-habit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was soon galloping down the desert road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When she came to the ranch road, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted to debate what seemed to her a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentous question. Should she ride on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boldly and meet him, or should she turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and permit him to overtake her?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deliberately she refused to contemplate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability of disappointment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She became conscious of faint, plaintive</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries drifting down from the void above her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She looked up and smiled at a long V of wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">geese moving steadily northward. No hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man bickering for them, no false pride, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">evasiveness. Their sure, swift flight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">their answer to the ancient call. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerved slightly, and she lost them in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow of the sinking sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she was thrilled with wild re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellion against every tiling that kept her</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the man she loved. What folly it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to quibble with Fate, to exact conditions, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to the solemn pratings of pride. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go to him--now. Even to the ranch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned her horse into the ranch road,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she saw the spotted horse, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prostrate figure in the sand, her heart almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped beating.

It would be difficult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn him into a society man again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved adventure, untamed lands, tropic</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas, strange people, and the big, vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams of the wanderer. Had he the soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a beach-comber, after all?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, he bad to admit, was the life that</seg><seg type="columnLine">suited him, and though his financial position</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not exactly rosy, he was in excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">health and spirits. His lugger was not yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully paid up, and he was depending on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">haul to clear himself; but he was a born</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventurer, undaunted by circumstances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buoyed up by the hopes of youth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ted reveled in the pearling. His lugger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted up with a dingey, pump, and diving-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gear, had a small but resourceful crew. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was proud of Utimaro, a little Jap, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the most daring divers of Torres</seg><seg type="columnLine">Straits. Though slightly built, Utimaro</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strong and sinewy, and there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">question of his skill and courage. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely cold-blooded, and if the prospects</seg><seg type="columnLine">were good, there was no risk he would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuse to take. He was a silent little man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more respected than loved by the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew. Why he had offered him his services</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a moderate wage was a mystery to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jarrett.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Besides Utimaro there was another Jap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sato, the "tender," whose job it was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer the diver's signals, and keep the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pipes and ropes free while he was under</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Malays kept the pumps going,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the fifth man, a Levantine Greek,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was no diver, acted as cook and general</seg><seg type="columnLine">handy man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The divers had struck a good patch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell. Utimaro returned from the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea with his bag filled, and sat for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment enjoying the fresh breeze. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Malays then stepped into the diving-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress and was lowered down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ted had admired the diving of Utimaro,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes still followed the little man, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">went aft to the pile of shells. He noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jap had a piece of wire which he slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away quickly as Ted crossed over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that, Utimaro?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Jap looked up with a scowl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the game?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Jap did not reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ted looked at the shells, and found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">some had been stacked on edge in the sun, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the oyster would open easily, and allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big pearl to be fished for with a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire. This was a favorite device with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored divers, who have a good eye for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oyster likely to contain a pearl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That'll do, Utimaro," said Ted, "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the rest myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he knew why Utimaro had been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to work for him. Ted was a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">man at the game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Utimaro!" called one of the Malays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was again the Jap's turn to dive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Utimaro looked over the ship's side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Too deep," he muttered at last, "it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the law."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There is a law against diving below a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain depth; but Utimaro had never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to refuse before. His obvious in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention was to pay Jarrett back for discover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his tampering with the shells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is your last chance, Utimaro. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you quit now, you'll have to find another</seg><seg type="columnLine">job." But the Jap would not dive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shell was so good, that Ted Jarrett</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined on going down himself. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">full confidence in his crew, and knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malays would keep an eye on Utimaro.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he got into the dress, and the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet was screwed on, he felt far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable. His cars buzzed; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a loud bang, caused by the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed air striking his ear-drums. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ted, who had no thought of consequences,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to see it through. He stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the ladder attached to the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, and then cast himself off. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the bottom by the plumper which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with the life-line, was held by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent Japanese bender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached the floor of the ocean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ted was dazzled by the enchantment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene, that looked as beautiful and unreal</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a fairy palace. He saw the most ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quisite shells, of every shape and color,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees made out of coral, delicate fishes flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing among the marine growths, curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers and ferns of the sea. But he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to indulge his sense of wonder. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his eyes fixed on one object only--shell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Overhead the lugger drifted, dragging him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, and quickly he gathered the large oys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters, and dropped them into his bag. Uti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maro was right, they had certainly struck a</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch. Ted filled his bag, gave the signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be hauled up, and rose quickly to the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Sato unscrewed the helmet; and Ted</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down exhausted, eagerly filling his lungs</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fresh air. Utimaro did not speak;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the Malays grinned, for the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">American's grit bad impressed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ted gave the word to return home, lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">back exhausted on the deck, and lit his pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lugger danced over the waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a day for dreams. In the drowsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropic afternoon the scene was a picture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight, with the burning blue of the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sky, the red beach at the foot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs, and the white roofs of the houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">peeping amid the vivid green foliage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coconut, poinciana, and the palm trees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The air was warm, but a light breeze blew</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ted sat up. For some weeks luck had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone against him. There was not a pearl in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every shell, Ted soon discovered, nor in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every hundred shells. It was a gamble, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lure was irresistible. Now he had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered Utimaro's trick, his prospects</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed brighter. At any moment a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">might make a fortune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a flat, thin-bladed knife, he started</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the shells he had just dived for himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The opening of every oyster was an exciting</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly he opened shell after shell, put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting any gems he found into a little tin box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had suffered many disappointments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first he thought that every oyster con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained a pearl of some kind, and he mistook</seg><seg type="columnLine">every bright bubble for one. Often he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it was real till the knife proved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">error--the bubble burst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little box was half-filled with pearls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly baroques, ill-shaped gems of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratively small value, yet serving to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage the hope that the rare pearl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evelyn's pearl, might yet be found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he opened shell after shell, finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a bubble or a baroque, he would just</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse, and tackle another pile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better luck next time," he would say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the lugger was nearing the shore, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up a big oyster, inserted his knife at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "lip" of the shell, and cut through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong central muscle that bound the flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and round sides together. His knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched something that made his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">jump with excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a beautiful pearl. It was big, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly round, with a smooth skin and deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate iridescent luster. Ted could hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe his eyes, for never Ijefore had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen anything like it. There was no pearl</seg><seg type="columnLine">to match it in the gem-shops of Thursday</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island. What was the worth of that little</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere of nacre? Ted examined it care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. Who could say? A fine pearl is like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fine picture, it is something unique, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond price, it becomes a matter of fancy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of artistic taste. Well, if it were sold for</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty, twenty-five, thirty thousand dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars, Ted thought it would be cheap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he had no intention of selling this</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearl. He had worked for it, he had crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world to find it, he had dived for it him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and he felt proud of his efforts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Utimaro stood unobserved 1x2hind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Ted looked up the Jap was point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the little jetty the lugger was ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At last," Ted reflected, "I have some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to show, a perfect pearl, a queen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gems, worthy to hang as a pendant on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white throat of a New York beauty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lugger touched the jetty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ted hid the pearl in his belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I NEXT evening as the moon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising, Ted Jarrett stepped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his shack, and ran down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach for a swim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told nobody of the precious pearl he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found, and he thought nobody knew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before going down to the sea, he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully 'round the shack, and slipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little leather bag, containing the pearl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a hole in the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he was enjoying liis swim, Sato, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japanese tender approached, and, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Pearl of Torres</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ted came out of the water, banded him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">note. It came from New York, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized Evelyn's handwriting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he hastily dressed he was surprised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find how slightly moved he was. New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, was very far away, and somehow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights of Broadway were less alluring than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moonlight on the lonely sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tore open the letter, glanced at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily, and was about to return when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sato, who had been waiting patiently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him a question about the lugger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While he was reading the letter from New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, and giving Sato some directions for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next day, a small brown figure, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been hiding behind the low bushes at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foot of the cliff, crept into the shack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Utimaro. He went straight to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole in the wall, opened the bag, and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the pearl, and then glided off into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes like a snake into its hole. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wriggled along the sands till he reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff, scrambled up the jagged rocks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dismissing Sato, Jarrett, with the letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand, returtied slowly and thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully to the shack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw himself into a low chair, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the kettle was lx&gt;iling, he again read</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evelyn's brief note. It destroyed his last</seg><seg type="columnLine">illusions about her. She took it for granted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was a failure as usual, and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never make a success of pearling. Shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen a hundred dollars a ton--she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made inquiries. She would be pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a pearl from Torres, if it were a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">one; but fine pearls were rare, and fortune</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not likely to favor him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her light chatter of automobiles, dances</seg><seg type="columnLine">and supper parties, and the artificial plea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sures that could be bought by wealth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jarred on the young man, who saw clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was more interested in Ms fortune</seg><seg type="columnLine">than in himself. The pearl he had striven</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, surely it was never destined for such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and calculating woman!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As he sat, dreaming for hours in the tropic</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, he realized how strangely satisfied he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was with his lot. He liked the life, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motley, adventurous crowd that gathered o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights in the little shanty. Suzette, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was treated by the pearlers with a rough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but genuine courtesy, seemed to take no</seg><seg type="columnLine">special notice of him. After the incident</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Rod, he felt rather shy in her presence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping somewhat aloof, with a chivalrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">care not to presume on her gratitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He often wondered at her refinement, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he learned that she was the daughter of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultured man, though a ne'er-do-well, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">French engineer, who had traveled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world seeking his fortune, and at last come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Thursday Island. Later he crossed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cape York, and opened the little hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though most of his time he spent pearling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One night his lugger went out, but it never</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned. That was two years ago. Su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zette kept on the shanty, saving her little</seg><seg type="columnLine">money, so that she could return to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother's people in San Francisco.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She was quite unlike the selfish, super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial Evelyn. She had known suffering;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was part of her charm. The diamond</seg><seg type="columnLine">is struck from the hard inanimate rock, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pearl is born of pain--that was the dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference between them. The New York girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hard, cold, brilliant, a society beauty--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a diamond; Suzette was soft and subtle, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had known suffering, but with a depth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of color, a delicate enchantment--a pearl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, a pearl," he reflected, "the pearl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Torres."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS a quiet time in the Cape</seg><seg type="columnLine">York Hotel. Suzette was sitting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rocking-chair, pensively knitting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Leon Rod came in. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly excited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wine, Suzette," he cried, "I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suzette rose, and brought a small bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of champagne. The wine sparkled gaily in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass. As he lifted it to his lips, be</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed boldly at Suzette, who flushed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Leon Rod laughed, drained his glass, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">called for more wine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I have good news," he said, "good news,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cherie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Suzette brought another bottle he</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned across the table and spoke eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen! At last fortune lias been kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. I am going to leave this infernal</seg><seg type="columnLine">country.

Bah! It's a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. But I'm through with it, do you hear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suzette? I have my fortune, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suzette watched him closely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have been buying pearls?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mais oui.

The man, who was creeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the beach below, by a familiar gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed himself to Jarrett as the diver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Utimaro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was before a cave in the rocks that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Utimaro stopped, and looked 'round.

Rod talked volubly, offering a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">price; but the face of the Jap was set and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It will not do," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But let me explain, Utimaro-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"No explanation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Rod held up the pearl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It is big, and has a good skin, that I ad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mit--but it is not perfect.

Rod started as Jarrett met him face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What do you want?" he cried angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"My pearl," said Jarrett.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Rod, who though slower in movement was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the heavier man, closed with him, and to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gether they swayed backward and forward,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">each trying in vain for a successful throw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At last Jarrett broke away, and met his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">opponent's rush with a straight left.

He did not go again that</seg><seg type="columnLine">season. For four years he had stuck to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the post, wearing his soul threadbare. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was weary of it all, weary unto death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On first coming to the country he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildly interested in the practices and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beliefs of the Indians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> White Hair--so called because of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">streak of grayish-white hair through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of his scalp-lock--was more astute</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the average savage, but Clay, ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stemious by nature, quickly sickened of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his drunken orgies with Murty. He in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly derided as the priests proclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supreme power of Tirawa. His mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though tainted, retained its New England</seg><seg type="columnLine">poise. It returned to the old order of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought more insistently as the years</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed.

Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pagan beliefs found a quick response in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crude mind. He combined the credulity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the child and the ferocity of the brute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His first serious quarrel with Clay resulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the latter's contemptuous comments</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a Nahurac lodge--a place where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pawnee believed animals met to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">councils: Murty firmly believed White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hair's old father had been placed under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the protection and tutelage of bears when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a child, which accounted for certain alleged</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear traits in his old age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clay ridiculed such notions and absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing from his savage environment except</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trick of throwing a sprig of cedar on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fife when the tempest scoured the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Arkansas.

He hated the somber wood, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptiness of the river, the earth lodge</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him.

There was never a minute when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were together that Murty was on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard. And it was such a simple expedient!</seg><seg type="columnLine">For five minutes the potentials of the homi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cide braced him up and gave him an air of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity as he pictured himself the master</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own fate. Murty stood between him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a return home, but Murty could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminated at any time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An inner voice taunted--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how would you get away after kill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His vision of freedom flew to pieces. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill Murty would bring the whole Pawnee</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation down on him.

Clay whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My hide wouldn't be safe a second after</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's wiped out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, the notion of Murty's taking-</seg><seg type="columnLine">off had found root in his mind and grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">sturdily, even if, like a weed, it grew pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poselessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there evolved from his fear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate another conviction: some time Murty</seg><seg type="columnLine">would decide to move on, and when he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would take all the furs. To avoid any</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispute with his partner he would kill him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, siree!

Could Clay</seg><seg type="columnLine">have looked ahead fourteen years, as he rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the wild trail, he would have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">General Kearney leading his troops along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river path on his way to Santa Fe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Keamey was to find the region as</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsettled and primitive as had the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quistador. The West stood unchanged for</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries, awaiting the white man's roads</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shatter the savage fastnesses and pave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way for plow and homestead. Clay</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have scorned such a suggestion. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed the West must continue barbarous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and repelling for further centuries; vast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">un tameable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He passed well-known bluffs and woods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grassy intervals thickly dotted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitening buffalo skulls, only now he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensing danger where before he had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">only monotony and heart-sickness. So long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had considered Murty a protection</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the fickle savages he had spleneti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally condemned the country, but had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared.

It was a familiar sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed hundreds of times before; now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it took on a new significance and seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to picture his own position. He was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless as one of the calves did the wolves</seg><seg type="columnLine">once get it alone. He jumped from con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion to conclusion till he convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself Murty had planned his death from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning of their partnership.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He recalled the man's reticence to discuss</seg><seg type="columnLine">former trading ventures; nor could he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember he ever had mentioned a partner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet, when in a genial mood, Murty</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequently declared that the ideal com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bination was a man like himself to mix</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Indians and win their good-will,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with another, like Joey Clay, to stick at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trading-post and keep the accounts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'll do for me, sure's lightning,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered Clay.

Murty talked garrulously</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his absence and took pains to dwell</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the fact he had been at the Pawnee</seg><seg type="columnLine">village all the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hoping to induce him to betray himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some way Clay took the water pails</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went toward the river.

Finally he rose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fierce eyes ranging the surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover suspiciously for a moment. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ran swiftly toward the post. Clay</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew his life hung in the balance should</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murty continue on to the river and find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the abandoned pails, but there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">resisting the shivery curiosity alternately</seg><seg type="columnLine">freezing and burning his blood. He crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rock and thrust his arm and hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a deep cleft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pulled forth a cross made of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">beads, several finger-rings of gold and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">handful of gold coins.

The framework of his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed fairly sound and his eyes held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred sort of intelligence, so Riley signed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on and hoped for the best. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">called himself "Whisky" Bill, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shunted into the forecastle, into the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany of men scarce better than he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before this Riley had signed on a tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark-haired, silent nondescript with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky-blue eyes found in visionaries, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">querors and fanatics, and a part of a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger gone. He acquired the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Big Frank." The man's face and bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed dull and listless, even mournful;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Riley began to note otherwise on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second day out, when it was brought home</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him forcibly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The crew kicks about the grub already,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned First Mate Blazon, a swarthy, lazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">product of the Florida Keys. "Watch that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Frank. He leads them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the shtart of the voyage, eh?

And the master shook</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">anguished fists in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, in his bare cabin, Riley thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">things over. He pitied these men and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned to be an easy master. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">born to be friends with humankind, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now he resolved to exact the strictest kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of discipline. The food was enough to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">any crew restive. There must be no slack</seg><seg type="columnLine">master on top of that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Furthermore, the ship might be filthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Riley w'ould not be. He understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">the influence of a spruce, clean-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer, so the vessel saw him thereafter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his old natty master's uniform with only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insignia of his former line taken off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On that slattern schooner the trim mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chant-marine skipper seemed incongruous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had himself to please.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Riley had no doubts about the loyalty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the easy-going Blazon or his second-mate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Swede named Larsen, but he saw they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to toe the mark also, otherwise the</seg><seg type="columnLine">master would have to impose his discipline</seg><seg type="columnLine">single-handed, fie resolved to give them</seg><seg type="columnLine">an object lesson at the first opportunity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus on the fifth day, when a scowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greek at the mainmast obeyed the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate's orders sluggishly, Riley was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared. He leaped off the poop and grabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man by the back of the neck while</seg><seg type="columnLine">noting that two other members of the crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">were watching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What d'ye mean by that?" he bawled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When you get an ordher you'll jumpl"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he shook the other till his teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">chattered. "Now," continued the wrath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful master, "you'll have a little dhrill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see that cordage coiled along the deck?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll coil and uncoil it for one hour.

Now shtart!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the corner of his eye Riley noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a giant form loafing almost behind turn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled about suddenly. It was Big Frank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" snapped the master, stiffening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other looked embarrassed and Riley</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed toward the forecastle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go forward, you!" he roared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other hesitated a fraction of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second but at the first twitch of the peppery</seg><seg type="columnLine">master's muscles he shuffled toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forecastle and Riley mounted the poop</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. The mate had quietly taken in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">io6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scene and smiled at him, but Riley was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that mood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mishter Blazong," said the master,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointedly, "the next time you're not</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed inshtantly, take action!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was goin' to start," protested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate, "but you went too fast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't let any one beat you!" snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riley. "We've got to choke off throuble</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it shtarts, with this crowd. If there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a man among 'em I'd praise the saints,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they're too cheap! That Big Frank is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only one with muscles and if he shtarts</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything, get him quick. Them's ordhers!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without further words Riley went to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dingy cabin, thinking of the sordid owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">who sent this foul old hulk to sea without</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity for those aboard and wishing he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked the fat scoundrel when he had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. Sitting down to his tasteless meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of suspicious canned beef and ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">potatoes and brackish bread, Riley longed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the choking still more. Back in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness he wondered what he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">do after he turned liis cargo over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russians. Another trip on a Slemm ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unthinkable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT the next four weeks went by</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, with the crew sullen but</seg><seg type="columnLine">outwardly falling in with Riley's</seg><seg type="columnLine">taut discipline and the old dynamite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner slatting and groaning westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and northward across the seas, rolling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles behind her. Then came a storm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mistrusting his ship, Riley stood by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmsman and was drenched and battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hours by whipping spindrift while</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarling seas leaped over the low bulwarks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swept the deck a hundred times. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm subsided forty hours after it</seg><seg type="columnLine">started and the wind swung from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north in a steady blow, the tired master</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into his bunk and let the big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular waves rock him .to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Riley awoke suddenly in his dark bunk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A yell and the sounds of rushing feet on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck apprized him that something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amiss. Jumping out of his bunk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">donning trousers, Riley sensed it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">early morning--before dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The agitated clatter of feet outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased. Voices shouted frantically. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poop above Riley something heavy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being hauled along the deck to port. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded like a boat being swung from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">davits. A sharp voice boomed from above,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">then footsteps thundered down the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">companionway while the half-clad Riley</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed a pistol from a holster and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">till a near-by voice howled to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jump for your life!" shrieked the voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It belonged to Blazon, the mate. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship is afire forward!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's sea-boots clattered upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">again desperately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Riley's heart clutched and his hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingled at the instant of imagination that</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictured what would happen when the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">spark struck that cargo. Panic seized him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but only for a moment. The next instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rushed to the deck, pistol in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forward, a tiny glare showed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass of the closed hatch above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forecastle--a sinister flicker of light just</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright enough to throw the panting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking men into shadow as they surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the poop and labored madly to cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">overside the bulky small boat. The mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">was directing savagely with fists and curses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The quivering second mate was working</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the stubborn falls. The prow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small boat was swung outward, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting the heavy seas that leaped toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck, and near that prow spoke a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimpering voice, chattering with terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">and repealing its phrase automatically--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He turned the lamp over--he turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp over!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Riley's eye took in the scene in an instant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He glanced toward the wheel, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmsman had left to join in the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic. Then Riley glanced forward. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow-red light seemed a little larger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And dynamite only a few inches away!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cool dawn-wind was soughing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rigging, laying the ship far over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">port and whistling about the hatch above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forecastle where only a flimsy floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood between the flames and the cargo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Above, the stars were beginning to pale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Far to the north but within easy small-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat distance stretched the many islands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Aleutian group, like stepping-stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Alaska to the Orient. Alongside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old schooner the sea was running high and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel was quartering the giant waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and just beginning to broach as it felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of the helmsman's hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the flash that the practised eye of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riley noted all these things his mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up. He raised the pistol and strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the mob, firing into the air. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">report half-paralyzed some of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On Short Allowance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Off from that boat!" roared Riley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get away!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant the men hesitated and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">master leveled the pistol toward the mass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go forward, somebody!" he roared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get forward and open that hatch--quick!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man near the small boat's prow</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed away from it and seemed undecided;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but another man claimed the master's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" shrieked Larsen, the cowering</seg><seg type="columnLine">second mate. "Are you mad? It iss</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder! No!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the faint glow of the dawn the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was grimacing and his voice whinnied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fear; but Riley could not hesitate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew that each second a spark was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearing the slumbering inferno in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go forward!" he thundered, and a gust</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wind took the full force of his voice into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd. "Go forward, some of you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick--before I kill you all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly Larsen jumped backward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">overboard. Equally quick, the desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">master fired, but the bullet missed its mark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Big Frank started frantically to ward</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the master, but Riley ignored him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something else had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In that maddening second a chunky</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure had rushed away from the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat's prow and off the poop, while Riley</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang to the wheel. The figure dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly across the deck. One leap and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was up the forward steps. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him to the forecastle hatch. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick tug and it came off, and the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">north wind sucked down the open hole and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew tiny sparks and wisps of smoke upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and outward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Good work, Whisky Bill--climb the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigging!" shrieked Riley, as he twisted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spokes of the wheel like a madman, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other understood somehow and went up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shrouds like a panic-stricken monkey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Riley swung the heavy ship around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ignoring the maniacs by the small boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his heart in his mouth, wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">if his next moment would be in eternity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riley pointed his ship straight into the wind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the lift of a giant wave the bow arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">till the deck tilted high and the old schooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned with the extra strain. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big wave swirled under the stern and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow lowered till Riley felt as if on top of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep hill. The next comber loomed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him like a dark, high wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on every one!" roared the master.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hold, for your lives!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bowsprit dived straight into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foaming, seething wall of water that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed onward till it struck the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hatchway. Then vats and firkins and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons of brine swept into the hold and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lethal light snuffed out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big wave swirled aft in foaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzy. It slapped the mainmast with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty force. It struck the break of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poop and climbed up, up, till the feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees and thighs of the master were under</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold water and he held to the wheel fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically while the slavering mass of brine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and foam tried to suck him away from it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The small boat disappeared unseen. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually the heavy mass of water grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower about the skipper's legs and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful pressure lessened. The ship's bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stern came up heavily and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old craft groaned and slumped down--</seg><seg type="columnLine">waterlogged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," breathed the half-naked Riley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he began to swing the logy ship to port</seg><seg type="columnLine">and let the wind again catch the slatting</seg><seg type="columnLine">sails, "that is the way to put out a fire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIVE days and nights the pumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">were working till the porous-hided</seg><seg type="columnLine">old tub slowly came up out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Three men were gone--vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the small boat or overboard--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riley made up for that by peeling off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">natty brass-buttoned coat and pi telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in himself, setting an example to the hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven crew. The skipper watched that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew closely, ready for the first hostile</seg><seg type="columnLine">move. But there was none. Perhaps his</seg><seg type="columnLine">set face forestalled it as he thought over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his situation, thankful only that the cargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">was waterproof and hardly damaged. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">said little but worked and waited until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was right again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the sixth day all hands rested, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the next, refreshed and invigorated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blessed by a fresh wind that shoved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old craft joyously along, Riley went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck prepared to thresh out certain ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. Relieving the mate he ordered both</seg><seg type="columnLine">watches on deck and soon they grouped</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the poop, looking curious or em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassed, as the case might be. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with only five of his former crew before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and with the mate sleeping below, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper began his formal court martial.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You," he began, pointing a forefinger</seg><seg type="columnLine">io8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at Whisky Bill. "You said 'he tipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp over.' Who did?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weak and wobbly front his alcohol-cure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his recent labor, Bill was taken aback.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blank-faced, he tried to think while his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes swung toward the threatening face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Frank, and then away. Riley noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glance while Bill sparred for time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who? Me?" he asked, scratching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You," said the master, grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did--did I say that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You did," replied Riley, his temper</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising. "Tell me who tipped that lamp!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie thundered. "Was it this man, Frank?</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick, now--shpeak up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "M-mebbe," said Bill, nervously. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunno. I didn't see him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And a foc'sle lamp hangin' on heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains was tipped over accidental," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riley, sarcastically. "Let's see who filed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chains. You, Frank, shtep forward!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a ring of something dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Irish captain's voice and the sullen</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailor felt impelled to step forward while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riley half-descended the steps and smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him peculiarly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And why didn't ye jump into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small boat with the others when the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave hit us?" asked Riley, softly. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat was provisioned for a long cruise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't it? That was part of the big idea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't it? You'd tip over the lamp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then every one would have a fine excuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to jump into the shmall boat and ride to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aleutians. Them that wasn't in on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan would be frightened enough to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the boat anyhow. It was a fine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">genteel, beautiful idea--but why didn't ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">go into the boat? Did ye fear there'd be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitch?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big man's eyes looked at the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he said nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" snapped Riley. "Shpeak up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What about it? The second mate was</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened enough to leave. Why didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you? Are ye too brave? Or--" and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was smooth as ice and deadly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison--"did ye notice I was watchin' ye?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was still no answer from Big Frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rest of the crew watched him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some anxiously, some in amazement. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed ones included only the cook and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whisky Bill and Riley's heart sank at what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had to depend on--one lazy mate, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat cook and one half-convalescent drunk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard. But the thought only made the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">master set his jaws harder. Come what</seg><seg type="columnLine">might, Big Frank had to be punished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jumping from the steps like a cat, Riley</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed a fist straight into Big Frank's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye and followed it up with the other fist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll lead the crew to desert, will ye?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled Riley. "You'll blow the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">because ye don't like the grub, eh? All</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, you yellow sneak--try this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big sailor tried to spar off the blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the master was too eager and the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists crashed through his guard. Big Frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to with a man slushing his face with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucket of water and the master standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his prone body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're awake, are ye?" bellowed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper, noting that the rest of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very quiet. "All right--get up!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wobbly sailor was helped to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," ruled the master, "you're due for</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains but I'm short-handed. You'll help</seg><seg type="columnLine">work the ship and at night you'll be locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the afther lazaret. I'll take some o' that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swagger out o' you or I'll kill ye! Here-</seg><seg type="columnLine">afther I'll go armed. The first wrong move</seg><seg type="columnLine">you make will be your last. Undershtand?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes. Then go help the cook!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus passed the first big episode of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip across. Thereafter the ship bowled</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with Riley watchful, the mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautious, the crew subdued, and Whisky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill beginning to show tan in place of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple-red that once made his face livid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watching the man's awkward attempts at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailor-work despite his awful physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaction and noting that he never com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained, Riley's heart warmed toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">derelict, though he avoided the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of favoritism and drove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with the rest. Gradually Bill's stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant brain cleared, the half-paralyzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles whipped into shape, and he ate</seg><seg type="columnLine">better, slept better, kept his sea-legs better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riley was getting proud of his liquor-cure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whisky Bill's gratitude came on a sultry</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight weeks later when the skipper was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping in his bunk in the cabin. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate's bunk was opposite his but the mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on duty. There were no partitioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms for the officers. It saved space for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more cargo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cabin door opened stealthily and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny shaft of the lighter gloom outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">pierced the black darkness within. Not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound was heard yet Riley sensed the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and awoke with a start. Noting the streak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light he grasped the handle of a pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">On Short Allowance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">109</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">under his pillow and lay ready for action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doorway widened until more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of haze showed and a dark object</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the threshold. Then the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">began closing softly. That was the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment Riley was waiting for. Sitting up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, he had that form exactly covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pistol and his nerves were never icier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"HANDS up!" he snarled. "Quick!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right, sir," came a soft voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reply. "Wait till I close the door."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The voice was Whisky Bill's and Riley</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted and pointed the pistol-muzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward, wondering what would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">next. The door closed softly and foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps pattered across the floor to the bunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well?" snapped Riley. "What does</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I couldn't come any sooner," apologized</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill. "I'm on duty and the rest is sort o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchin' me. You see, they're goin' ',d</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow up the ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this calm announcement Riley felt his</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles tingle and his scalp itch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Again? How? Who? When?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In them straits near Japan. I forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sangar. The Japs call it Tsugaru,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Riley. "We'll pass through to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the. Japan Sea. That'll be about two</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks from now. How will this blow-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">business be done?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like last time. There'll be a fire an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody'll rush fer the boats, only this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time there ain't goin' to be no heavy sea to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the fire out. The ship's goin' to blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">fer keeps."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Um. Yes," said Riley, sarcastically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And what'll I be doin' while all this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' on--playin' solitaire?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. You'll go natural to the fire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what can be done. That's what you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, ain't it? Well, while you're lookin' at</seg><seg type="columnLine">things the rest'll skip."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Riley was thinking hard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And how do you know all this?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me? Oh, I'm one of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The statement was so cool and casual</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it made Riley's brain buzz. "One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them?" he echoed, wondering whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hug this man or shoot him for safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, I had to, or else--blooey fer me!</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I didn't stand in I'd be suspicioned, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stood in--see? I'm now the worst little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grouch in the crew exceptin' Big Frank."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I see," murmured the skipper, slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And is the whole crowd in on the plot?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The whole gang--Big Frank an' Looie</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Greek an' Changes the Sloavk/ an' me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All but the cook.

But why should the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew want to jump ship when we're almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">across?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because it's a grudge now, sir. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other time they wanted to git away because</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' the grub, but the way you handled 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">made 'em sore an' Big Frank's been jawin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' grouchin' an' stewin' till they're all</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked up. And--the grub's still with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," murmured the thoughtful master,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingering the pistol carefully. "And was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second mate--and the two other men</seg><seg type="columnLine">that left us--in on the first plot?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Naw!" replied Bill. "They was plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared, like they was expected to be."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a long silence from the skip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per's bunk, for Riley was thinking hard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thrust by fate into this worthless and dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous command and in trouble through</seg><seg type="columnLine">no direct fault of his own, he was appalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the relentlessness of the men he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted in San Francisco to make into</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors; and yet through his thoughts ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">a constant wonder at this half-cured</seg><seg type="columnLine">derelict, Whisky Bill. The man owed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing except a job, and that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poorest on the seven seas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me," said Riley, suddenly. "Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">did ye come to warn me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was another long silence before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's uncertain voice answered:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're a white guy.

"But mebbe it'll not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to a fight. I've another plan. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">say you're one with the gang forward.

You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be one of them--most valiant in cursin' ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' skipper. Then when the time draws</seg><seg type="columnLine">nigh you'll volunteer to fire the ship while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the rats scuttle toward the whale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat on the poop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Riley heard his companion gurgle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wriggle but proceeded calmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll get the job.

Then Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Riley, his mind at ease because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what was ahead and when it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, sank into his bunk and slept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep of a man without care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWELVE peaceful days followed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blessed by gracious winds that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the old schooner heel over</seg><seg type="columnLine">skittishly like a sinful old crone dancing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her second childhood. Riley cracked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sail and longed for topsails, but even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she was the old tub slapped her blunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows in the lively waves and lumbered along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a foaming wake that gladdened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper's heart. True, the short-handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew had to work the pumps a bit every</seg><seg type="columnLine">day and the awful provender kept con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuous nausea aboard, but the master felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the worst was over and he waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the anticipated climax calmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came on the hazy morning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirteenth day when the old schooner was</seg><seg type="columnLine">loafing her way into Sangar Strait. Fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles northward, beyond the vague curtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of haze that hid Volcano Bay, lay the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Yezo; seventy miles straight ahead was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hakodate; and forty miles southeast was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cape Shiriya, northern rampart of Hondo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mainland of Japan. Between the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible landmarks stretched the gray-blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet of water clear to the western horizon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a faint patch of dark smoke hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">low in the heavy air. The old schooner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">booms were slatting to port and starboard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparring for puffs of wind, and the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">jibs dawdled limply from the foremast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ship was making bare steerage-way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At ten o'clock Riley took his sight at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blurred sun and established position</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Blazon napped below, Big Frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">lounged in the waist of the ship, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slovak smoked lazily at the wheel. Whisky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill and the Greek were supposed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping in the forecastle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, yelling at the top of his voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Greek burst out of the forecastle door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a faint wisp of smoke following his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. Big Frank jumped toward him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Riley, at the poop, lowered his sextant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knew the moment had come. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol was in his pocket but he kept it there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire!" yelled the Greek, breaking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps to the poop. "Fire forward!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the first shout Big Frank joined him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started aft, also yelling. The speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their actions showed that quick develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were expected, and out of the tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his eye Riley noted that the falls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whaleboat were arranged for a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">launching of the craft. He knew the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">would jump up the starboard steps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">On Short Allowance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rush for that boat, and they did, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmsman joined them, while from the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">space beyond the forecastle doorway poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">a denser column of smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Riley sought the port steps and rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the deck. Once there he ignored the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited group at the whaleboat and hurtled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the forecastle, where the smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">became denser. As he reached the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">another figure came out, running head</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Halt!" yelled Riley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whisky Bill looked up, saw the master,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is the fire out?" snapped Riley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mostly," said Bill, grinning. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes next, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll shtop laughin' before them</seg><seg type="columnLine">thraitors on the poop see ye!" commanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the irascible skipper, laying a heavy hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his shoulder. "You're bein' forced into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flamin' ruins by an overbearin' and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartless tyrant, so they'll not wait for ye!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heaved Bill into the smoky forecastle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tumbled in himself, closing the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light from the blurred hatch above</seg><seg type="columnLine">disclosed a strange sight to the coughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper. On the aisle between two rows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of aged and smelly bunks stripped of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheap blankets and quilts lay a pile of half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackened, smoldering wet cloth and papers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading to an oil can half-full of liquid ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet away. Arising from the floor, Whisky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill started to tip the contents of the can</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the smoking embers. Riley jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grasped his hand wrathfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dhrop that!" he roared. "Are ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aw'right," obeyed Bill, "only it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Water?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. That's my idea, sir. I told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others we'd better light the rags an' run</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slow trail to the oil-can, so she'd explode</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure inside of a minute. Then the fire'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be too big fer you to control when you got</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. See? They said I was one bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy. So I poured the oil out o' the can an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped water in. Then I stuck some oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">around under the bunks to make it smell</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. See?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The revelation floored Riley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By all the saints!" he exclaimed, slump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing against a bunk. "I'd never think it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in ye! You're a jewel, me lad--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewel!" And he slapped the man's back</seg><seg type="columnLine">affectionately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Footsteps pattered on the deck outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a hand fumbled at the door-latch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two men straightened suddenly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opened and the round face of Journet,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the cook, peered in owlishly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I theenk I hear noise," he explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he saw who was inside. "Some men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they leave very fast in a boat, sir. What</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's throuble," said Riley. "The crew's</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted. Here--" and he handed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished cook the pistol--"take this and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that no one comes aboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Riley turned to Bill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now that they've gone we'll go out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side," he said. "Go you into the cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake Blazong, and bring up all the arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can get. Then go aft and 'wait orders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let no one come aboard. Undershtand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill nodded and accompanied Riley on</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck while the bewildered cook stood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingered the unaccustomed pistol specu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">latively. Without a glance at the whale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat being rowed frantically a quarter-mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, Riley climl&gt;ed to the deserted poop</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took the wheel, slowly swinging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamite-ship back into her old course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then, looking past the three big masts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the jibs, Riley's eyes widened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coming on with a bone in her teeth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trail of black smoke pouring backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">from thick stacks was a narrow-beamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray warship. She was still far away but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riley saw she was headed in his direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wondered if she had noticed the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sertion of his crew; but just then, as Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sleepy Blazon came up the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panionway and joined the skipper, a puff</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wind whipped the waters toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner and caught the sails, making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old ship heel with renewed life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what I wanted!" muttered Riley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he spun the spokes of the wheel. "Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll show them scoundhrels a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishipline!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    OBEYING Riley's hand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner swung to port and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vjifw tQ overtake |_]1e laboring whaleboat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inch by inch, foot by foot, yard by yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">she gained on the astonished rowers until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long bowsprit towered above them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the big bows threatened to grind them</seg><seg type="columnLine">under. Then, while the alarmed men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat were standing up and yelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their oars began to slip out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tholes, the master swung the schooner to</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">starboard, passing them on the broadside</seg><seg type="columnLine">but keeping a few yards away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Toss out a line!" roared Riley to Blazon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bill, and they hurled a slim rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the whaleboat as the big ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumbered by. The Greek in the bow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smaller boat looked at Big Frank, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stern. Frank nodded and the Greek</seg><seg type="columnLine">made fast while Bill twisted the other end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the line about a bitt by the stern of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner. As the rope tightened it whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smaller craft under the stern of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamite-ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the moment Riley had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, ye sneakin' scum, I've got ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I want ye--you threacherous</seg><seg type="columnLine">hounds!" he roared leaving the wheel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking a fist over the stern. "You'll shtick</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that boat and do penance across the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japan Sea and then you'll face a court--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you greasy swine! One wrong move and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll hang you all. The first man that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thries to come aboard here will be shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if any of ye thries to cut the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">adlirift--Gawd help ye! Undershtand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the stern of the whaleboat Big Frank's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right arm' reached backward. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper's eye grew cold and he pointed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic carefully while Blazon and Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood ready to back him up. Big Frank's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm came half-forward with a big blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver. With a shriek the Slovak rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him and grabbed at his wrist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Faced at last with deliberate mutiny--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a man in the crew had brought forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pistol against the master--Riley's gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes betrayed a flame that meant death for</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody; and yet his voice was soft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Throw that gun overboard," he purred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"or I'll finish the whole boatload of ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an instant of inaction. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">upturned face of Big Frank was livid with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage but his wrist was frantically held by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terror-stricken Slovak, while the Greek</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowered in the bow. Then, sullenly, Big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frank released his fingers from the ^pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it dropped into the foanjing wake of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitching, tossing whaleboat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Tis well," Riley nodded to his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions. "And now we'll take turns at</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardin' the shtern while the others work</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. It's short-handed we are--and Gawd</seg><seg type="columnLine">help us if there's a blow--but praise be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're rid o' them mutineers at last. Hello--</seg><seg type="columnLine">what's this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking forward, the trio perceived the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray cruiser nearing them off the starboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow, with her clipper-prow slicing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves and her yards whipping backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wind she created. From her taff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail snapped a red sun-flag with numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays--the ensign of the Japanese navy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even as the three men watched her several</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored flags broke from the halyards over</seg><seg type="columnLine">her high bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That'll be a Jap patrol-ship," said Riley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes feasting on the trim lines of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser with its guns peeping from case-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments along the main deck. "Hello--</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's signals. International code. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">want us to shtop! All right. Shtop it is!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he spun the wheel hard over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dynamite-ship swung into the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to starboard and the cruiser drew up until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the schooner's men could see the blue-clad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japs lounging about its decks. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warship forged by and stopped, her wash</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the whaleboat bob up and down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water like mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five minutes later a dark-skinned sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieutenant scrambled aboard the sailing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship from a launch, followed by six natty</seg><seg type="columnLine">little armed sailors. With the dignity</seg><seg type="columnLine">befitting the master of a better ship the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trim Riley descended from the poop to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow his visitors aboard and the Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieutenant returned the bow, coming to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point without further parley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I regret arrest this boat," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer, bowing again in apology unutterable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blow took Riley aback.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Arresht?" he exclaimed. "What for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The officer shrugged his shoulders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed over the bulwark, toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain Itsibuki talk Eenglees," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested. "You go now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though polite the request was so terse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and full of meaning that the baffled Riley</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered what his crime was. His mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverted to the happenings of the trip but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found no clue. Resistance was impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unjustified, though, so Riley deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to see this Japanese navy captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," he sighed. "I'm ready as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as I get my papers.

It may not surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, but America is now at war with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation he worked for. When you left port</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject was foreign to all that had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">before and as the others listened they won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered what it was all about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Michael Onstorff, traitor to Russia,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured the reading officer. "Born in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Baltic provinces and educated at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dantzig.

In 1913 he traveled in Afghan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istan and India. In 1914 he received high</seg><seg type="columnLine">position in the Siberian service. After that</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain shipments of explosives went in</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret from Vladivostok to men very busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with plots of enemies of the Allies in British</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonies, especially India. Michael On-</seg><seg type="columnLine">storff was caught at it and shot at Vlad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ivostok by the Russian garrison on May</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth, while you were at sea."

There never was such a depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. It was--what you call--a graft</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the side.

And after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way you saved your cargo, the Russian and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japanese Governments owe you a very- deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">debt." The officer bowed gracefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right," murmured Riley, returning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow and preparing to leave, "and mebbe</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time I'll command a real ship that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not run so cheap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The officer's eyes met Riley and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are five big full-riggers to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">delivered to English owners by the Kobe</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipyards within a month, and trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">masters are hard to find these days," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, bowing again.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a newspaper from his pocket, folded</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to a certain point, and mused over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short article his procedure had exposed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a lusty splashing in his tub Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say, old man," he broke forth, "isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">there another way to reach the Santa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marta Road than by the Avenue Alex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ander?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, only I thought-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I saw the shack all right, but it cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a fib, and I got found out in it." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned at Segovia's puzzled look, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started dressing. "Miss Taylor," he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, "was in front, and I stopped and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her. That's what did the business</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me.

And I rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">think you'd have hard work convincing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Taylor of it. If you succeeded she</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't stay on as Morales' guest, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she left his house she would also have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave Cortina, or Morales would get wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">to what had happened.

He was a young man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant parts and promise, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now in Cortina to visit his old college class-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate in Virginia, the Senor Don Enrique</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia. The two were to be the guests</seg><seg type="columnLine">at dinner on Thursday night at the home</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Senor Don Manuel Morales, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eminent banker, where Mr. Perry would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the pleasure of meeting a fair com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patriot, Miss Mary Taylor, the distin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guished author and traveler who was but</seg><seg type="columnLine">just arrived in Cortina from an extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay in Guatemala, and who was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honored guest of the Senora Dona Morales.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great snakes!" sputtered Jimmy. "Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devil put this rot in the paper about me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I wondered," said Segovia. "Mr. Lane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you think?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lane? He's not a fool!" snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy. "Who wants to be paraded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">print like this at any time, and especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a time when one seeks to move about</seg><seg type="columnLine">with as little noise as possible? Lane</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows that. This is some of Morales'</seg><seg type="columnLine">doings, Enrique. He has made me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked man, and under the cover of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">compliment. A friend of the nephew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secretary of state--look out for him!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's a warning to the anti-administration</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It does look like it," agreed Segovia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I wish they'd start something in the open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This waiting gets on my nerves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And mine," echoed Jimmy.

Oh, I say!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I haven't told you about the dandy bird-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage I've found for our Hun. We got</seg><seg type="columnLine">shunted off from it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He recounted the pertinent details of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit to Brewer, and described the strong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and the defensive properties of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. They discussed the possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rescue party, and Segovia expressed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self as heartily in favor of arming the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fenders of the rural citadel. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage easily to get the rifles. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak to his uncle about it, or to Ortega.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course I shall be with you, Jimmy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he declared when their conference was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended.

"Your place is here</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the city to ward off suspicion from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm.

Jimmy grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him, and added artfully--"By the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I forgot to tell you that the automobile</seg><seg type="columnLine">took Miss Taylor's eye immensely--espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially when she learned that it was yours."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia tried to appear unconcerned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of this announcement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm glad she liked it," he said carelessly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And that reminds me: I'm due in half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour to drive Miss Taylor to the State</seg><seg type="columnLine">Department to see my uncle.

Led-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers, balance-sheets and other business</seg><seg type="columnLine">records were spread out on the table before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Three men of a military carriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore the minister company. They were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact, reservist officers of the imperial</seg><seg type="columnLine">army, though; here in Zanhoria they mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">queraded as plain lumbermen. Kaufman</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself was anything but a martial figure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet in his day he had served with the colors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was short, and ruddy, with a paunch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beard, and heavy-lidded eyes under great</seg><seg type="columnLine">120</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bushy brows--a coarse, gross, bowelless</seg><seg type="columnLine">product of beef and beer and overweening</seg><seg type="columnLine">racial self-sufficiency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think we have finished, gentlemen,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "The affairs of the syndicate are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in satisfactory order, and my inspection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the property shows that it is being</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked to the maximum advantage.

Yes, Captain Karsch, I am sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the committee--quite."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A gaunt, towering man who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflectively drawing on his pipe put it aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spoke.

On the night of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">designated day I will dispatch, by way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river to Puerto Mono, one hundred men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in command of Captain Karsch to seize the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable station and cover Peralta's landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their machine guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will leave fifty men to patrol the camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with the rest take possession of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad, cut the telegraph, and proceed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cortina.

He had heard, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, a movement just outside his door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He strode to it, and opened it. A little</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure in gray was in the act of inserting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">key in the door across the hall. Her back</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to him, and he drew in quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the Sam Hill ails you?" queried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy softly lowered his transom. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said with a lurking grin:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have a neighbor. A Mrs. Rebecca</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isaacs of New York."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! So she's on this floor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I have said. You had a call from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">this afternoon, something tells me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Something lies to you then," rejoined</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy; but he evinced interest in this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">topic. "Queer! I was going to speak to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this Mrs. Ikev. What made you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A little while after you left I saw her go</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. She turned into your street.

She didn't stop. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't give us even a look. She went</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight on to the German legation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew in. I watched her. Struck me as kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of funny, an American going into that joint.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I kept an eye open, but I didn't see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out.

But she</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't have been there all that time--</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Um," grunted Jimmy. He was busy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with his cravat. "You said she came in</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Jamaica?" He was recalling what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy had surmised of Miss Taylor--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she, too,' had come from the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ricky said she did," the boy replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She might have come from anywhere on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Puerto Mono Road."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Arraca?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The German concession.

"I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut it, that's what!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so loud," Jimmy cautioned. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">a neighbor, please remember.

That's all you'll get out of me</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the present. Will you be a good boy, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be good," vowed Billy meekly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy put on his hat, and with a cat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tread went to the door. He opened it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quick jerk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going down.

He thought he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen Mrs. Isaac's door close as he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from his room. Had she been listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hall?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy acknowledged that the incident</seg><seg type="columnLine">in itself was trivial. He would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">given it a thought were it not for what Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told him of the woman's visit to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German mission. This nagged at his un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstanding; the fingers of his mind twid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled with it irresolutely. Why should thifc</seg><seg type="columnLine">person on the instant of her arrival in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city seek out the representatives of a nation</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which her own country was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brink of war? It did not somehow look</seg><seg type="columnLine">right; and yet what was wrong with it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her errand may have been simply to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">information on a business matter--Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans were active in business in all the Cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tral American States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Deuce take it," he grumbled, "I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">that boy to lunch for entertainment, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a bunch of worries handed me. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Taylor in the South when she came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the North, and he saw this Mrs. Isaacs</seg><seg type="columnLine">hobnobbing with the Huns when she should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been gossiping with him. I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make head or tail of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His opportunity came, and he went over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see you have another visitor from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">States," he remarked casually to the mul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilingual Ricardo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Si, Mr. Perree.

To himself he said: "Jews</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't send their women-folk chasing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world alone. It sounds pretty thin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He brought up with a grunt of surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia was coming toward him, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">air was anxious and harassed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello!" Jimmy saluted him. "I wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">expecting you till seven."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Segovia drew him aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The dinner must wait," he said.

We must avoid at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then laugh a little," prompted Jimmy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and we'll ease out of this as if we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on a lark, and not to a funeral. Act</seg><seg type="columnLine">the part, Enrique."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed his own advice, and Segovia</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out to play up to him. When they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the street they strolled west along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the square to the Calle Central. Here they</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned northward. Jimmy seized the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity when no one was within close</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing to put the question that was clamor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in him for utterance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has broken loose, old man?

They strolled north along the low gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den wall. As they came to an opening in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia stopped. A sergeant of police was</seg><seg type="columnLine">loitering toward them. Segovia spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, a low-breathed word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vayase" he answered, and passed on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick! In with you," Segovia said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy, and followed on his heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were swallowed up in the shrubbery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made their way swiftly to a door under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small portico at the farther end of the walk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were, as Segovia had said, expected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door opened as they approached. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in plain black, who stood unobtru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sively back in the entrance, looked narrowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Segovia, bowed, and noiselessly closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door after them. He conducted them up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corridor and across a colonnaded patio in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which a tinkling fountain made pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">music. A lemon-tree grew by the fountain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were roses and jasmine in bloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about. Above the first stars were blos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soming in the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the patio they entered another cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor, and were invited into a waiting-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlooking the court. Their attendant</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared. A moment later a young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in. He bowed ceremoniously to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy, and went with extended hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ola, amigo! Como le va?" he exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordially.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Segovia introduced him to Jimmy. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the Senor Don Leon Machada, Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent Hurango's private secretary. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few courteous words he begged the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to follow him. They passed down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the corridor and were ushered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a spacious rose-tinted chamber where,</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing to meet him, Jimmy beheld the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hon.

There were three</seg><seg type="columnLine">others in the room--Don Luis Valera, Don</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emilio Ortega, and a massive old man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">piercing black eyes, and a lined, strong face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had risen as the secretary announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the callers and, with a friendly gesture to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia, stood waiting, his eyes intent on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Lane had received a personal cable</seg><seg type="columnLine">that afternoon from Senator Perry.

I'll agree with you from the start in</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything you can say of Miss Taylor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal charm. She's handsome as a pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture--all that--but when you come down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bald facts what do you or I know of her?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morales is a traitor to his country. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't believe such a man on his dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">oath. Why should I believe him when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">says Miss Taylor is, for instance, a distin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guished writer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She herself told us she was preparing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a series of articles for a magazine.

The interview,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you know, was brief."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" said Jimmy again. "And she</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasn't mentioned it to you, or anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her work?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. We talked of other things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A rara avis, by Jove!" exclaimed Jimmy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"People, let me introduce to your attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">a modest author. The only one at large."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He laughed, though with a covert scru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny of his friend. Segovia drew himself up</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think we have pursued the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">far enough," he remarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only one thing more," Jimmy inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected. "Miss Taylor says she is just ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived from Guatemala. Billy Smith of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States legation says he saw her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Canal Zone on Sunday. How do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">account for that, amigo mio?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Segovia stumbled in his walk, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, and went on. Jimmy could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gasping breath he drew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where, please," he asked with forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm, "has Mr. Smith seen Miss Taylor in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cortina?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He lunched with me today.

She has the lingo down pat, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's a wee bit of an accent. It's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzling me. It may be Swedish, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then again it may be German. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bosh!" shot out Segovia.

You are letting</seg><seg type="columnLine">your imagination run away with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They strode on in silence for some time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearing now the Plaza Central.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hang it, old fellow," Jimmy exploded</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sudden, "I know how it is with you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'm sorry.

You might</seg><seg type="columnLine">let something drop--not meaning to, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course--that would put us in the hole. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to tell you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right, Jimmy," Enrique said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he made a little difficulty of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We won't talk about it any more now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">please."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right you are!" acceded Jimmy cheer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.

He walked slowly, revolv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in his mind the disclosure Jimmy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to him. Of course Smith was mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken, yet he cast back a little uneasily to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his conversation with Miss Taylor in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">car that afternoon. As he recalled it--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a flush of self-vexation--the talk was</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely about himself, his aspirations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">future plans; the kind of stuff a sympathetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman auditor encourages a man to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">large upon. And, too, she had asked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Perry; but there was nothing singu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar in that. He was her countryman; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was natural that she should show an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He recalled further that she had inquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually if he thought Zanhoria would side</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the United States in the war or remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">neutral; and if there were not rumors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble in the country. She had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of the sort in her journeyings</seg><seg type="columnLine">before coming to Cortina. Was it true,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or just political gossip?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It gratified him now to remember that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disparaged it, had in fact, conveyed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her the impression that it was ridiculed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Government. On the other hand, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unable for the life of him to attach any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister significance to her question. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, as every one knew, rumors afloat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble with Peralta, and if another had</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked his opinion of it he would have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing strange in it. Why, then, mistrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary Taylor?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Segovia's thoughts traveled on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing Washington dispatch, and a doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">assailed him. The devilish leisureliness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tiny hand on Jimmy's watch-dial! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have been done in the time his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">was turned if one was skilled enough in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. But Mary Taylor! No, no, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inconceivable! And then came a sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Valgame DiosI" he exclaimed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck his fist triumphantly into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had only the word of his uncle's</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary that "three copies were made.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Luis had not said that he himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted them; he was engaged with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitor at the time. The secretary might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made a mistake. He might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made only two copies or, if three, he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have mislaid one in the mass of papers on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk. It was possible--probable, in fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He would take the matter up with his uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Segovia in these communings had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Avenida Alejandrino. He hesitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned into it. The day had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm. Mary might be out in front enjoy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the evening cool. He might, indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a word with her. ■</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he came to the house he caught sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of spectral forms in the loggia--the ghostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">white of sheer lawn dresses. He stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung on his heel, then takiag hold of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage he started up to the door. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a movement in the loggia, the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering voices, the scrape of a chair on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. A man peered over the balus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade. It was Morales.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who comes?" he questioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tone was not altogether friendly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia paused with the feeling that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intruder. And yet the hour was not late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is I, Senor Morales--Enrique Sego-</seg><seg type="columnLine">via," he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the space of a breath there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">response. One of the white-clad forms dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved from view. Morales spoke again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Senor Segovia? Ah! Oh! This is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected pleasure, senor; a very delight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful surprise. One moment, please, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be down. I regret to say that the Dona</seg><seg type="columnLine">Natalia is not at all well, or we should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you up with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A thousand commiserations, senor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I beg of you do not disturb yourself," put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Segovia hastily. He had no itch for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exchange of platitudes with the banker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was out walking," he continued, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing, as I thought, the ladies in the loggia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I made bold to come in. Please assure the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senora Morales of my very earnest sympa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thies, and Miss Taylor of my profound re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was turning away when a silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh rippled out to him. It was followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a delightfully mocking voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if Miss Taylor should choose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">receive the compliment at first-hand, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia?

Miss Tay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lor, and likewise her host, had gone in.

"But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  you have been walking; shall we sit down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  for the small time I have. There is a bench</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  somewhere--ah, here it is. Now, tell me;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  what are these unpleasant thoughts you've</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  had of me?

Miss</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Taylor, as she urged her question, bent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  toward her companion trying to read his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  face in the dim light.

Why, I walked up this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  way tonight just to be a little nearer to you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I did not dare to hope for this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Her hand found his, rested 011 it, pressed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  it softly. Before she could withdraw it he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  had snatched it to his lips and covered it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  with kisses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "You silly boy," she murmured, "it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  only a few hours since we were together."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She disengaged her hand gently.

We shall go again, shall we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  not, my friend? And those letters; he will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  give them to me?

"If it was poetry now, or ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mance--something delicate and beautiful--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could. Do you know that yesterday,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I met you, and learned that you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so traveled, I was really afraid of you at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first. Then I tried to think of something</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching Guatemala to talk with you about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I couldn't. I had been to Champerico</seg><seg type="columnLine">once--a yachting cruise--and all I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember of it was the smells!

Wisdom returned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nudged him.

"You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to parade your wolf up to the very door</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make us believe he's going to come in."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She did not laugh with him.

It was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock when he laid the book down, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought his bed. Sleep did not come to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was thinking of the meeting with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President of Zanhoria, of Kaufman's re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn, of his appointment with Ortega</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning, of all the happenings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It might have been half an hour later</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when he heard through his transom a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeak. It was the door across the hall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was Mrs. Isaacs coming out or going in?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in either case why was a solitary</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman prowling about at this hour of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy's curiosity, whetted by the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed suspicions he entertained, moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to an act of espionage which under</seg><seg type="columnLine">other circumstances he would have scorned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He got up and opened his door cautiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a crack. He widened it gently and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered out into the dim twilight of the hall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Isaacs, in a long kimono, was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">act of passing through the last door on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the corridor. There was the flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an electric torch as she disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a rule with Jimmy to know his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereabouts in a strange hotel in the event</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fire, and he knew that the door Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isaacs had vanished through gave upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flight of stairs to the roof. He drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into his room, mystified and a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great Heaven!" he ejaculated.

The echo</seg><seg type="columnLine">had scarcely died away when the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sounds came to Jimmy from the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall. A moment or two later the door op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite squeaked.

It was sheer inquisitiveness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">impelled him. He hoped to find some evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence of Mrs. Isaacs' visit to the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked about him. With the excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of odds and ends of old newspapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street tourbillions had sent wheeling up</seg><seg type="columnLine">through many weeks there was nothing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof to excite comment. He walked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north parapet and looked over. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plaza Central was spread out before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond, in the distance, were the Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment buildings and the president's man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. Between these and the business sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the city was a checkered map of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many-tinted dwellings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy's gaze returned to the square at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. An automobile was stopping be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the Banco Nacional. He recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morales alighting from it. And that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Taylor with him; Jimmy could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake that erect, elegant figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A busy day for you Senor Renegado,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered. "I wonder how you will get</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dispatch to Kaufman? You can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone him for fear of somebody listen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in. You can't take it yourself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't think you'd risk trusting it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mails--not now. A messenger, perhaps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But not Miss Taylor; that wouldn't do at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The car drove off. It drew up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">post-office on the east side of the square,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Miss Taylor got out and went in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy grinned derisively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sending a story home to her magazine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe.

Great stuff!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was turning away when in. the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the Calle Comercio he saw a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that arrested him. It was the Imperial</seg><seg type="columnLine">German standard fluttering up to the peak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its tall staff. He could see the man at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the halyards. La Caridad was striking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nine o'clock.

They are always on the job, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little frowning knot popped out be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween his eyes as he stood surveying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flag. His thoughts returned to Mrs. Isaacs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder if that had anything to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her trip up here? 1 wonder if she sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naled-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1-Ie broke off with a curt laugh at him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. It was black night when Mrs. Isaacs</seg><seg type="columnLine">made her visit to the roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy suddenly crouched down behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parapet. His eyes had lighted on a.</seg><seg type="columnLine">small figure in gray crossing the plaza from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the east. It was Mrs. Isaacs. He watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">her from his hiding-place. She was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandstand now. Here she stopped, lin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered a moment, and went on, but with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp turn to the north. It would bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">her out at a point directly in face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banco Nacional.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello!" Jimmy exclaimed. "She is going</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as he voiced his surprise Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isaacs crossed the street and entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. Jimmy again mocked at himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What of it? What did I go there for?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What do hundreds, thousands of people go</seg><seg type="columnLine">there for? Bah! I'm making mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of molehills. To the deuce with Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isaacs! I'm going to get some breakfast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the point of leaving he cast another</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at the post-office. The Morales car</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone. He swept the four sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">square for a sight of it. but in vain. Where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon he retraced his steps to the hatch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before going in he looked off to the south</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the piled-up mountains drew a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred blue wave-line across the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That highest peak must be Borazo, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping volcano, from the top of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winifred Brewer had said the Pacific could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen. He could vision the girl as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stood beside him in the bungalow out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the old stone house. It was a picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had summoned up more than once in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past twenty-four hours, and each time from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new angle of discovered charm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went down the stairs, and to his de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">layed breakfast. Subsequently he loitered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the lobby impatient for Enrique to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive and tell him that the guns were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready. He would start for the hacienda</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately after keeping his appointment</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Ortega at eleven. It was past ten now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A young man came in from the street, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke to the clerk. Jimmy, happening to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look that way, saw the amiable Mr. Gomez</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing him out. The young man came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to where he was standing, bowed low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tendered him an envelope monogramed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">134</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tengo el honor de presentarle urn carta</seg><seg type="columnLine">del Senor Don Manuel Morales " he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bowed himself away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy thought of calling him back, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected that were an answer desired the</seg><seg type="columnLine">messenger would have waited. He found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chair, sat down, took out his penknife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slit open the envelope. Whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senor Morales' proficiency in oral English,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he evidently was not sure of himself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the written word. The note was in Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish. Jimmy made rather heavy weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, but finally mastered the contents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stripped of a maze of flowery superlatives</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reduced to bald terms, he was informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Senora Morales was seriously ill, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dinner invitation was recalled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That dispatch, of course," he specu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated. "This is what Ortega expected."</seg><seg type="columnLine">His mouth widened humorously. "I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to eat four bananas, and I hate the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the darned things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat on, hoping for Segovia's appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance. Was there any hitch about the guns?</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, there couldn't be; he had the Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's secret sanction at his back. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dickens could be keeping him, then?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At ten minutes of eleven Jimmy aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doned hope of Segovia's coming. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the desk and asked for a sheet of paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will find me with E. O. after</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleven," he wrote.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sealed the note, and charged the clerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give it into Segovia's hands if he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. Then he set out to keep his engagement</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Ortega.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE TURNED south from the plaza</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Calle Central, walked two</seg><seg type="columnLine">squares, and came to a long, ram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling structure pierced with an archway</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led into a great paved quadrangle. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farther end yawned the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">municipal prison. Around the quadrangle</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors opened into various administrative</seg><seg type="columnLine">departments--the lower courts of law,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mayor's office, city police, and what not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also here was to be found the office of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">State superintendent of police. The posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was, in effect, a cabinet one, though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not so dignified in the Zanhorian con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy passed in under the arch. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew his way thus far, for it was here he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come on Monday night with Enrique. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man whom he accosted conducted him to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door to the left and into a waiting-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Here his name was taken in to an adjoining</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and almost instantly thereafter he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ushered into this sancum. The super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intendent was standing at his desk to greet</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. They shook hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should have told you," Ortega said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"of my private entrance from the street--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that." He indicated a door at his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It would have relieved you of this trouble."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm afraid I've kept you waiting,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy apologized. "I was hoping to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enrique Segovia, and hung on till the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute. Those guns, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ortega placed a chair for him, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed his seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did not Senor Segovia mention it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" he asked. "I arranged with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it last night at supper. The guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out early this morning in a cart--</seg><seg type="columnLine">four Mausers and as many Colts.

"It's all right, of course." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned a laugh and remarked: "I reckon</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd better send out for some bananas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm due to eat a few."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes.

Since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was acquainted with the essence of it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner did not concern him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I imagined you would hear from him,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his only comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say, Senor Superintendent," exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy as a sudden thought visited him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What if those two held a meeting last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night? They can't let the grass grow under</seg><seg type="columnLine">them now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If Morales knew of Kaufman's return,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that is not certain, he would have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty in seeing him.

It's an invasion of extra-territorial</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They can not complain. They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">operating a secret wireless in contravention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the public law," returned the superin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendent. "Y011 will report to me here, please,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at half-past ten tonight for instructions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy felt that the interview, so far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was concerned, was at an end. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly twelve, and he remembered that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro Sam, Brewer's chauffeur, would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the post-office at twelve. He would send</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word to Winifred by Sam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I will be going, Don Emilio,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "I have taken up enough of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I; I will be going too, unless you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have something more to say to me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Segovia added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ortega rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing more this morning. Just keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive until tonight," he smiled. "Go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way you came, Jimmy, if you please.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">139</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It will excite less remark than if you both</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave by the same door, should any one be</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As jimmy, a few minutes later, issued</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the archway into the Calle Central</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked about for Enrique. He glimpsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him going down the street away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaza. Jimmy drew a breath of relief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had felt, there in Ortega's office, a sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of constraint with Enrique, and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling was mutual Enrique's present action</seg><seg type="columnLine">evinced. He had not waited for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy was sorry that this cloud had arisen</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them, for he liked the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zanhorian whole-heartedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, well, it won't last," he reflected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When Enrique gets over this Mary Taylor</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever he'll be worth while again." His</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow wrinkled as another view of the situ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation obtruded itself. "Suppose, after all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should be right about her--where would</seg><seg type="columnLine">I get off? At the wrong stop, by Jove!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Confound women anyway!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this sage conclusion he hurried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to send a message to Winifred. It had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">his intention to drop into the hotel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribble a few lines advising her that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt was for this night, but he aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doned it. The noon hour was booming out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was afraid that Sam might not wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prescribed fifteen minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came to the square and cut across it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the post-office. Sam was already on</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and Jimmy noted with approval</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had placed his car some little way</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from the office, before a house-renting</seg><seg type="columnLine">agency, he gathered from the sign in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. Jimmy felt that he would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite such a conspicuous target for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious eyes of those going in and out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the public building when he spoke to Sam.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would be but a word, for he knew from</seg><seg type="columnLine">much experience with negroes their inability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to "carry straight" a verbal message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy lounged indifferently up to the car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw that the tonneau was piled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">packages and boxes, things to eat, he sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mised. The delivery of the guns had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, prompted Brewer to lay in stores</seg><seg type="columnLine">against possible eventualities. Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of Sam's elbow Jimmy stopped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuvered to light a cigaret. He spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the man under his breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sam, I am Mr. James Perry. Sit still!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yessuh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black remained quiescent as a block</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ebony. Jimmy continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say to Miss Winifred this: 'Lookforme</seg><seg type="columnLine">late tonight.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Look for me late tonight,' " repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good! You have earned five dollars,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy said, and walked on drawing 011 his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cigaret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something--the nudging of a sixth sense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might have been--impelled him to glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him. Sam was starting off. Stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the door of the renting-agency was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Isaacs. The machine moved away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she came on. Jimmy hastily turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">front again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did she spring from?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself irritably. "It will be getting so</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty soon that I'll be seeing her in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. I wonder if she caught on to it that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	was talking with Sam? I wonder--great</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns!--if she was taking in the number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the car?" He laughed shortly. "Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bosh! I'm a regular old maid. I'll be look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing under the bed for burglars next."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless, he did not go directly up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Calle Commercio to his legation, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had intended, but stopped in at a tobacco</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop on the corner. Here he spent ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes selecting a box of cigars. It helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to dodge Mrs. Isaacs, and besides he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would want something to smoke at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hacienda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JIMMY received a distinct shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he approached the legation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morales' car stood in front of it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hon. John Henry Lane, bareheaded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was escorting out to it no other than Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary Taylor. Jimmy was still some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance down the street, and he slipped into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway to recover from this midriff thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his suspicions of the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be shot if this don't get my goat!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he inelegantly remarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard presently the grunt of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism as the clutch was let in, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he recollected that the car was pointed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. As he was not of a mind to be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected skulking in a doorway he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, and proceeded leisurely up the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Taylor's quick eye singled him out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She spoke to her driver and the car slid up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the walk precisely at the point that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would intercept Jimmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you do, Mr. Perry?" she called</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused, apparently surprised and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">140</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, how do you do?" he returned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm beginning to believe that I wa\ bom</seg><seg type="columnLine">to good luck. This is the second time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had the happiness of seeing you</seg><seg type="columnLine">today."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She widened her wonderful eyes at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Indeed! And the first time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were going into the post-office."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you wouldn't stop and speak?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, I was too far oil. And I was late</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my breakfast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," she said with a radiant smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"is the cleverest excuse you could offer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11	is so entirely satisfying. If I had robbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">you of your breakfast what would you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought when you learned that I was also</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deny you your dinner--or that Senor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morales was? Viene &amp; ser lo mismo. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have his apologies--yes? Poor Dona Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">talia! She is really wretchedly indisposed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Please convey to her my sympathy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Senor Morales," Jimmy entreated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming concern. "For myself I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost beyond recall a pleasure that Senor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morales kindly intimated was simply de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred. I am leaving Cortina very shortly."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her face expressed polite regret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are going away for good?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Or ill--one never knows."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean that you are going home to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight the Germans, I suppose."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Eventually, if not now. Just at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I am on my way to a luncheon</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment with the American minister."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He grinned. "At least I am reasonably</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of that one meal. I have it here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He touched the package under his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed in real amusement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Lane!" she exclaimed. "I am just</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him. I came down on some errands</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dona Natalia forgot to mention to me this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. We chanced to pass through this</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, and I saw the flag--Old Glory!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She clasped her hands as might a saint at</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayer. "I just had to go in and register.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Mr. Lane! Such a charming man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So--so--" her eyes were ecstatic--"beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully impressed with the responsibilities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eminent post. I adore him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hang it, she's making fun of him, thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy. I'll risk a shot at her. He said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You found the key to his weak spot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I perceive; yet really Lane isn't such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ass as he seems--he can see through a mill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone with a hole in it as well as the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, especially if there's a pretty woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the far end. But I'm keeping you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He held out his hand. "Enrique has told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me of his call on you last night." He imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ined he felt her fingers flex slightly. "Poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap! You have bewitched him, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't know it. Or might it be proper to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say 'lucky chap' of one who is under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell?" He laughed good-naturedly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattled on. "I won't say good-by; it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad medicine. I'll say--how is it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">German--auf wiedersehn? Anyway, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean I shall exist only in the hope of seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">you again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She bit her lip, for he had bowed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved away before she could frame an</seg><seg type="columnLine">adequate rejoinder. She bade the driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on, and leaned back with a delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown penciled between her sea-blue eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The car was turning into the Calle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grande on the north side of the plaza when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the driver brought it to a stop at an earnest</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal from a little woman in gray who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing just around the corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, Gaspar?" inquired Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taylor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The driver's answer was forestalled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of the little woman at the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you do, Miss Taylor?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled. In a quick undertone she added</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that caused Miss Taylor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept the extended hand. To passers-by</seg><seg type="columnLine">here were two friends pleasantly met.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gaspar at the wheel cocked his ear hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear what was said, but the voices were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched too low for him, and in a language</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two talked in rapid, questioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentences for a brief period. Then fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed another exchange of handshakes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mrs. Isaacs stepped down from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">running-board. At a word from Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taylor the car continued on its way. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was thoughtful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Isaacs crossed over to the renting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agency below the post-office. In ten min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes she was out again on the street. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved back the man who had accompanied</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to the door. He expostulated, defer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence in all his manner, but her negation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">positive, and with a shrug and a bow he</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned inside. These Americans! One</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew not what to expect of them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would walk in the heat of the day to inspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">a residence when an automobile was at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposal. Madre de Dios!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Isaacs walked sedately south on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calle Commercio until she came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">141</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CaUe Dolores, a dozen blocks from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">piaza. She turned west on this, and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scrutinize the houses closely. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were detached, each in its own plat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Finally she paused at No. 140,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew a key from her pocket and let herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. It was the furnished house Walter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brewer had so hurriedly departed from on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tuesday moming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would appear that Mrs. Isaacs' search</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her lost relative was taking on curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">angles of endeavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN AID OF THE CAUSE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T&gt;ILLY SMITH looked up with a broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin when Jimmy entered the legation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Got news for you, sport," he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, you haven't," Jimmy countered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've been speaking with her down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street.

"I forgot to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell Jimmy that Mrs. Ikey was here this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, and slipped away without regis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering. He'll get it first from the old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went out grumbling at himself for</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlooking this extra morsel of legation</seg><seg type="columnLine">news.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy found the portly envoy in excel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent spirits. Good humor played upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow, and peeped from his eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, James, my dear boy, how are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">today?" he caroled. "I was rather expect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing you to drop in and talk over the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cedure of last night. A little sooner, James,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I could have given you a surprise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rubbed his hands and wagged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head with ponderous cunning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A surprise?" said Jimmy innocently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A lady, my boy. One in whom we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all deeply interested."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not Miss Taylor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Herself, James. And, egad, sir, I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring myself to blame Senor Segovia for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his flair in that direction. A beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman! Captivating! As grateful to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye as a--ah--ahumph--young gazelle."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Great Scott! He certainly did fall for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her!" ejaculated Jimmy inwardly. Aloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said: "You have surprised me, sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, I would have imagined, is the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">place Miss Taylor would have ventured in."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A remarkable woman, James. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a treat to visit with her," gabbled Lane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It removed the last doubt I entertained</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her. Would a person who had stolen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">State secret come to the--er--ahumph--</seg><seg type="columnLine">nest, so to speak, in which it was hatched?</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, certainly not. Would the accredited</seg><seg type="columnLine">correspondent of the--what's the maga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Philadelphia North American Gazette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she says."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes, to be sure." Lane scribbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a pad before him. "I know it. Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">the correspondent of that pre-eminent</seg><seg type="columnLine">periodical be guilty of--ah--latrociny, shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">we call it? Most assuredly not!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy stared at him. First Enrique,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now Lane! Could it really be that he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrong? And Ortega--was he, too, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly misled? As he thought back on it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ortega had seemed to waver in the last few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes of his talk with Enrique this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Mr. Lane," he blurted out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm beginning to think that dispatch</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't stolen at all. There's a mistake</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere. Enrique Segovia claims that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it lies with Senor Valera's secretary. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no one else to lay it to, if we eliminate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Taylor, unless, of course, it happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Senor Valera chewed the paper up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed it in a fit of absent-mindedness."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He laughed, but without mirth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lane^&gt;vas silent. He was leaning back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twiddling his thumbs, and smiling, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed to Jimmy, at his own senile</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginings of his late fair visitor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say, Mr. Lane," he persevered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Morales has recalled his dinner invitation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senor Ortega says it means that Kaufman</seg><seg type="columnLine">is going there tonight, and it's my chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get him. But if the dispatch was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen what reason have we to believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there will be a meeting tonight instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday? The situation is beyond me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lane, still smiling, tapped his temple with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long white finger, and spoke. His answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so astonisliingly at variance with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question asked that Jimmy gaped at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She has brains, sir, as well as beauty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is why she came--the act of unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">innocence walking on the edge of the mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">without fear of harm. No one but a beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful woman with brains would dare the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might destroy her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy was sensible of the contradiction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the minister's words, and a variety of</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressions succeeded one another on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. But he said nothing. Lane was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, he saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I ENJOYED it immensely, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">call," Lane continued. "I am still</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoying it. She approached me on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my blind side--oh, it was rarely done, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetly as a child at play with its doll!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am letting you see, James, as I have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt you have already seen, that John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry Lane is a poor fool for vanity, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">delights in incense burned at his feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay. It is only in a moment such as this</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I will confess my weakness--when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been properly made aware of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Oh why should the spirit of mortal be</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud,' when teetoodledum, teetoodledow--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or however it goes. Perhaps you can sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply it, James. But no matter; I did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Flag</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">143</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Heaven help me, bathe in that lovely</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature's homage--and she went away in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moral certainty that I had not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remotest suspicion of her object in coming."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Hon. John Henry sat up in his chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chuckled at the sport he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">having with his young friend. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaved a huge sigh of restored confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his own judgment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You had me going, sir. I didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you were coming out," he acknowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged with a grin. "Then you do believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Miss Taylor stole the paper?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did I not say that her call removed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last doubt?" replied the minister, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinkling. He turned serious. "James, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">has helped our--er--your plans, if I'm not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in error. The woman thinks now that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">copy has not been missed, and they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceed in this assurance. You can depend</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it that Herr Kaufman has the dispatch</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his possession, and will act quickly. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, I can say-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy waited for him to go on, but Lane</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have become absorbed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for his box of cigars. It was not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usual drawer. He found it shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help yourself, James," he invited. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">need something for my nerves after what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been through this morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes were twinkling again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the way, sir," Jimmy said when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lighted up, "another woman has come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to (own who has got me guessing a little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She's at the Europa, registered as Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rebecca Isaacs of New York."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lane glanced at him, and puffed out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud of smoke. He said negligently:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mrs. Isaacs? Oh, yes. I've had a call</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her. She's in trouble. Hunting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friend. I was sorry, but I could see no</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to aid her. What has she done to</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion remark, this Mrs. Isaacs? She</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be an inoffensive little soul."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy related the series of incidents</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had come under his notice. As he did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized how trivial they really seemed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It does sound rather silly, sir," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessed. "If it wasn't for that roof business</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't suppose I'd have given her a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. That looked a little queer to me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lane nodded, but offered no comment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy drew on his cigar a while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hang it," he volleyed out all at once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm stumped again!" He informed Lane</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly of the anonymous note to Ortega,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Enrique's belief that Mary Taylor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had sent it. "If she did," he concluded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we are wrong about the dispatch. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't help Kaufman with one hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strike him with the other. It's not in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reason."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," said Lane laconically, "it isn't."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not appear to be greatly surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the news of the wireless, possibly because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had come to suspect Kaufman of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret means of communication with Arraca.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," decided Jimmy, "I'm not going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bother my head about it any longer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What I came for principally, sir, was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask you to renew that luncheon invitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other day.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of his trip."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy stared at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, then, perhaps he won't come out</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight!" he cried disappointedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps," Lane smiled, "it is to conceal</seg><seg type="columnLine">his activities. This dispatch means work</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him. His wireless, James, will be busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe it won't," declared Jimmy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much relieved. "Segovia is going to attend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that. And that brings me to a favor</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wish to ask. Segovia was to drive my car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he is assigned to other work I want to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy Smith. I may want to use him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The American minister threw up both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.

"We are on</seg><seg type="columnLine">neutral ground.

"President Hurango is giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it, and so can you. Anyway, Billy Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">is gone. He's sick. I told him he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mr. Whittaker sent him home. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't be around till Monday, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">needn't know what he's doing hi the mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The harassed envoy had risen and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">144</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">striding about the room in a stew of per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexity. But it was subsiding; he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see his way out. He brought up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk as Jimmy finished, and said with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">severity his'eyes belied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Smith is discharged--ah--ahumph--</seg><seg type="columnLine">resigned, I should say.

He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The secretary gulped.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took note of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy smiled at the picture that pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor Lane! She must have bored him</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He had his compensation later," giggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy. "Peaches and cream. Oh, boy!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">They talked on for a while, gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">running down until finally they lapsed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hushed companionship of waiting. Ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock had rung out from La Caridad long</seg><seg type="columnLine">since. Now it struck eleven. Billy re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked on it lazily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sounds like some big old buoy bell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A correlation of ideas brought to Jimmy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind a thing he had forgotten to mention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Billy. He said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Washington is sending us a warship</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Colon. Lane got word this noon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">after you'd gone. The Lincoln, Lieutenant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norris in command. Know it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, gosh!" groaned Billy. "That old</seg><seg type="columnLine">tub? It's a single-screw converted gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. A few four-inch rifles and some six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounders. You can squeeze ten knots out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her if you don't care if she falls apart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why didn't they send something with heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will get to Puerto Mono in time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep Peralta from landing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pish!" snorted Billy. "But we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry. It's Popper Kaufman we're after.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If we get him Peralta will blow up with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own gas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are forgetting something," Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">said soberly. "We may blow up instead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We haven't any cinch on this job we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">undertaken."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They heard hurried steps in the hall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some one rapped on the door. Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped to his feet, but Jimmy was before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and opened to the messenger, Mr-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ricardo Gomez. It was the clerk's "night</seg><seg type="columnLine">on." He tumbled out his words breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I come myself, Mr. Perree--d todo correr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is urgent.

He would see you, sir, Mr. Perree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A car it attends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's a mess!" exclaimed Billy. "We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">can't-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy shut him off with a peremptory</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture.

Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">even here certain spiritual slackers turn a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deaf ear to the voice of duty, causing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good fathers to labor mightily in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to set these wayward feet upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All of which brings us finally to the affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of old man Polyte Greig.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS the feast of All Saints</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, in the words of Landry folk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man Polyte was "at it again."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood upon the porch of the coffee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, his body flattened out against one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the broad, supporting pillars, his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm rising at regular intervals to the ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">companying kick and crash of his ancient,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy revolver. Outside, in the live-oak</seg><seg type="columnLine">grove that shaded the village square, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varo brothers wove their ponies in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the protecting tree-trunks, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumped their answering shots into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoing emptiness of the coffee-house porch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside the bar such unfortunate patrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">as had been cut off from an escape to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear, crouched low in their comers, voicing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a general complaint that old man Polyte</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have chosen the pillar in line with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open front door. And from behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar itself came a wail of anguish as Savoy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proprietor, hearkened to the havoc</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought by stray bullets amid his carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged bottles and glassware.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The origin of the trouble dated back some</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years before. Then there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">three Varo brothers, Paul, Jules and Bebe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Following a quarrel between old man Polyte</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Paul the number had been reduced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. This should have ended the affair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially as the grand jury in the near-by</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of Mouton had returned a verdict of</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-defense in old man Polyte's favor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The remaining Varos, however, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissatisfied with this verdict. Hence there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had developed a species of guerilla warfare</seg><seg type="columnLine">involving numerous pitched battles, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them staged at Landry. Also, since your</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cajun dearly loves a fight, there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">no attempt at interference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They were something to look forward to,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these clashes that occurred whenever the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varos rode in for a feast-day. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of unexpectedness about them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fascinating. The Varos chose no par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular time for their onslaughts. It might</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Trail at Landry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">147</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be morning, or noon, or the edge of twilight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a thudding of hoofs and a shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of profane challenges would announce their</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival. Then old man Polyte would arise</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his interminable euchre to bang away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his venerable Colt until such time as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Varos chose to take their departure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, whereas these combats might ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear to possess a certain inequality in point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of numbers, this inequality was made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for by the mode of attack. For if old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polyte fought one man against two, he also</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought on his feet with his weapon at rest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his opponents sought such meager</seg><seg type="columnLine">results as could be obtained from the backs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their wildly cavorting ponies. Indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if there existed an advantage, this advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage was probably on the side of old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polyte. At all events it was considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair fight at Landry, which was enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thanks to this method of warfare, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">combatants had thus far emerged un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scathed, or at most with trifling wounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was held, however, that such a condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not prevail forever. Sooner or later</seg><seg type="columnLine">a serious injury or even a death would</seg><seg type="columnLine">occur, invoking the law at Mouton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly the present affair was fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed with especial interest by such of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants and visitors as were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear, or safely out of range. They watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the intent yet pensive air of folk who</seg><seg type="columnLine">await the curtain upon some well-known</seg><seg type="columnLine">and long-cherished drama.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time the conflict ran true to form.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shouting, whipping, firing, the Varos dodged</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the grove amid the frenzied shying</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bridle-snapping of the various teams</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were hitched about them. From his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronghold old man Polyte replied delib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erately and mechanically, as one who per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms an oft-repeated public duty. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did he so much as flinch when an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-aimed shot smacked into the pillar</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. They built well at Landry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inside the hollow square was a sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porting round of solid cypress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The watchers, observing this well-ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">procedure, took heart of grace. Perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, the next feast-day would not lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">its usual excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was precisely at this moment that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-dreaded catastrophe occurred. Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired the shot, whether Jules or Bebe Varo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was never determined. It was only known</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the bullet struck an edge of the pillar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, by some abominable freak of luck,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> glanced off and around to enter the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its lone defender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a grunt of pain, old man Polyte</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped his weapon and swung out to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the porch. Here he stood for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, fumbling at his chest, his expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion changing Trom vague uncertainty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled realization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Behold, I am killed," he announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, all of a sudden, he collapsed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumping over in a heap upon the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the Varos, so great was their sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise, that they would have proven easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey for any who might have wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehend them. But there was no estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished law at Landry, and so, having re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered themselves, the brothers wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and loped rapidly out of town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL this time Pere Martain, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cure of Landry, had been looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">on from his churchyard beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">live-oak grove. He was a small man, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">old and fragile, yet in his pale, quiet eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">there shone a light of unconquerable cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age and determination. With the departure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Varos and the surging forward of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd, he too hurried across the square.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the coffee-house he found all in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion. Men hurried this way and that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling for a doctor, a priest; while others</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizing the gravity of the affair, set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to inform the authorities at Mouton. Push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his way through the excited throng</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the porch, Pere Martain entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar and bent over the wounded man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At sight of him old man Polyte moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is all right, Mon Pere," said he in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low, stubborn voice. "I will go as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lived. I am not one for a death-bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The priest made a gesture of impatience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do not be ridiculous, Hippolyte," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproved. "I am here first'to inquire into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seriousness of your wound. When that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is determined it will be time to speak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-bed conversions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Pere Martain bent to his task,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the crowd looked on with respectful</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention. He knew something of wounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this little priest, who had been chaplain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vigilantes during the bitter days of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reconstruction. Until the doctor arrived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">148</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and most probably afterward, his verdict</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be accepted as final.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is only the shoulder, and high up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, Ilippolyte," he now announced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thus you are denied your desire for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">impenitent end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having made his point, Pere Martain</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not linger. At once he departed out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, where there closed in upon him cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of the inhabitants who sought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prolong the fast-waning excitement by re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counting the affair to each unfortunate who</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened along. Thus Pere Martain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to submit himself to a personally</seg><seg type="columnLine">conducted tour of the scene, which began</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the exact spot occupied by old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polyte behind the pillar, and ended with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the depression made by his fallen body</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid the rank grass at the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was while exhibiting this depression</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Prejean, the baker, made a discovery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catching a metallic glint beneath one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grass tufts, he drew forth a small, flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tish object, which he held up between a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb and forefinger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See, it is Polyte's saint," he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Evidently it fell from his pocket when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were carrying him inside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this Pere Martain exhibited an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est that had been wholly lacking before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taking the object, he discovered it to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small, metal case which, when handled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave forth a faint, rattling sound. Next</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening the case, Pere Martain up-ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and dumped into his palm a leaden image.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The image was squat and heavy, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">features suggested a grotesque and impish</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," mused Pere Martain. "Then this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Hippolyte's saint? You are quite sure?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Absolutely," replied Prejean. "It goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him all the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," said the priest, as he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, "this is a matter in which I may well</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night Pere Martain got the image</seg><seg type="columnLine">and studied it long and carefully by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of his lamp. Being more or less of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an authority upon saints, he entertained no</seg><seg type="columnLine">illusion from the first; yet he felt that here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an affair in which he must not trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely to his own judgment. All along</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had struggled with the impiety of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Polyte, and such a thing as a possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage was not to be treated lightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the end Pere Martain determined that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he would take the image to Mouton. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would show it to his friend, Monsieur</seg><seg type="columnLine">Decourt. In his position of notary, Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieur Decourt was supposed to know every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that was worth knowing at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOUR days later Pere Martain</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocketed the image and set out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dilapidated hut that old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polyte occupied upon the edge of the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage. As he trudged along, the good priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered how best he might make use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his discovery. For years he had striven</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this particular sinner, only to abandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as hopeless. Now it appeared that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there might be some chance for his redemp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man who carried about a saint could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be wholly without belief. Inside him</seg><seg type="columnLine">must glow some spark of faith which, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly fanned, would kindle the fires of</seg><seg type="columnLine">devotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus Pere Martain argued with himself;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, as he did so, he remembered that old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Polyte was a master of craft, of subtle</seg><seg type="columnLine">evasion. If given a chance, he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick to smother this spark of belief beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ashes of deceit. He must be ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached warily, and with an abruptness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would defeat his powers of evasion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A victory could be accomplished only</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the element of surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he had expected, Pere Martain found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wounded man well upon the road to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovery. Indeed, he was already propped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the narrow bunk that was nailed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side of his small, stuffy room. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">greetings over, Pere Martain seated . him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self upon an empty box that did duty as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Hippolyte," he began, "and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have not made your expected 'go' after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The sufferer grinned a trifle shamefacedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All the same, it is no fun, this getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bullet in one's body," he replied. "At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first it is like the end of everything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yet, believing this, you refused salva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion?" said the priest sternly. "Hippolyte,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am ashamed of you. Even though you</seg><seg type="columnLine">care nothing for your own soul, you should</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least consider the example you set to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those about you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The listener squirmed uncomfortably,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a dull, harrassed look came into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Trail at Landry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Evidently he was intensely bored.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the use of going over all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, Mon Phre?" he complained. "As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have told you many times, I would be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve if I could. Since I can not, there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more to say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bien," agreed the priest. "If you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not believe, if you can tell me truthfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you have no spark of faith, however</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, there is indeed nothing more to say."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have already said it," returned old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Polyte. "For the rest, how would it</seg><seg type="columnLine">profit me to lie to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pere Martain's moment had come. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very sincere, yet he could not resist a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dramatic flourish as he drew forth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held out the image.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then what have you to say to this?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To his surprise, old man Polyte betrayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no consternation. Rather his expression was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of relief, while in his eyes shone an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted light of recognition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My saint," he exclaimed. "I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, sooner or later, it would come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hght."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then--then you admit that it is yours?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioned Pere Martain uncertainly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And why not, since I have carried it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever since my wife gave it to me?" coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered old man Polyte. "It was this way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My old woman bought the saint at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair at Mouton, and always she treasured</seg><seg type="columnLine">it; for the man told her that with it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come good fortune. When she was dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">she passed it on to me. 'Take it, Polyte,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though you have no faith,' she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Carry it about with you, and it will keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">you from harm.' It was a little thing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have obeyed her wish. That is all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pere Martain sighed resignedly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that, for this once at least, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke the truth. The mystery was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained. There had been no spark after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So, Hippolyte," said he. "I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand. Also I commend you for thus re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membering your dead wife. Perhaps, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said, the image will keep you from</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm." He paused and added hopefully--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps it has done so already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old man Polyte shrugged. He now spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one sure of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My old woman was like that," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied. "As for me, I can only judge by</seg><seg type="columnLine">what has occurred. In that last fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">my saint was with me all the time, yet here</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am struck down by a bullet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what of those other fights?" ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned Pere Martain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old man Polyte shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is this way," said he. "A thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">works, or it does not work. As you see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saint has not worked. If ever it does,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I promise that you will hear from me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pere Martain rose at once. Coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from old man Polyte, this was all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a bargain, Hippolyte," said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. "When the time comes I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold you to it. Wait and you will see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thereupon Pere Martain departed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of mind not altogether unhopeful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had great faith; and, despite his faults,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man Polyte was always as good as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">given word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">roRJI IN SIX days more old man Polyte</seg><seg type="columnLine">jj^Ll was up and about his affairs. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     for these affairs, had they been</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated into two grand divisions, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have comprised pot-hunting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">euchre. When in need of money old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polyte slaughtered the ducks that infested</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake near Landry. At other times he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be found at the second of the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">card-tables in Savoy's coffee-house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon returning to the life of the village</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man Polyte made a most pleasing dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery. He found that, during the brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of his confinement, he had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of hero. Yet this rise in the esteem</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his fellow men appeared to be due less</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his personal achievements than to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">events consequent upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thanks to the supposed gravity of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound, the law had appeared at Landry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sfieriff had ridden out to arrest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varos. Afterward there had been an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigation. During one whole day offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cers had galloped about creating an excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that would be spoken of for months</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come. In brief, Landry had been put</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the map of the parish and, as all</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed, old man Polyte had put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Be it said of old man Polyte that he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most of his opportunity. Where another</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have boasted his way into speedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">disfavor, he preserved a most gratifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">and profitable silence. Upon being ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned as to his now historic, "Behold, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am killed," he merely shrugged, as one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would say, "That is my affair."</seg><seg type="columnLine">150</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following which the inhabitants attrib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uted to him a most amazing foresight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is a keen one, that Polyte," they</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Whether he imagined himself killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not, he saw and grasped the opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">that has made us prominent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this old man Polyte's position was</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure. Finding both friends and credit at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coffee-house, he established himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">permanently at the second of the two card-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables, leaving the ducks to fly unmolested</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the marshes of the lake. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of peace for the former hunter, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">period unmarred by any bothersome de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails of finance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If he won at his euchre, he was that much</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. If he lost, he merely gave his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends a chance to further expound the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauties of civic gratitude. As for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinks--just now old man Polyte's pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence meant business. So long as this con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition prevailed, Savoy would continue to</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet for all this, old man Polyte was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">long in finding the inevitable fly in the oint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of his content. Or rather, it was two</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies, personified by the brothers Varo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following old man Polyte's recovery, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">authorities had dealt promptly with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varos. Also they had dealt severely. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps the authorities felt that they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricked into making a great deal of fuss</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a very ordinary brawl. Perhaps they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were simply wearied by the continued law-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness at Landry. Be this as it may, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentenced the Varos to six months' work</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the public roads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now to the Varos this sentence was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">supportable. Far more would they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">preferred the penitentiary or even the gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows. In that event their punishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have partaken of the heroic. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">their friends they would have appeared as</seg><seg type="columnLine">martyrs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But six months of shoveling ahead of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball and chain! It was as ridiculous as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was disgraceful. They had shot a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were treated like chicken-thieves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, strangely enough, the Varos bore no</seg><seg type="columnLine">resentment against those responsible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their degradation. They placed the blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly upon the aged shoulders of old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polyte. It was all his fault, they declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He should have died, as he said he would,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or at least have made a poor recovery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they would have been punished in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner befitting their endeavors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, thanks to a merciful Providence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter was not past mending, as old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polyte should presently learn. They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">get him the moment they were out again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of which, being duly reported at Lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry, caused old man Polyte to enter upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of uncomfortable reflection. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, he consoled himself with the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that six months was a long time, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the game of "getting" was one at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">three could play as well as two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the days slipped by while the ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinner prospered, a worse example than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever before. So Pere Martain waited, grip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping hard to his faith, assuring himself that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the event of success, his victory must</seg><seg type="columnLine">now be all the greater. So the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratitude grew worn and threadbare as, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">given time, public gratitude always will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, one day when old man Polyte sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to his euchre, the end arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One moment, Polyte," said the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the table. "Have you any money?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Otherwise, there is no place for you. Already</seg><seg type="columnLine">you owe us more than we can afford."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little later, upon the demand of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, Savoy replied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This time, yes, Polyte. But afterward</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must pay. I have worn out no less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than two pencils in keeping your score."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old man Polyte saw and understood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also he accepted with good grace. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a good time, and he knew that good</seg><seg type="columnLine">times could not last forever. Besides, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Friday--always an unlucky day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night old man Polyte cleaned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge muzzle-loader, and took count of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder and shot. Daybreak found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind his favorite blind, far out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the marsh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus old man Polyte missed a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling piece of news that was brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in by the first early arrivals at the coffee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. This news came from Mouton, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned the Varos. The previous after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon they had overpowered their guard and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having taken his pistol, had escaped; pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumably into the impenetrable cypress</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp that encircled the parish upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT HAD been a good hunt, and old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Polyte was satisfied. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bagged a nice bunch of duck and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">during a slack in the flight shortly after sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise, he had managed to slip aside to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Trail at Landry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">near-by burn, and gather in quite a respect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able string of snipe. Therefore, shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">after noon, he decided that, for several rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons, he would be justified in calling it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To begin with he had hunted the farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">marsh, which involved not only the tramp</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his boat, but a long row across the lake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he must dispose of his game. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor luck, there might be no euchre before</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. However, the next day was Sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, and Sundays were always long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant at the coffee-house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It lacked but a little of two o'clock when</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man Polyte broke through the marsh</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim at the point where he had left his boat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The going had been bad, and the long string</seg><seg type="columnLine">of game had become an intolerable burden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he pushed off, old man Polyte wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had a pirogue instead of his clumsy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy skiff. But pirogues held little, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were most capricious in the matter of over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning. Also the waters of the lake were</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and deep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was shortly after he had left the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had settled down to a steady pull that</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man Polyte saw a pirogue slip out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank a short distance above his starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Two men were in the pirogue and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they paddled swiftly out, they held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">course that would bring them directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">athwart the path of the skiff. Observing</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, old man Polyte rested his oars in</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipation of some friendly demand or</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When it was still quite a distance off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirogue halted abruptly, and a voice shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a challenge across the intervening stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water. It was a slow, unsteady voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick with suppressed excitement and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">too liberal indulgence in stolen brandy, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man Polyte had little difficulty in recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nizing it as the voice of Bebe Varo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment old man Polyte was over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come by his absolute amazement. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only falter weakly in reply--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so--and so--you are out again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you see," came back the voice. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are on our way to safety, but first there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your little account to settle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To this there seemed but one logical</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply. Snatching his gun, old man Polyte</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptied both barrels at the speaker. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">intentions were good, but his opponents</seg><seg type="columnLine">had chosen their distance carefully. Save</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a wild scatter of water several yards out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his mark, old man Polyte found that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he had only wasted two charges of his wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully diminished powder and shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Varos took their own good time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">answering him. Indeed, so long was B6b£</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varo in steadying himself and aiming his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol that old man Polyte had a brief hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his enemies had run out of shells and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were merely trying to scare him. But when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment later the bullet came whining</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the skiff old man Polyte ducked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered his situation. He was out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged, and his enemies had the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon before them. The outlook was</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything but encouraging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After a second shot which splintered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skiff's rail, old man Polyte seized his oars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rowed blindly out toward the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lake. The Varos followed leisurely</seg><seg type="columnLine">until, realizing the hoplessness of his flight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fugitive came to rest again. Thereupon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Varos followed their former tactics, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time it was Jules who shot, his bullets</seg><seg type="columnLine">going wider than those of the more accurate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bebe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From this old man Polyte deducted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his enemies had but a single weapon be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them, yet the discovery brought him</seg><seg type="columnLine">little comfort. Evidently they were well</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplied with shells, and one pistol was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amply sufficient for their purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the intervals between ducking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodging below the skiff edge, old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polyte emptied his gun twice in the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the pirogue. He did this aimlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and half-heartedly, more from the desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be doing something than for any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason. Then, finding himself reduced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bare four loads, he crouched low and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consider his plight to its final detail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was in a tight place and, so far as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see, there was little prospect of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting out with a whole skin. Any thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a rescue he dismissed at once. The lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wide and lonely, and a chance passer-by</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be allowed to interfere. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varos would see to that. Escape was</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally hopeless. The pirogue could over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haul him without effort and, once across and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the heavy going of the marsh, his oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nents could easily pick him off from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmer footing ashore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True, if he could hold out until after</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunset, he might get away under cover of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness; but this was hardly to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected. Evidently the Varos were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing with him while their pursuers</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoured the swamp. With the coming of</seg><seg type="columnLine">152</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">night they, too, would be faced with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity of escape. Before the light failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would most certainly risk a dash inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead-line. But even the chance of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was remote. Sooner or later they must get</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a lucky shot that would render their</seg><seg type="columnLine">finishing the affair a mere matter of pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dling alongside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next half-hour was the longest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardest that old man Polyte had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. The prospect of violent death</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bad enough, but worst of all was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim silence of the Varos. If they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reviled him, if they had taunted him, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been easier. Then, infuriated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their jeers, he might have achieved a</seg><seg type="columnLine">state where he would have been wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckless of the consequences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, save for their first challenge, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varos hung on sullen and wordless. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps they counted upon the effect of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">muteness. Perhaps they realized that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no light-hearted duel, but a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cold-blooded assassination. At all events</seg><seg type="columnLine">they uttered no heartening gibe or oath, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowering their voices to an indistinct mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mur when they spoke between themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jules, who steadied the pirogue, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally refresh himself from a bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he raised with his free hand. B6be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">displaying a truly remarkable self-denial,</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched never a drop. However, as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken over the shooting entirely, the cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his abstinence was only too plain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for old man Polyte, he could only sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watch for the next attack. Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was squirm, and twist, and flounder, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fusillade was safely over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shortly after three o'clock a bullet grazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fleshy part of old man Polyte's right</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. The wound was trifling, but its sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificance was great. Each time now Bebe</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot closer. Also, emboldened by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">success, the Varos pushed in for a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of several strokes. Firing an experimentary</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot, old man Polyte found that his charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">just managed to rattle lightly against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirogue's side. At this the Varos broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">their long silence with a laugh. Evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end was close at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Realizing this, old man Polyte cast a final,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping glance about the lake. Far away</seg><seg type="columnLine">a'sailboat was tacking close inshore, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved at it frantically. But either the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew misunderstood, or felt no desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">become embroiled in another's quarrel. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat tacked on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, for the first time, old man Polyte</seg><seg type="columnLine">began seriously to consider the question of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a future life. He thought of prayer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered vaguely if it would do any good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he remembered his saint, and a flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sardonic humor caused him to withdraw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case and tumble out the image upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">leathery palm. A moment he glared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny figure, answering its grin with a fierce,</seg><seg type="columnLine">malevolent snarl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are a fine saint," he growled. "As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a protector you are no more good than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Beb6's bullets. Bien, you will go where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you belong, overside."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his arm upraised and ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw, old man Polyte had another idea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It now occurred to him that the image was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a bullet in still another way. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, and leaden, and heavy--a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper slug, in fact. If he loaded it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot straight enough, he might get Bebe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Varo. Afterward the rest would be easy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With one eye upon the Varos, old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polyte began to load the empty barrel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun. He worked feverishly, yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took care to put in an extra heavy charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of powder. Next he tinkled down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">image, ramming it home with a thick wad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding of newspaper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His enemies looked on derisively. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only had they moved in to improve their</seg><seg type="columnLine">range. They had also hoped for just this</seg><seg type="columnLine">final expenditure of their victim's ammuni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Of the consequences they had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest fear. They knew that, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man Polyte been possessed of anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavier than birdshot he would have used</seg><seg type="columnLine">it at the start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His loading finished, old man Polyte</seg><seg type="columnLine">leveled his gun, steadying it upon the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the skiff. Very carefully he shifted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel until it covered a spot directly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of Bebe Varo's chest. Then, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pulled, he invoked the image, pleading</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it in a muffled undertone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, Saint, come," he muttered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You can do it if you will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the report Bebe Varo jerked suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his knees. There he swung for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, uttering a strange, guttural cry that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not unlike the croak of a frog. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pitched forward, capsizing the pirogue</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a smother of icy water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This much old man Polyte saw as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched his oars. An instant later, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he straightened up again, Bebe Varo was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. Jules, shivering and gasping, pawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Trail at Landry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">153</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately at the slimy, bobbing bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the overturned pirogue. He was so close</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, had he wished to, the watcher could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have reached him by shoving out an oar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good saint," murmured old man Polyte</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he picked up his gun. And, while cocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, "My old woman was right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Emulating the Varos, he took his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">good time with the second barrel. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, under the circumstances, the least he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do was to make a good job of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT NINE o'clock the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning old man Polyte knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Pere Martain's front door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his eyes there was a furtive, hunted look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet the outthrust of his lean jaw suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stubborn determination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Answering the summons himself, Pere</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martain came out upon the porch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Hippolyte?" said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old man Polyte uncovered, answering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting with a brief downward jerk of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have heard, Mon Pere?" he ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have," answered the priest.

"I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry, Mon Pere. I hope that it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrilege?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Pere Martain felt inclined to smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he betrayed the fact by not so much as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitching of a muscle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it was not sacrilege," he replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Besides there was nothing else to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So," said old man Polyte, his tone hint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at dejection rather than relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Hippolyte?" repeated the priest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time in a voice that could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">denied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There fell a pause during which old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Polyte was swayed by indecision. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him lay the coffee-house with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth, its snugness, its never-ending good</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheer. There he would be more of a hero</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever. A seat of honor awaited him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second of the three card-tables. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">front was the church with its cold interior,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">its hard kneeling benches, its long, scourging</seg><seg type="columnLine">sermons that were delivered against just</seg><seg type="columnLine">such sinners as himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old man Polyte's look was piteous.

"As be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, you will find me as good as my word."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A LITTLE later, after the ringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the second bell, Pere Martain</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood watching as the last of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">congregation entered his church.

Kirk Morton, the coxswain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood with his hands on the steering wheel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes on the dancing needle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compass, as he guided the launch through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ghostly vapor which shut the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat and its crew of five into a world apart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outside on the boat's small deck in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowman's place Singleton Smith, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently known as "Hobo" Smith, balanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself on bare widespread toes, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boat-hook with one hand, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch's canopy with the other, while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered forward into the gray wall ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the thoughts of these two men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">little taken up with their work. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">closeness to one another, despite the duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand, was almost an overwhelming</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritant. Kirk Morton was a master hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wheel of the steam-launch--nick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">named the "Jumping Jack"--and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought her out when waves threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drown the fire by way of the smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">stack; and maneuvered alongside the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">when an error of an ounce of pressure on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wheel, or a second of time, would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed her like an egg against the side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But coupled with this expertness was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain habit of smuggling aboard a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bottles of native drink for the use;of</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and friends. This morning, on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">account of it, he had been compelled to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a relief bowman, and as usual, Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been detailed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't you give me some one else, sir?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he complained to the officer of the deck as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cargo was loaded. "This fellow's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">good." And the officer had looked at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly without reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the dog, too?" grumbled Morton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing to the first division's mascot</seg><seg type="columnLine">already curled up on one of the boxes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern sheets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said the officer in a tone which</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant that Morton had gone as far as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared. "Shove off and let's hear no more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it was that Kirk Morton not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried Hobo Smith, but Smith's dog, Arab,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a full-grown shaggy Airedale, whose home</seg><seg type="columnLine">from puppyhood had been the forecastle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Glouster, and whose friends were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith's friends in the exact ratio of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">relationship, for true to his breed, Arab</seg><seg type="columnLine">was loyal and Smith was master supreme.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lay now between Smith's widespread feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his head on his paws, and his alert</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown eyes searching the fog bank ahead with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every acute instinct. Smith raised one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet and stroked across the shaggy head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Arab smiled up at him with a wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unconscious of the obtrusion, the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tail settled back across Kirk Morton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the compass, and with an exclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of anger, he struck down across it</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruelly with the hard edge of his open hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had expected a yelp of pain, but Arab</seg><seg type="columnLine">168</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">did not cry out. Instead, he reversed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly, and his long-jawed, wicked muzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in Morton's face. The dog knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">his enemies as well as his friends, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips were drawn back from his white keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth, and his soft brown eyes had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright points of yellow flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morton jumped back as Smith's restrain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hand was laid on Arab. One vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap of the jaws had come uncomfortably</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd better hold him," he told Smith,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned to the fireman behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Give me that short slice bar. I'll fix this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-pup so he won't be so anxious to take a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bite out of a fellow. What he needs is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few manners."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let the dog alone," said Smith, leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and putting his head under the canopy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wliat did you want to pinch his tail for?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wasn't hurting you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the hardest things that Arab had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn as he grew to full strength was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his friends, and even his master,</seg><seg type="columnLine">preferred sometimes to fight without help</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him. This was one of the times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith had dragged him back and told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lie on the deck. Waves of hatred surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through him and kept the hair on his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a bristle, but to make doubly sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time he was not to interfere, his master</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to the sternman on the launch--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Keep Arab out of this, will you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At the same time Kirk Morton was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying, as he rang to shut off the engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and climbed out on deck:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll settle this thing now. The dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets a licking, and it just suits me to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">on you." Shut in by the fog, and safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">from interference, it was Morton's oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to show Smith his place. "I'll make</seg><seg type="columnLine">this boat too hot a place for any trimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">upstart to light on, trying to take a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">billet away from him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was Morton's real grievance. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the joke of the ship, a dirty, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">redeemed tramp, and after a bitter struggle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped immeasurably by the Airedale</seg><seg type="columnLine">puppy, he had fought back to manhood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morton's words brought the hot blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Smith's face. It was not his fault that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coxswain was becoming unreliable, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be called a trimmer--an officer's pet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">was deadly insult to any sailor. He took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">step forward with fists clenched, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morton met him with a blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men were evenly matched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">size, but Morton had the advantage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">having his back to the canopy, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively secure footing of the widest</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of the small deck, while Smith had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to balance himself further forward, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">one step either way or behind him would</seg><seg type="columnLine">put him overboard. Thus it was that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not well dodge Morton's blow, so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">parried and clenched to keep from being</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced off the deck. Straining and whirling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked in each other's arms, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled over Smith's discarded boat-hook</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell to the deck, Morton on top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arab whimpered under the restraining</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand of the sternman, but knew that until</seg><seg type="columnLine">his master called him, he must keep out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a mighty heave Smith strained up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to get the advantage, and the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled back to the wide part of the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">just over the steering wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out, you two!" yelled "Fatty"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walters, the engineer, and made a frantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">grab for the compass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was too late. The instrument was</seg><seg type="columnLine">upset, rolled to the side of the boat, and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">overboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several precious seconds they con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued struggling while Walters secured a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat-hook, and made ineffectual jabs which</seg><seg type="columnLine">only succeeded in turning the compass over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sinking it lower in the water, as still</seg><seg type="columnLine">alloat in its small wooden box, it bobbed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reach and disappeared in the fog, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch was still going ahead of its mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cut it out!" appealed the engineer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning his boat-hook on the fighting men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You've kicked the compass overboard!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the full meaning of the loss gaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">a place in their wrought up minds, Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Morton sat up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll float," said Morton between pants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he scrambled back into the cockpit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang for full speed.

But this bay was</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided by a point of land from a smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, which had only a rude cluster of native</seg><seg type="columnLine">huts on its protected shore-line, but which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still in command of the revolutionists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sides of this bay were mountainous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thick-grown with jungle vegetation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after a couple of attacks when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing force had found the houses deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by all except the women and children, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors had adopted the easier policy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting the remnants of revolutionary bands</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven from the larger town gather there</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmolested to grow tired of the unequal</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle and return to peaceful pursuits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut off as they were from all supplies, par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly ammunition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Kirk Morton knew that the blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the loss of the compass would rest on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, even though it had been Smith's foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had sent it overboard, for he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge and had started the fight, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped to have this offset somewhat if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could deliver his cargo without delay, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he meant to take a chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">After a time Smith spoke again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was standing as far forward as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance himself, peering intently ahead, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Airedale stood at his side with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle and nerve alert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It don't sound right," he said, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the anger which leaped over him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Morton's sneer, he continued, "we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be out of luck if we hit the upper bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of the one we control. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shore is steeper on that side, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make the engine sounds different."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other men of the crew were interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Morton was not. and Smith kept on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Look at the dog.

His first warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the seriousness of the boat's danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seeing Hobo Smith and Arab as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on the bow go plunging forward over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, as the boat's keel scraped on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first outlying branches of a coral reef, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a sudden stop among the spongy</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping mass, being not seriously damaged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost on an even keel, but stuck hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Kirk Morton in a moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic did a very foolish thing. He ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineer to back her at full speed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the continued thrash of the screw in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">ineffectual attempt to pull the boat off</seg><seg type="columnLine">made noise enough to be heard on the close-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying shore, and advertised that the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pull the whistle cord," advised Smith.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps the ship will hear us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll lie still and see where we are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">first," objected Morton. "Who knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether we've hit the upper bay or not?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had dropped his voice to a hoarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper, and continued: "There's been too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much talking in the boat. Keep quiet, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morton was so anxious to discount any</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion of Smith's that his own judgment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was warped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of ten minutes the engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered a protest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The tide's going out, and we're getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck harder every minute. The fog looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it's good for a week. Let's do some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Morton shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fellows give me a pain," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If we're in the upper bay, blowing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle will only bring the rebels down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and if we're on our side, we will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at for a bunch of boobs. Be game</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stick it out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus appealed to, the engineer gave up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went back to wiping his engine with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of waste.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep that dog quiet, or choke him,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered Morton, as Arab strained forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the bow with a low growl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dog's keen ears had caught the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a stealthy oar, and fifty yards in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">170</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of them the ghostly shape of a native</seg><seg type="columnLine">dugout appeared. After being challenged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and allowed to advance under cover of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew's revolvers, the boat contained only</seg><seg type="columnLine">two harmless-appearing native women with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scanty assortment of fruit, which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">held up for sale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just like I told you," said Morton</seg><seg type="columnLine">with assurance. "We've hit shore some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where inside our own bay, and you fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">all excited, wanting to blow the whistle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raise Ned generally!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then with signs and his scanty supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">native jargon, he bought some of the fruit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked that help be sent out from shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pull the boat of!. The black beady eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two women took in every detail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the boat's predicament, and the nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its cargo, while they shrugged and chat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered and seemed to try to make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morton's instructions. Then abruptly they</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared in the fog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morion was well pleased with himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There seemed a good chance now of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat off the reef and the cargo safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore without having to ask for help, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its embarrassing explanations, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. But the rest of the crew were not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">optimistic. Smith at least was uneasy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Arab gave almost constant signs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of enemies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Smells some dog ashore," said Morton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Smith did not answer the thrust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Arab had run to the other end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat away from shore, and seemed puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disturbed. As they watched, from near</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hand in the fog bank came a dozen rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots, and two of the bullets went through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the launch's canopy. A few seconds after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward from the other side of the boat, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">further off, came a like fusillade of shots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're all around us!" said Fatty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walters, as he and the fireman strapped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their revolver belts and crouched down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waist of the boat. The other members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crew were already armed. "Guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's no argument now about where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are, or what we're up against."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll hear the shots out on the ship,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Morton hopefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a bum guesser," said the engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neer. "Get busy with the whistle cord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like you should have long ago. Firing don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean anything to the ship. Somebody is</seg><seg type="columnLine">always doing a little shooting on shore."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith and Arab had taken their places</seg><seg type="columnLine">for defense in the stern of the boat behind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the ammunition cases with Jimmy Wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sternman, while the coxswain's place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Morton took the whistle cord to</seg><seg type="columnLine">commence his belated signaling, the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the attacking canoes was so close in to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bow that he had to let go and crouch</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cockpit again as he emptied his</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver to repel boarders. Two natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with rifles fired rapidly from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small boat, while their craft was sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly along by two other men at the oars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canoe after canoe did this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The launch crew would catch a fleeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of a boat as it came in sight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished in the fog, and get in a few shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">at each moving target, some of which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hits, while the natives, seeing the larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk of the launch better, riddled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canopy and smokestack and upper sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bullets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of these shots going too high to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">any damage to the boat's crew proved a</seg><seg type="columnLine">luckier chance blow for the attackers than</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it had struck a man, for it took overboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small brass steam whistle secured to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smokestack, and destroyed the launch's</seg><seg type="columnLine">only means of communication with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gloiister. The fireman cursed Morton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubbornness in not using the whistle sooner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he shut off the valve to stop the escaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam, and at the same time the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed tactics and rushed the launch from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sides at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite the best efforts of the defenders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they seemed determined to take the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">by storm, thinking perhaps that the quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">move of the fireman and the hiss of steam</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant disaster. But at close range the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly automatics of the five sailors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">terribly effective, as they stood up at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">places and emptied the revolvers as swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they could push in the fresh clips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE attack collapsed, but not until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the defenders had paid their toll, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. Jimmy Wood had a bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the left shoulder, Morton had a nasty</seg><seg type="columnLine">head wound from a splinter of the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">planking, and a bullet had plowed across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineer's cheek in a deep, painful</seg><seg type="columnLine">furrow. Smith and the fireman had es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't want many more like that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Walters, as he sank wearily into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat by the engine, and let the fireman tie</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a first-aid bandage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Off The Course</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">171</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith was busy with Wood, while Morton</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to bandage his own wound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The ship's bound to miss us and send</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rescue party," said the fireman hopefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," answered the pessimistic engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neer. "She'll wait an hour at least, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">report from shore, and then she'll wireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">in.

"Maybe they could pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shots out, now that it's quiet again."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a bright scheme," said Morton</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarcastically. "What made it take you</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long to think of it? But jar your brains</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little. At three miles the sound would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be mighty faint, even if they caught it at all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we would have to repeat it over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, and not be interrupted by any shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">from another point while we were doing it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, you know," he continued, making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation childishly simple, so that Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get the full back-kick from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blunder, "even if the stern sheets is full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ammunition, you don't see any rifles</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard, do you? And all the revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition we have is what's left in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">belts. Any more brilliant suggestions?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A soft bump against the launch's side</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted further talk. The men leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the side with pistols read)', but only</seg><seg type="columnLine">an empty native boat had bumped along-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. It was a third full of water and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-stained thwarts gave evidence of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't think they would tackle it again</seg><seg type="columnLine">for awhile," said Morton with relief, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped his automatic back into its holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I remember that boat," said the fireman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the dugout began to drift away, "because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was such a small one.

They got in close</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Jimmy Wood got them both before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith took a boat-hook and pulled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft alongside. The boat seemed un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">damaged, and this discovery had suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plan. He ignored Morton's growl to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat alone, and turned to the fireman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What do you use for a bailer?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What're you up to?" challenged Morton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait and see," said Smith, turning on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him furiously.

What</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coward is thinking of is a chance to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with a whole skin himself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith had straightened up, his task</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished, and heard the last remark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You go then," he offered Morton, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining the hot words which came to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, but leaving his fists clenched. "Can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see that if we don't use this chance to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">for help it means not only death to us, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dozens of our shipmates if the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture the ammunition? Who goes doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make any difference, just so somebody</seg><seg type="columnLine">does go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His earnestness had an effect on Morton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who answered sullenly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The chances are better here. They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure to get anybody that makes a dash for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. Your best chance is to stay and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight it out with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll go, then," said Smith, as he un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped his ammunition belt, and handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over. "I'll keep what's in the gun,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then giving the word to the eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">Airedale, who jumped down beside him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">172</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith took up the paddle, and shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently off into the gray wall of fog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In half a dozen strokes the launch had</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared, and paddling silently Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed in obliquely toward shore. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan was to let the shore-line guide him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer point, and from there head for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship, letting the run of waves outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">determine his general direction, and hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this means to strike somewhere near</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to hear some sound from her, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the striking of the bell, or the calling of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">order. Watching for a glimpse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep sandy beach, or the faint outline of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree or shrub, Smith failed to give enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the growing uneasiness of Arab.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A growl warned him, and he looked aside to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the dog's muzzle pointed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the fog came a native canoe, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large one, with four paddlers and two rifle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. They saw Smith even before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw them, and a challenge rang out, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fog had turned both natives and white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man into gray shapes without identity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith was afraid to answer for fear his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice would betray him, and as if he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hear, he kept on obliquely past the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe, but the challenge was repeated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the larger boat moved forward to block</seg><seg type="columnLine">his course. Seeing that discovery was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoidable, Smith opened fire, sending the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six shots from his automatic into the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crowded boat, and then paddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead feverishly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The natives had not been sure that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small boat contained an enemy, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to save their scanty store of ammu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nition, besides not wanting to betray their</seg><seg type="columnLine">position in the ring of boats that encircled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the launch. The heavy revolver fired at</seg><seg type="columnLine">close range killed the rifleman in the bow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who fell forward across the gunwale, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat an ugly list, wounded two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddlers, and so confused and handicapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second rifleman that Smith's boat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearing into the fog before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">free himself from the body of the paddler</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had fallen backward acrpss his legs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">put his weight on the light side of the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep it from capsizing, and fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SMITH was bending low, paddling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all his strength. A bullet came</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the thin side of the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">just above the water's edge, and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">seared his back like the stinging cut of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicious whip. The native, for a rarity,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was a good shot, and only the fog saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith. As he whirled the boat's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a new course to offset the rifleman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">aim, he realized that the man could no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him or the boat, and hurried away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the angry smack of the bullets in the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the spot where he had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The native boat with its dead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded and a hole in the bottom the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man's thumb, where one of Smith's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets had been deflected and tore end</seg><seg type="columnLine">over end instead of boring through, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not give chase, and following the shore-line</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith made the mouth of the bay and</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed for the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately for his cockle-shell, the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">was smooth, there only being enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion in the gentle swells to give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. There was no wind. The fog</seg><seg type="columnLine">still lay a damp enveloping pall over every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. From his watch Smith knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been away from the launch less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen minutes, and since there had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sound of shots or of a struggle behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he knew that the Jumping Jack with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its crew and cargo was yet safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Roughly, from the point of land to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's position was about two miles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddling steadily Smith took up his muscle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-nerve-trying task. Not only must he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle with all his strength, but to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">his direction he must watch constantly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll of the sea and pay no attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disconcerting influence of the fog. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped to make it in half an hour. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it, he told himself, or it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been better if he had stayed to help in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense of the launch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of fifteen minutes he stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to listen. Weirdly and faintly as if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be imagination, he caught the strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of five bells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're going back to the ship," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the dog. "Do you get me, Arab, old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In answer the dog whined understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, and thrust up his nose to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith's caressing strokes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's the ship, Arab?" said Smith,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an idea coming to him, and the dog ran to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bow and leaned over, letting out a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelp of eagerness. "Good boy!" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith, and repeated, "Back to the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arab, back to the ship!" as he took up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle to commence his work again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crease across his back was beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to burn and stiffen, and from behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">Off The Course</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">173</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shoreward had come an intense outburst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing, but whether from the vicinity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch or from some other point ashore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was unable to determine. Then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a danger which he had not counted on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next native boat in line from the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had run foul of, had rushed in at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of firing, found the disabled boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and followed from where he had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in the fog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not the zigzag course around the shore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, but straight out to the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay to head him off in his dash for the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By chance he had eluded them there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but knowing the direction of the ship, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking that the sailor would now take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight course, they came swiftly after,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being guided finally by the sound of Smith's</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexpert paddling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arab's stiffening bristles and his interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the stem of the boat, warned Smith of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of enemies. Soon he, as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Arab, caught the sound of the pursuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, so close that it was only a question</seg><seg type="columnLine">of minutes until it would be near enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the natives to see him. Smith's only</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to dodge was while still hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fog, and dipping his paddle with as</seg><seg type="columnLine">little noise as possible, he turned abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one side, and after a dozen strokes quit</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddling to listen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The native boat went by so close that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the suck of the paddles and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slap of the bow against the water, and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer hearing him as a guide ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, Smith heard a half-toned order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the native boat stopped also, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the keen ears of its occupants could pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the trail again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith was afraid to paddle, afraid almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move, and Arab stood motionless beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, restrained from all soimd by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">master's stroking hand. His presence gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith a plan of action. With the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his jack-knife he scrawled on the dog's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brass collar, "Help! Launch upper bay,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that done, he bent over and, putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">command and faith and entreaty into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone, whispered softly into Arab's ear--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go to the ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dog seemed bewildered for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so Smith lifted him carefully and placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him over the side into the water. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pointed and again whispered his order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">commandingly, almost harshly, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog with one glance backward to make sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">commenced swimming ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go to the ship," repeated Smith with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips, and Arab looked back one more</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to catch his master's hand waving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then-noisily Smith took up the paddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and commenced to row in the other direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Immediately from the fog came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answering swish of water, as the native</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat came after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith knew that free from interference</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dog would make the ship, and he pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">died shoreward long enough to make sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Arab was not discovered before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged again. This time the natives were</seg><seg type="columnLine">close enough to see him. He turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little boat swiftly, and by a desperate effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">regained the shelter of the fog. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives were too close to the ship to risk</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alarm of gun-fire, and preferred a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent method of disposing of the mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith felt this, and with the growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">distress from his wound, knew that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not hope to dodge the larger boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">much longer, so while still hidden, he aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doned the boat, preferring to take his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance by swimming and floating with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tide toward the ship, than to fall into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of the natives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To help keep afloat, he took both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat's paddles. He was just in time, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe in the fog bank, he heard the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats scrape together, and the contention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of excited voices. The firing on shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">had broken out afresh. Smith floated on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back, afraid to make strokes for fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the splashing would betray his position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and planned to dive under the surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he heard the boat coming nearer. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Part of the natives wanted to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue the search for the swimmer, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others, stimulated by the shots ashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disgusted with the fruitlessness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their chase, wanted to get back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack on the launch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This faction won out, and Smith heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of a hatchet, as the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small boat was smashed in, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of paddling growing fainter as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat went shoreward. Cautiously he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swam back toward the wrecked boat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a search which left him exhausted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw his tired body across its sunken edge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for though destroyed for the use of a paddle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was enough buoyancy left in the wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep him afloat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">174</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DICK REASONER was seeing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the adjusting of a side-cleaner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage when a moving spot out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fog-wreathed water attracted him.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a bar of the latter, but with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clatter the stranger got to his feet, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight and grave until the notes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">national anthem ceased. I stared at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely comprehending at first. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilians, before the great war, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">insufferable clods in the matter of inatten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion to simple courtesies to the flag and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the national air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Others were on their feet in the motley</seg><seg type="columnLine">assemblage that filled the cafe. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good deal of an American rendezvous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Among them was an officer of the Navy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with him a figure in khaki. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger's eyes rested on these men with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud glow. He made a half-movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">to approach them, then subsided into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair.	^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We said no more of Andrews, but talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">of things nearer to the hour and to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">starved interest. We left the cafe together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as if we were old acquaintances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My irascibility seemed to have vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his dogged friendliness. I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken him to the club, or to my rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a cigar and a liqueur, but he seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in haste. Perhaps 1 only fancied it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his hurry seemed to be stimulated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">an incident at the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A well-dressed Chinese entered as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out, jostling clumsily against us. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked keenly at my companion--in fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stared. Apparently the Chinese fancied</seg><seg type="columnLine">an acquaintance which was not recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the stranger, for he turned away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping hastily into a rickshaw was</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled away into the confusion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. The Chinese called out to a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting in the shadow of the doorway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after a moment of voluble instructions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the cafe, leaving the other to dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the street in the direction taken by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stranger's rickshaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I suppose I spent the remainder of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">evening at the club. At any rate it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">late when I reached my rooms in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">consular building. I stumbled over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">suitcase that stood just inside the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently it had been left there by mistake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it was not mine. It was closed but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not locked, and the catches seemed to invite</seg><seg type="columnLine">examination. Curiosity overwhelmed me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I laid the suitcase open on a table, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a full minute stood whistling before its</seg><seg type="columnLine">contents. It was filled to the brim with</seg><seg type="columnLine">trim packets of Chinese bank-notes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no name on the case, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find no clue to the mystery of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence in my room. Was it unlikely</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this was the four-hundred-thousand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar loot of the man Andrews? Still</seg><seg type="columnLine">further, was it unlikely that my dinner com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion at the cafe was himself this An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drews?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I called my No. i boy. He shuffled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way into the room, blinkingly, and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessed entire ignorance of the suitcase.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He roused all the servants, but they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant likewise. I gave them up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">exasperation. Doubtless some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew all about it, but true to "character"</seg><seg type="columnLine">professed ignorance lest in some way they</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be involved in unpleasantness. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sort of first cousin, I thought, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of suspicion that inspired the pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I pored over the contents of the suit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">case. Four hundred thousand dollars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no doubt after a rough count,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay before me. As I fingered the packets</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began a busy mental process of working</seg><seg type="columnLine">out an explanation. It seemed a reason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able theory: that Andrews and the stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cafe were one and the same. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">could the presence of the suitcase here</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean a sort of repentance, a strange method</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reparation? What was I to infer?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Should I imply, that to me had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">intrusted the task of restoring the loot--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a task that probably might be both dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous and impossible to him? Or had he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other hand, simply put the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my temporary keeping, intending to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it later? Perhaps he was the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a pursuit--perhaps, in danger of capture</seg><seg type="columnLine">or detection, he adopted this fantastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of hiding his booty. In effect, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he made me an accomplice. Should I</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept such a role, or shoidd I return the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money at once to its owners? An inquiry</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the consular service doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Twelve Padlocks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">181</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would discover for me who these owners</seg><seg type="columnLine">were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the whole I was inclined to the belief</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Andrews, repentant, had given me this</seg><seg type="columnLine">wordless, implied invitation to act as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purifier of his conscience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was too late to trouble the consul.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was too late even to carry the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a place of greater security. I deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to sleep with one eye open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceal the suitcase beneath the bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I slept well over so much treasure, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with both eyes shut, it seems. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning I found that even the cord with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had innocently tied the suitcase</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one of my hands had been snipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">without in the least distracting my slumber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As for the suitcase, it was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course I raged at the servants in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorough "foreign-devil" fashion. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">words were such as to express suspicion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The servants grew very sad and patiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">indignant. I even went so far as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">threaten dismissal of them all, a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that did not seem remotely probable</seg><seg type="columnLine">either to me or to them. To dismiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">them undoubtedly would be to get a worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">set of servants; to keep them might</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually be the means of solving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did not appear to me, on reflection,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was anything in particular to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done about the matter. I could only wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">further developments from some source</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other, probably from Andrews. If he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had meant to make me only a temporary</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiver for his loot he would be back again</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it. If he had intended its restoration</seg><seg type="columnLine">I probably would see no more of him. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">that case I was at something approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscience-clear. But if he should return</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanding an accounting of my steward-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, what sort of conviction would my</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation carry? Would he have his</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenge upon me?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not entirely in an easy frame of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that I dined that evening at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed table. The stranger was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">present. Nor did he appear while I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, though I loitered in the uneasy hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seeing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 had begun a stealthy investigation into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth of Andrews' story. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">means at my hand in the consular service</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed likely I should eventually learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remainder of the story of the twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">padlocks. As an afterthought, when I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">returned home that evening, I administered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bribe to the No. i boy. It was not a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">bribe, and I should not have expected a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large return for it. In fact it brought only</seg><seg type="columnLine">another mystery--a pale one, scarcely rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognizable at first as anything but accident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I dressed next morning I found on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my table a large iron key. It was of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old-fashioned character, and bore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious trademark of some English maker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked the room boy about it, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to express only a mild interest. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">either could not or would not venture an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion as to its origin or as to the reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for its being there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doubtless I should have thought no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more about the key if another had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside it when I arose on the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. On the next morning there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a third, and on each succeeding day an</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition, until I had half a pound or so of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clumsy bits of steel and brass cluttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">my table. Once I bundled them up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled them into the courtyard, exasperated</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the mystery they represented. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning I was rewarded by finding them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all back again, with the usual addition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the collection ceased to grow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And of a sudden, cursing myself for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupidity, a solution to the mystery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">keys flashed upon me. I counted them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as I suspected, there were twelve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, then were the keys to the twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">padlocks!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this far and no further would the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution go. I had a daily desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">commit medieval cruelties on my smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">No. x boy, who I felt certain knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to the puzzle. I was torn between</seg><seg type="columnLine">this irritation and an impulse to meet his</seg><seg type="columnLine">undoubted terms--a handsome cumshaw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also I began to fear this crafty servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat. There was somewhere in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this business of the keys and padlocks a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurking menace--perhaps tragedy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My inquiry through the consular service</seg><seg type="columnLine">yielded me nothing. I could not find even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the habitat of the twelve gray merchants</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the iron strong-box. Neither did I</seg><seg type="columnLine">encounter Andrews, nor could I find trace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him among the numerous haunts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men in either the foreign or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese quarters. I found those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew him, but none who had seen him</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the offices of his firm they had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of his arrival from up river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">182</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Doubtless, I thought, he had sailed away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fear might have sped him to this disappear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, but I was inclined to stick to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory of an eleventh-hour repentance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had conceived a certain respect for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could not wholly be discounted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own recital of "Andrews' " moral lapse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE hot season was just coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, and I slipped away for a week</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two into the hills at Mokanshan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When 1 returned 1 had almost forgotten the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery of the twelve keys. I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of it, at least, on the morning I set</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on one of my numerous jade-collecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">excursions into the native city.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds frightfully small, but I'm setting a low esti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate, and the buying power of the rupee in India is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whole heap more than the dollar here.
