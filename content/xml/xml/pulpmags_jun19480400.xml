What is this thing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun reveals?" exclaimed the pygmy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two gunshots in the distance lent ur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent emphasis to N'Geeso's words.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man, naked to the waist, whipped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurching, exhausted mount through the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass. On either side of him ran two</seg><seg type="columnLine">black retainers, stumbling and reeling as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fought to keep their balance by hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to their master's saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the three ran a losing race, for be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind them like a hunger maddened dog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack, eight black warriors coursed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious, unfaltering speed. A glance at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors, oiled and painted for battle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their yellow-plumed headdresses bob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing and leaping, told Ki-Gor that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Ochari from far south of the veldt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was unusual for so small a raiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">party to penetrate this far from its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'Geeso roused his sleeping warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shout, but there was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm in his voice or manner. The eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ochari didn't live who would dare come</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the deadly blowguns of sixteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">pygmies. As his men flung upward from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their sleeping mats, weapons tight-gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ready in their hands, a thin smile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">approval touched N'Geeso's lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed toward the veldt. "The dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gos will catch their prey before they get</seg><seg type="columnLine">this far," he explained, "but it is well to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let them see our numbers in case this</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy kill gives them false ideas of cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must aid them," Ki-Gor declared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his code was not that of the black men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'Geeso's tone was utterly calm. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no use. The horse is done.

Ki-Gor said, and with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out waiting for the pygmy's agreement, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprinted down the slope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'Geeso looked at his men, giving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders a helpless shrug as though to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, "It is foolish, but we must honor Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor." They grinned, not at all displeased</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the chance to throw a scare into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boastful Ochari.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then with a rallying cry, N'Geeso sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly darted into action, skittering down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope like a thrown stone. Pell mell</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him came the fierce little demons</seg><seg type="columnLine">who called him leader and their high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavering yells reached out over the veldt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE white man lashing toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope heard them and his head shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in alarm. His first thought obviously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that a band of Ochari had gotten in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him. But when he saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newcomers were pygmies led by a bronzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant of his own race his whip rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell across his horse with renewed vigor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Ochari heard, too, and realizing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pygmies intended to snatch their prey</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them, they spurted forward in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate drive to make their kill before</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso's men could interfere. Close they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, until two of them were running al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most within spear throw of the horse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">flanks. The white man seemed to go wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fear at the thought of being dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">down so near to safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor saw him suddenly, shockingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise his whip and beat at one of his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainers hanging to his saddle. He rained</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows over the native, trying to free his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse of the exhausted man's weight. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the black screamed with pain he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held on, stumbling and dragging as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">careening mount pulled him along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE OF THE JACKAL PRIESTESS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an excess of rage, the rider leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the saddle and pounded the black with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fists. The horseman was a huge man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with tremendous shoulders and arms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even from a distance, Ki-Gor could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the native shudder under the powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows. Abruptly, the black collapsed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked senseless by the beating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His legs dragged for a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then his hand came away from the saddle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tumbled over and over, his course</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced by tossing grass. The Ochari flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto the fallen black, their spears hammer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a savage rhythm as they ripped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's lips tightened as he sprinted</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the last of the grade. He couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand how any man, even to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, could so brutally throw away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life of another. But his pers'onal feelings</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not lessen his resolve to drive off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ochari.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was on flat ground now, the flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing beat of his long, steel-muscled legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising to an ever higher pitch. In all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle, no man had ever been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal the White Lord's speed in a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">race. He was close to the white man then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see clearly the contorted, fear-torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">face pressed low over the foam-flecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse's head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pull up!" Ki-Gor cried, "Together we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can stand them off!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the man heard, he gave no sign. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything, the brutal rise and fall of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lash speeded up. Ki-Gor felt a spurt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger as he realized the man meant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spur past and leave him to face the blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. The White Lord sheered off, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps slowing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pull up," he roared, "or by the gods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll let them have you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the pygmies coming up behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, Ki-Gor knew that a brief show of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight would suffice to turn the Ochari.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor's threat inspired a strange and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected reaction in the horseman. A bab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble of incoherent curses ripped from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, and he swung his horse straight at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's eyes were ice-grey slits as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the madman meant to ride him down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The White Lord swayed as he ran, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right arm whipping back and up, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shovel-bladed Masai war spear poised for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cast which would tumble the horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the spent animal saved Ki-Gor the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. As it tried to make the abrupt turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">dictated by its master, its trembling legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave way. Horse and rider came down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a turning, twisting heap. And the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been running with one arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped to the saddle screamed in a high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feminine voice and was thrown off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor in that moment received a dou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble shock. As the huge-shouldered rider</seg><seg type="columnLine">dove through the air, the jungle man saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole of his body for the first time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The high grass had previously blocked off</seg><seg type="columnLine">a view of any more than his chest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. The strange horseman was legless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His massive torso ended in two leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the black who screamed was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young girl, her slim, naked body red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slashed where grass and thorn had torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">her during her flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the horseman hit the ground, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">mowed through the grass head first for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good ten yards, grating to a halt almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Ki-Gor's feet. He lay still, his face a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of small cuts, blood streaming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose and mouth. His eyes rolled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his head and he breathed in hard, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsive gasps. His whip remained tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl was lost to view in the grass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but her weak whinnies of fear told Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor she lived. The horse threshed twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay still, its neck broken in the fall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor instantly regretted his harsh words</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the man. A helpless cripple, choking</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fear, couldn't be held as accountable</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a normal man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A yell of triumph went up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ochari.

The two leading blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">split apart, one turning to block away Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor, while the other raced on to slay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious horseman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord wasted no time on</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. The Ochari were a lawless crew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever raiding and plundering weaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribes, heeding no authority but their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce chieftain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the painted warrior came leaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the dead horse, his spear raised for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cast, he got a clear view of the bronzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant hurtling toward him. The black's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes widened as he recognized his foe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise stayed his hand a fraction too</seg><seg type="columnLine">long.

Instead of stabbing with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">razor-sharp Masai spear, he swung it like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a club, smashing it flat against the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's head. The native gave a queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">burbling grunt and fell backward on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffening horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor whirled, grim-faced and cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">judging as he turned the distance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of the other native.

It lifted him off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet and whirled him head over heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE jungle man did not wait to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect of his cast. Two natives he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could handle, but now that he had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knife, the six warriors coming up</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make short work of him. He raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the unconscious white man, lifted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his arms and headed back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pygmies. The man was unexpectedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy, his thick body roped and swollen</seg><seg type="columnLine">with muscles, his arms as large as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">average man's thigh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even in his haste, Ki-Gor was struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the man's ugliness. Every visible inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his body except for his face was cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with tattooing, and his face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted and brutish. His over-sized head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shaved, revealing an oddly pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull. His nose was a predatory beak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes were close-set beneath beetling</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor heard the crunch of dry grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the hurt, exhausted whimpering of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl and- ran toward the sounds. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">came on her so suddenly he almost tripped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was crawling through the grass to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white man's aid. Ki-Gor was amazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ugly brute in his arms could</seg><seg type="columnLine">command such loyalty from the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he saw her, he knew she was too</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weak to run. Since Ki-Gor could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry them both, he decided to stand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to protect them, though he knew how</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless his efforts would be if the Ochari</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued their mad rush. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound now from the pygmies, and since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grass completely swallowed their small</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, he could not judge whether they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were close enough to reach him in time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord dropped the man be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the girl. "Lie still and I'll try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw the Ochari away from you," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he spun and drew his long knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He ran toward the Ochari, cutting off at</seg><seg type="columnLine">an angle to pull them away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple.

Shrilling their rage, the blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung toward him. A spear plunged past</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ear, the whirr of its passage a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A black, his face hideously distorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hate, came at Ki-Gor with long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching bounds. The warrior gripped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear with both hands, braced for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock of the cruel point ripping upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">to disembowel the White Lord. For an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, it appeared the jungle man would</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling himself directly on the point. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a sure target for the black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the White Lord, as soon as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man lunged, twisted wraith-like before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blow.

Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the black was aware he had missed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor rocketed against him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The impact lifted the heavy warrior like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rag doll and threw him back against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear of the man behind him. By the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black screamed, Ki-Gor had cut away</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the side, using the bodies of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">entangled men to block the other four</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives. Only his phenomenal speed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">agility kept him from death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blacks sprayed on either side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and as their spears lifted he knew at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least one of the four casts would be good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE OF THE JACKAL PRIESTESS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">li</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He had occupied them, led them away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hidden couple, but now his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be forfeited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is mine!" snarled a lean, tall war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rior, his eyes gleaming with the knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could not miss.

His legs carried on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their running motion. He fell jerkily into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grass.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ochari had delayed too long, tricked by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the utter silence with which the pygmies</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made their approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tall warriors had no need to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso's men to know they were lost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More than the most deadly poisonous</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake, they feared the venom-tipped darts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pygmies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mercy!" pleaded a grey-faced native,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping to his knees, his spear falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dik-dik deer could not have passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through that ring of trigger-tense pygmies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peace!

Then his mind reverted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tatoga celebration again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Momba-N'gar!" he repeated the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">several times to himself, and on his tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had an ugly sound. "You know, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor, I've heard it said that men fashion</seg><seg type="columnLine">their gods in their own likenesses. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that.

The patient's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition was unchanged, so the jungle Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't disturb Parson.

For all of his scorn of</seg><seg type="columnLine">native juju, queer prickles ran up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his spine. Reason told him it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be, but his eyes saw the stone figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to life. But when the god spoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor immediately knew the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The god spoke the Tatoga tongue with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white man's accents, the same accents</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had tinged the wild curses of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legless horseman on the veldt when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to ride the White Lord down. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">legless man himself was Ki-Gor's enemy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man whose life the White Lord had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to save, whom he had thought tragic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor made no effort then to pierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">the web of treachery spun by the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and his assistants.

In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to impress and frighten the old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftain, the legless man had commanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to fall on his face, not realizing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nanooko's followers would hasten to fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low suit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the legless man grasped his mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take, Ki-Gor leaped over the bodies of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards and sped straight through the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack of grovelling blacks, heading for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle. He moved like an antelope, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet barely seeming to touch the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he strained to gain every last particle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of advantage from the surprise of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ki-Gor escapes!" shrieked the legless</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in an abrupt departure from his god-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like demeanor.

As the blacks came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him, he lowered his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plowed straight through them. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the outer fringe of the crowd and</seg><seg type="columnLine">since he bent low, only those warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">close by could see him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An enraged water buffalo would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck with no more devastation. He put</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head and shoulders into men in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitudes of rising, the shivering power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his charge scattering them to either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Sprawling and kicking as they fell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not knowing what had hit them. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">through all of them then, except for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks who had lingered behind their fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two managed to stand upright in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to see the great-thewed giant hurtling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them. But before they could collect</seg><seg type="columnLine">their senses enough to raise their spears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dove at knee level at the nearest man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fellow beat downward with his dou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled fists, but the leopard swiftness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle man brought him in too fast for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black's slower reflexes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor hit solidly, swinging his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadside as a football blocker does. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">native's legs held firm for a fraction, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spun high, screaming in pain as bone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tendon ripped loose. The White Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit flat on the ground, but the layers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle encasing his chest and belly ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed the rocking blow like shock ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His spread fingers caught the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE OF THE JACKAL PRIESTESS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">before he had ceased sliding. They dug</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, and he whirled himself about, lash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out with his feet at the second black.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man was coming in on him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor's heels exploded in his face. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior's neck snapped with the sudden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive break of dry bamboo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The native catapulted backward, his legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">making loose, wild motions. By the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fell, Ki-Gor had leaped past him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was driving for the trees thirty yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. But brief as the delay had been,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was long enough for the mass of war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors to shed their confusion. They came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in long, bounding leaps across the clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, whipped by their of Momba-N'gar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KI-GOR didn't look back. His ears told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him how close was the race he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">with death. He poured his whole strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the effort of running. A spear ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">past him, then two more. The first arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped dangerously close, its passage a hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn against his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the trees were dead ahead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barbs were spanging into the wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing splinters of bark. Fire touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him twice against his thigh and he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">his luck was running out as bowmen got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the range. He gathered himself in a final</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcanic surge, bounded over the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluster of baobab roots, straining to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the monster tree so the trunk would</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly shield him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He cursed the blacks who had cut away</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brush about their holy place. The wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of liana, bamboo and bramble which or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinarily would have grown there would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have given him safety. Missiles whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air about him, rattled against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches and still he lived to run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he was past the giant cluster of</seg><seg type="columnLine">roots. He spun to the left, turning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring the baobab tree at his back until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could pierce deeper into the forest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With an exultant thrill, he knew that an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other step and he would be safe, for once</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the jungle no man among the Tatoga</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hope to catch him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lifted in the final bound which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would place him beyond reach of the mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siles, and in that fleeting interval, Fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned its face away from him. A heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear caromed against the baobab tree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Traveling at full tilt, it ricocheted, turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sideways in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The haft of the spear, just below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, hit Ki-Gor across the forehead. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit him with the force of a club, ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">viciously for a yard of its smooth-surfaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, and still had force enough to spin</seg><seg type="columnLine">off at a crazy angle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor never knew what hit him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky exploded in his face, disintegrated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dazzling burst of light like a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursting comets. Then abruptly total dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness engulfed him and he went down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nerveless drop of a poled ox. He lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a limp huddle, not hearing the fierce,</seg><seg type="columnLine">elated cry with which the Tatoga marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his was the instinct of a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature, and it was this instinct, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse welling out of bone and heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flesh, which came to the fore now</seg><seg type="columnLine">when all other senses were dormant. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a buck felled by a bullet will come to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet to run again, so did Ki-Gor suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">claw drunkenly to his hands and knees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His mind had no part in the action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instinct cried to him to flee, ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the pain and darkness with a ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible urgency. He reeled up, staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward on rubbery legs. He ran against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tree and fell. He wanted fervently to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie still, to give way to the aching sickness</seg><seg type="columnLine">which engulfed him, but that inner lash</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat him upright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He staggered into a run, sobbing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort, his glassy eyes seeing only vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurs. He drove into and over things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the very act of moving pumped new</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength into him. It was like a night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mare of some horrible, unending chase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward, Ki-Gor was never to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how long he had kept on nor by what</seg><seg type="columnLine">paths he had gone. He had been a wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal blindly seeking escape. His feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thought for him. There was a blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his memory from the time he spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get behind the baobab tree until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next morning when he awakened to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself huddled under a thorn bush in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a narrow, deep ravine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He awoke to the dull throb of pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his head. He lay face down, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was a mass of bruises and aches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He crawled from beneath the bush, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to know where he was, climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the precipitous, difficult wall of the ravine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he reached the top, he was winded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flung himself down to rest. A heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mist that alternately cleared and deepened</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to lay over the area about him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He blinked his eyes, trying to probe</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the fog and identify his surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raised a hand to his aching fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. His fingers touched a great blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crusted welt. It came back then, the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the clearing, his break for freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sudden, crushing blow which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">blotted out everything. Where was he?</seg><seg type="columnLine">How had he gotten here?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strained to penetrate the dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist. And abruptly he realized the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no mist! It was his eyes!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blurred greyness lay entirely within</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own vision!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor sat stone still, and the steady,</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful beat of his heart faltered. Drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">by drop, the poison of fear gathered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat, trickled with acid hotness into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tight-cramped stomach. For the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in his life, the White Lord knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it was to be afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blindness to him meant helplessness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the jungle the helpless swiftly died.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not the thought of his own fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made him afraid. It was thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his beloved mate, Helene, of his pygmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends, and of the countless humble black</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who would know death and torture</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he did not survive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without his sight he could not hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to outwit for long the fanged killers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest, let alone deal with the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">principled adventurer who called himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">Momba-N'gar. By now Helene was held</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner by the legless man, and knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ki-Gor's escape, she would be waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her husband to come to her aid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso, too, if he still lived, would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watching for him, placing his trust in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Lord who had never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to fail a friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought of all that depended on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him brought Ki-Gor to his feet. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he treated the wound on his head that</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey curtain before his eyes would dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipate. He started in search of herbs with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to dress the wound, but panic grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his heart as he stumbled over roots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked into shrubs, moved time after time</seg><seg type="columnLine">into blind alleys of foliage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as the panic grew, he exerted him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self all the more, using sheer physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength to bull his way through the under-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brush. He was like an animal mad with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain. He forgot the reason of his search.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tore and smashed at every obstacle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sweat pouring from him and his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding. And steadily the greyness about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him thickened, shading deeper until sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he was in utter darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shock of that stygian blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him to his senses. He stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands going over his eyes. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that for long, dreadful minutes. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a sound he slowly sank down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest floor, burying his face in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor was completely blind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RUNNERS had gone ahead to prepare</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tatoga for the god's coming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">George Duran, for such was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legless man's better known names, waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">until dusk to make his entry into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kraal. Then, preceded by booming drums,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was borne out of the jungle on Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nanooko's litter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sepah and the chief wizard had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">their work well. Duran's last fears of</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure were swept away by the sight that</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted him. The silent, frightened throng</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blacks took one look at him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-light and flung themselves moaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A wild, brutal joy gripped Duran. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the power he had always dreamed of,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power of a god, and to think that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere chance meeting with that greedy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambitious black wench Sepah had opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door to all this. He had seen her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ochari kraal and by a judicious use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gifts had arranged with her master</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have her sent for his entertainment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By all the devils, she had entertained</seg><seg type="columnLine">him all right, but more than that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed this venture at the very time his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bargaining with the Ochari had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">an impasse. He had thought it prepos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terous at first, but the unscrupulous little</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage had proved her point by taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out to the pens where the male slaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">were kept. The Tatoga men, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">played the part Sepah had coached him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, hailed him as the god, Momba-N'gar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to deliver them from the Ochari.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since the last of his funds had gone for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gifts wasted on the Ochari and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE OF THE JACKAL PRIESTESS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't risk showing his face in any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the port towns, he had decided to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gamble proposed by the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could thank the girl for everything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he were the "thanking kind". But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duran was under no delusions as to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for Sepah's loyalty. She thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had him fooled, but he knew they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were two of a kind. He was the instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which she could gain the wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and power for which she hungered, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gain her ends she would passionately</seg><seg type="columnLine">embrace the devil himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes sought out Sepah where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked ahead of his litter, hungrily fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the sensual sway of hips. The day</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come, he knew, when she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">become dangerous, but until she found</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that he didn't mean to be a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping-stone for a black wench, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">count on her devotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duran's mouth thinned cruelly. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten him out of Tom Parson's hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the nick of time. Another couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">days and that hypodermic needle would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have finished him. He gave an angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunt. Who'd ever think that spineless</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellowbelly would have the guts to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill him. Well, that was another little</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter he would take pleasure in settling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yeah, the girl had been right on every</seg><seg type="columnLine">count except one. She had promised him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they could sew Ki-Gor up quick. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of that white ape's reputation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what trouble he could cause. It beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything how the jungle man had gotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean away, but the blacks said there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt but what he was badly hurt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sepah already had put the best Tatoga</seg><seg type="columnLine">trackers on his spoor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was that crockhead Nanooko's fault,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway. If the old fool had killed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately as Sepah and Gita had ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised, everything would have been all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. It would be best to get the fumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man out of the way at the earliest</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reception he was getting eased</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the tension in his belly. Sepah</seg><seg type="columnLine">had barely gotten the wizard's assistants</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cavern in time to remove the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">image and make him up for his role as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a god. He had wanted to recover a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more strength before making his advent</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Momba-N'gar, but necessity had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him no choice. That one close call was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to prove how dangerous Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be. If it hadn't been for Nanooko's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nap, the game would have been over</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duran's attention was brought back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the immediate scene when his litter bearers</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted the steps of a platform built that</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon before the council house. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered him so that he sat on the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the platform looking out over the pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate blacks. He wet his lips nervously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing he must address his new sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects. Then Sepah was bowing low beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, whispering the words he must say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his feeling of confidence returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke out to the Tatoga, reminding</seg><seg type="columnLine">them of their warrior past, telling them</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had returned to make them masters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Congo. He painted glowing pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the food, gold and ivory which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be theirs, of the countless slaves who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take over every family's work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With Momba-N'gar to lead you, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are invincible," he shouted. "And for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this which I shall give you, I ask only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">small thing in return: unquestioning obedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. From chieftain to child, all must</seg><seg type="columnLine">obey."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duran paused, expecting the crowd to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break into approving cries. He was greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with utter silence. His face paled. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wrong with them? He threw a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tressed look at Sepah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bid them rise, master, and speak their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts," she said softly. Her lips curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a faintly mocking smile. "In the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of a god, they dare make no sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">without permission."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did as she instructed. Immediately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deafening tumult was unloosed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks leaped and yelled, deliriously salut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Duran. If the god said they were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lords of the jungle, then, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they wholeheartedly approved. When there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no danger of failure, no chance they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have to pay for what they did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">right or wrong no longer worried them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER ordering the feasting to begin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duran had himself carried into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">council house which he had chosen for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his quarters. He quickly got rid of Nanoo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ko and the elders. It took longer with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gita, for he looked on himself as an equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">partner in the venture. Sepah had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wizard into her confidence the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">28	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she left Parson's, and his help had actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">effected the scheme.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hai, white man, you see I handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">things well," boasted Gita, speaking as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal. "From the time I slipped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trading post with one of my men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried you out of the hands of death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have successfully guided us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duran hid his anger at the man's fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar tone and nodded agreement. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wizard was a slippery fish and could still</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring about his downfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In all the days ahead, you will be my</seg><seg type="columnLine">right arm," Duran said, thinking the florid</seg><seg type="columnLine">native compliment would satisfy Gita.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wizard spat on the dirt floor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting his arms behind his back, stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Duran with his cheetah's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us begin by understanding each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, white man," he said coolly. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">you who will be my right arm. I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon a master I can easily control to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take on one I do not know. It is Gita</seg><seg type="columnLine">who will be the master between the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The legless man had lived his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">among dangerous, double-dealing crimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nals. Though the pulse-beat in his bull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like neck quickened, he maintained a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable outward calm. His glance shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly to Sepah, but he saw by her sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise that she was not a party to Gita's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool scheme.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And suppose I don't agree?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duran, quietly studying his broad, square</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will remember that only my assis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tants and I know the mysteries of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern," reminded Gita.

The fate of a man who makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">mock of Momba-N'gar isn't pleasant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From outside came the rising din of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">celebration, graphically reminding Duran</seg><seg type="columnLine">how easily swayed the savage black men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were. The natives were accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking on Gita as their go-between with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Momba-N'gar. It would take time to loosen</seg><seg type="columnLine">his grip on them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're no warrior, Gita," protested</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sepah. "The Lord Duran understands war</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looting as the white men practice it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without his leadership, our plans are</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gita stiffened under this prick to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boundless self-esteem.

"So long as I get my share of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loot, I don't care who gives the orders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The main thing is that we must stick</seg><seg type="columnLine">together."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gita studied Duran doubtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To prove I mean what I say," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legless man went on, "just tell me what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would iike done first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sepah looked from one to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the men. She was puzzled by Duran's</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift capitulation. She knew something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of G'ita's habits, and the thought of having</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shift her allegiance to him wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant, but if he was to be master, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she must be certain of his favor. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly devil of a white man wouldn't be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm later on when he discovered he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given her away along with his power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, uh," began Gita slowly, still feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out Duran, "I want first to get Nanoo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ko out of the way. He's a sly old jackal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the people love him, which makes him</seg><seg type="columnLine">too dangerous to have around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're absolutely right," Duran swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed'. He knew how to handle this sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. "Now I know you don't want to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">blamed for his death, so I'll take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsibility. Tomorrow I'll begin to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain of feeling an enemy near me. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few days I'll order you to smell out</seg><seg type="columnLine">•this man working against me. Naturally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll pick out Nanooko. I'll dispose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him myself with my throwing stick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gita beamed. The white man had knuck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">led under more easily than he had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected. He had hated Nanooko all the years</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had served him and he had an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grained fear of the old man. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftain dead, he would have no one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppose his influence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anything else you want ?" asked Duran</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly. He could tell the wizard had an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other matter in his mind which he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitant about revealing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Gita admitted, "there is." Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he launched into a long talk on the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance of his gaining face with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other tribes, of doing something striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would impress upon them that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a man to be reckoned with. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE OF THE JACKAL PRIESTESS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">kept sliding past Duran's. Finally, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could delay the issue no longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to take the White Lord's mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">as my wife," he blurted. 'We will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great ceremony, and Momba-N'gar him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self will perform the marriage rites.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hai!!" he cried excitedly, "Every tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the jungle will wag when it's known</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have taken Ki-Gor's woman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duran pulled at his lower lip, his yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes drawing to thoughtful slits. Accord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to native beliefs, the ultimate humilia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion a conqueror could visit on an humbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftain was to take over his wives. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor's case, the matter would have even</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater meaning, for the jungle man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce devotion to his red-haired mate was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known throughout the Congo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sepah caught her breath. She wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">no rivals, especially not that .golden-skin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ned, blue-eyed woman. With that body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hers, Helene would have both Gita and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duran around her little finger if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished. Sepah judged all women by her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own standards, and she knew from ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience what a compliant slave girl could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do to influence a master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You forget the White Lord still lives,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she objected hastily. "Remember what has</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to others who desired the red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired woman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Gita's quick rise in the world filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with bravado. His lips twisted scorn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So much the better that he lives," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled. "It will show my contempt for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he glanced narrowly at Duran,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious that his silence meant opposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He half-expected that the white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">would oppose his taking a woman of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">race. But Duran surprised him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a clever man," rumbled Duran.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a wonderful idea and we'll make</seg><seg type="columnLine">something big out of it." He hesitated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But how do we get our hands on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gita blinked in surprise. "Why, she's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prisoner now! We caught her with Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ohhh!" Duran murmured, cutting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes at Sepah. The cunning wench had</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected to tell him about Helene. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled inwardly. He'd show both these</seg><seg type="columnLine">sly blacks a trick or so before he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me see," he mused. "We must do</seg><seg type="columnLine">this right. Let's send messengers to every</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighboring tribe informing them Momba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'gar has returned to life and that five</seg><seg type="columnLine">days hence the god will wed his favorite</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, Gita, to Helene. We'll invite all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftains to attend. After the ceremony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll grab the whole bunch and hold them</seg><seg type="columnLine">as hostages."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANGRY concern was written in Se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pah's expression. She saw herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">being completely thrown aside. The legless</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had let himself be shorn of power</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a struggle and now Gita was plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to take a woman of another race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes!" Gita hissed delightedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's it--a big ceremony." Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned. "We mustn't hold the chieftains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though. We would be shamed in the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of others. A guest can't be harmed unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wrongs his host."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duran made a deprecatory gesture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look, wouldn't you like to have twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribes calling you king? Well, you can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if you move fast and forget about</seg><seg type="columnLine">rules. What do you care about customs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long as you win. Let the other fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">play fair and we'll play to win."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went on to explain that with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftains in their hands, the leaderless</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribes wouldn't dare attack them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll pick the tribes off one by one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping them from organizing by tying</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up with long-winded conferences,</seg><seg type="columnLine">promises that we're about to release their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftains, threats about what will happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they make a hostile move."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The small-minded wizard hadn't en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visoned conquest on such magnitude. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a king of kings. His qualms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor quickly succumbed to greed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the gods, you're right!" he cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandly, "what have rules to do with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as Gita."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes were glittering black beads. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams alone, the wizard was drunk al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I go to arrange for messengers, to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pare the drummers to sound the news of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my marriage to the jungle." His tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicked over his lips. "Yes, and I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">amuse myself by visiting the girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duran threw up his hands in immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate disapproval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remember, we must act carefully until</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nanooko is gone," he cautioned. "Show no</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in the girl.

Nanooko would be furi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous if the wizard of his own accord mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lested Helene, but if Momba-N'gar</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested the marriage, the old man would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to give his approval. Gita left, mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering because for a few more days he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must bend to the chieftain's desires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A smile gathered on the legless man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly features as he watched the wizard go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He scratched down his hairy chest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his paunchy stomach. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">well pleased with himself as he turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance on Sepah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You gonna stand around posing all</seg><seg type="columnLine">night," he growled. "C'mere you little filly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why do you think I've been trying to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">rid of all these apes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room was illuminated with torches</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck in the dirt floor. Sepah's skin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">burnished copper in the yellow light. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">only covering was a small leather apron</seg><seg type="columnLine">held by a thong twisted low about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hips. Her jutting breasts rose and fell with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hard, fast sweep of her breathing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the emotion revealed in her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rage. She was so angry that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily speechless. This white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cheated her of everything she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked for and now he thought she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to him, wriggling with happiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You filthy dango," she burst out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling on your, belly before that weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling, Gita. So he is to be a great king, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are to be his servant? So he is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry that red-haired wench?" Her teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath her curved lips were a cat's white</seg><seg type="columnLine">fangs. "And Sepah is forgotten!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She whirled with feline litheness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang toward the nearest torch. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched the length of wood from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and raised it like a club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll pay you back for this," she cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She leaped in at him, meaning to crush</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bullet head with the flaming torch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sepah didn't realize Duran deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">had goaded her, curious to know how she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would react. Despite his apparent absorp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in Gita, he had been slyly watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, guessing the thoughts in her mind all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the while he talked with the wizard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duran was slightly surprised at the vio-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lence of outburst, but he wasn't caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprepared. As the nearly-naked girl flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him, he waited, his head hunched deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his beefy shoulders, his huge arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread wide to the floor. He didn't move</seg><seg type="columnLine">a muscle until she was almost on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he spun himself like a great crab,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pivoting his trunk by a swift, scuttling</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion of his hands. He moved with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing agility, whipping out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's way, then whirling back to grasp her</seg><seg type="columnLine">slim ankle in his thick fingers. As many</seg><seg type="columnLine">others had discovered too late, Sepah</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned Duran was not so helpless as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tried to turn and aim a second blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him, but he jerked her legs from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. The girl hit flat on her stomach, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch rolling out of her fingers. Duran</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched her lie stunned, struggling for</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. He gave an ugly chuckle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled her through the dirt toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran his hand up the glossy firmness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her leg. She tried to struggle, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough fingers closed about her waist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pulled her into his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you'd kill old Duran, eh?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">taunted. Sepah was rigid with fear, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing what the brutish white man would</seg><seg type="columnLine">do to her. "Well, my pretty cat, you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn I'm not as stupid as you think. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">all day I've been thinking of being alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you and in the very first minute you</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to bash in my head."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But your, promises to me," she whim</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered, her eyes wide with fright, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't keep them.

At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first he was unconscious of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him, his mind turned inward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was cut off from everything!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But gradually the sounds and smells of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle crept in on him, and each one</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought a picture of another small, accus-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed thing which He: would never see</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smelled the subtly-sweet fragrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the grass on which he lay, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damp, warm odor of the brown earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing in behind it. He heard the dart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, irregular rustle of a lizard stalking</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects not a hand's reach away. Never be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore had the bird calls been so clear, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquidly perfect, each carving a quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged image on his tightly-closed lids.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In endless procession the catalogue of or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary, but suddenly precious, jungle life</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued in his mind's eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vaguely, he became aware that in the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance a signal drum had begun to talk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was only another sound among many,</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching him, evoking a picture, but stir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring no thought processes. He held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum-throb for an instant and then thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">it away to go on to the chattering exchange</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two grey-ruffed monkeys and the ill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempered, explosive grunts of a wild hog</seg><seg type="columnLine">marching his family through the brush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drifted in a half-dream, consciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">resisting real thought.

Like an electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock one of these disconnected words</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasted him out of his lethargy. He swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside all other noises, reached with strain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ears for the drum-talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face twisted with hate as he lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened.

Gita had beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cowardly White Lord, had run him</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling into the forest, the drummer</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and the marriage was a sign to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Ki-Gor's power was forever broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his wrath, Ki-Gor forget himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were wide-open, staring at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lanes of trees, the thick-banked, teeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenery of the undergrowth. He started</seg><seg type="columnLine">running toward the drum, his one thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">being to find Gita and kill him with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare hands. And he wasn't blundering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling now. He sped with his old sureness</seg><seg type="columnLine">down tiny game trails, searching out pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages through the jungle where another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man would have been helplessly blocked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't realize he was seeing again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing with normal clarity, until suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light about him flickered and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey. Mist seemed to leap up out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle floor, wavering clouds of it, smoth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering out the sun. Then the grey deepened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ki-Gor reeled to a stop, slamming</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a tree just as utter darkness swal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave a sick, agonized cry against</seg><seg type="columnLine">this thing he could not fight.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his mind steadied, he saw that for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time his eyes had been all right. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindness had been gone when he leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up under the lash of the drum message.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why could he see one minute and the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">be totally blind?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He forced himself to be calm while step</seg><seg type="columnLine">by step he went back to the time he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened that morning. The first hint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble was when he climbed out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravine. He grew panicky and tried to push</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way through the jungle. Then was</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he went totally blind. After that, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested quietly until he heard the drum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaping up he found he could see as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as ever, yet after running a few hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred yards he was once more plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The answer sprang out at him: so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his mind and body were at rest, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes functioned all right, but physical ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ertion combined with mental turmoil some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how blacked out his vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And before another hour passed, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor proved this surmise true. After he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested, his eyes cleared. He found that by</seg><seg type="columnLine">going at a cautious walk, only the faintest</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist danced before him. A trot thickened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mist and the exertion of running</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly brought full blindness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beside a stream, he found the herbs he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted and made a poultice for his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he set out for the Tatoga kraal. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey, which tree-travel would have al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him to make in a half day, took him</seg><seg type="columnLine">until noon of the next day. Tatoga war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors prowled ever path near the kraal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping a look-out for Ki-Gor. It required</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his rich jungle lore to worm his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">past these blacks. But at last the job was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done and he climbed into the cover of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree near the village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could hear a babble of excited na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive voices, the plunging beat of hooves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the legless man's roaring laugh. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed higher in the branches until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see into the central clearing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight that greeted him broke the iron con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol which he had maintained for hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent the angry blood plunging through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">veins with such violence that the blindness</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NDER the cool shade of a thatch</seg><seg type="columnLine">pavilion sat the legless man drinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">native beer with Tom Parson. By their</seg><seg type="columnLine">look and by the number of gourds scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered around them, they had been busy for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time with the bitter, potent brew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sepah tended their wants, purring about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the legless man like a well-fed cat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Duran wasted no attention on Se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pah. His eyes were riveted delightedly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clearing, where he was staging some</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutal show for his twisted pleasure. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side, N'Geeso and his pygmies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">held at spear point by Nanooko's giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, whom" Duran had taken over for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own, while across the clearing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards held seven zebra. Duran was forc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the pygmies to ride bare-backed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without even a halter to aid them, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">screeching with glee as the wild ponies</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw the small men and tried to tram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Tatoga fancied the taste of zebra</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat and often journeyed to the veldt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap them alive. In a tour of the kraal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that morning, Duran spotted the ponies in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pen. It occurred to him that if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could break one of the stubborn little ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals, he would be able to get about for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself instead of having to be carried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the litter. From that idea to making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pygmies risk their lives on the ponies had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been an easy, natural step for Duran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of the pygmies except N'Geeso had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been forced to ride when Ki-Gor climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE OF THE JACKAL PRIESTESS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into his vantage point. Duran had saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pygmy chieftain for the last, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken a sadistic pleasure in taunting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man every time one of his warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thrown. Though N'Geeso was seething</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside, he never deigned to show the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion at Duran's insults.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Let's see the little rooster keep his dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity on that largest pony," cried the leg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Six guards, hanging on desperately, led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wildest of the zebras to the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clearing.

Duran blinked dully, caught off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard by this unexpected show of resis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance from a man completely at his mercy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He noted how the crowd froze, realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they watched to see how he acquitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He could have the pygmy slain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but then he felt the little man would die</seg><seg type="columnLine">the victor, for he openly invited death</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than submit to Duran's order. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">save his face, he must bring N'Geeso to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you lost your voice?" sneered</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso. "Go on and order these cowardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">women you call warriors to use their</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears.

He snorted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt. "Aaaiieee!! They will need to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn how a man should die, because for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this day's work, Ki-Gor's blade will take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible toll of this soft-bellied pack."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Duran's face purpled, the veins of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous neck swelling with rage. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye fell on Gita, and seeing the wizard, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a sudden inspiration. He'd show the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatoga how Duran could bring this bark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing terrier to heel,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3--Jungle Stories--Spring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bring out the red-haired woman," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered, concealing his true feelings with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a silken tone.

Ha! He'd caught the pygmy in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft place. The little chieftain would eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt now, because he could never bear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Helene mistreated. Though at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duran had meant only to bluff N'Geeso</seg><seg type="columnLine">into riding, he was so pleased at seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his victim squirm, that he decided to actu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally make the girl ride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gita, who had been enjoying the sadis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic proceedings immensely, abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed his tack when he saw his soon-to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be property endangered.

His abnormally</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen senses of smell and hearing helped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make his vigils more than an empty pose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially at night, when sight was of little</seg><seg type="columnLine">value, and he maneuvered it so that most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night duty fell to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor grew adept at fooling even</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso as to his true condition, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">Constantly assured the pygmy leader that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sight was returning, when actually he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely learning to make his way about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the post without stumbling into obstacles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the Tatoga drums began to send the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face-saving tale that Momba-N'gar had</seg><seg type="columnLine">postponed the marriage of Gita and Hel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ene to a more propitious time fourteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">days hence, Ki-Gor couldn't derive even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bitterest satisfaction from the message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The legless man's embarrassment be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause neighboring chieftains were due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin arriving for the ceremony meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the search for Helene would be inten-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sified. Never had Ki-Gor hated anyone as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did Duran. His desire to kill the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a wild bodily hunger, a hunger</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gnawed more savagely as Helene grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaker and more feverish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the third night, soon after Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had climbed to the small watchtower on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stockade about the post, he caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent of Tatoga warriors. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaking their identity for along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their body smell the breeze carried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pungent odor of the particular oil with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they smeared their bodies. Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't guess their number accurately, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew there were not more than five</seg><seg type="columnLine">or six.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slid out of the watchtower, dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground and hurried into the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rouse N'Geeso. "They may go past, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is well to be ready," he said calmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'Geeso sucked at his underlip thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. "These few won't have to stomach</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attack even if they find we're in here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they'll go yapping back for the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pack."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us see that they don't get back,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Lord declared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how?" asked the pygmy. "At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first spear we loose, they'll flee like fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened dik-dik deer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They won't have a chance," Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly pointed out. "We'll leave the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">ajar as though the place were deserted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They won't pass up the chance to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night indoors and once they're all in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, we'll close the gate. Three of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">pygmies are still able to make a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">passes with a knife despite their wounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It won't take any real fighting, since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage of surprise will be on our side."</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso's black eyes glittered approv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly at the plan. He roused the three men</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor had indicated, started them hob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling toward the gate. Ki-Gor took one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parson's covered cooking pots, and squint-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his eyes to see, opened the small iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">stove and scooped out coals from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banked fire. He took the trader's thatch</seg><seg type="columnLine">broom, soaked it with kerosene which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trader used in his prized lantern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the jungle man went swiftly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate, gave the broom and covered pot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coals to one of the pygmies along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered instructions. The men fell back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the darkness along the wall as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the gate. Satisfied that all was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE OF THE JACKAL PRIESTESS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he wished, Ki-Gor climbed cautiously into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watchtower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Tatoga were much nearer now. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could follow their progress by the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">break in a night bird's song, by the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap of a twig, or the abrupt silence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened tree toads. These differences</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hum of jungle life would have gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnoticed by the average man, but Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor knew their meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND THEN for the first time beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the harsh scent of the Tatoga he dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguished a smell which made his face go</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard and cold. A white man traveled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the natives! It could be either the legless</seg><seg type="columnLine">man or Parson. It didn't matter which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, because both in their own way had</seg><seg type="columnLine">betrayed him, and he remembered how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of them had sat together drinking beer</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the pygmies and Helene were tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parson's participation he didn't under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, but it was clear that he had worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand in glove with the legless man to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit Ki-Gor. The drunken act before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief Nanooko had been nothing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than an act.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Otherwise, why would Parson be sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a friend with Duran while the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners were misused?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor whispered the new information</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the pygmies and then crouched down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tower. As he expected, the Tatoga</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted where the brush was cleared back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the trading post and sent one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling forward to reconnoiter. The black</seg><seg type="columnLine">was careful, coming with a snake's silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling away from the watchtower and</seg><seg type="columnLine">working his way flat along the wall to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though for a time the native hesitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring into the blackness of the post, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open gate quieted any suspicions he held.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He came ten steps inside the stockade and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to listen. The pygmies were within</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy reach of him, but to all appearances</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had melted into the ground. The black</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a satisfied grunt, and turning back</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, called in normal tones to his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions that the place was deserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came forward in a relieved group,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grumbling together of their weariness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger. One man kept stumbling as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could hardly force his feet to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">those last few yards. Ki-Gor stayed down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> so they wouldn't see his white skin, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept tabs on them with his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they were all within the stockade</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gathered almost below him, he raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently, gripped the balustrade around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watchtower with one hand, while with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other he held a knife taken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parson's trade stock. It was time for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pygmies to go into action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sudden crash, the gate slammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. In the same instant, the kerosene</seg><seg type="columnLine">soaked broom burst into flame. With light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning precision, the pygmies sprang the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap. They bounded out of the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">with drawn blades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But swift as the pygmies were, Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was swifter. With a snarl of pure animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage, he leaped from the tower, landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on widespread legs before the white man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His hand shot up for a knife stroke that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would decapitate his enemy. He realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Parson, not the legless man, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You slimy snake," he growled, sway-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in for the kill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!!" shrieked Parson. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong, Ki-Gor! Listen to us. We're</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parson was no worse terrified than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. There was no fight in them. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams for mercy four of the blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw themselves on their knees. Parson</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered back in an effort to get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the jungle man and sprawled flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his back. Not a single Tatoga warrior</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to raise a weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was one of the blacks who</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his feet. Even in that moment when</seg><seg type="columnLine">death rushed in upon him he kept his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity. That one was the aged Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nanooko himself. He raised his right palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Tatoga gesture of peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be more just than I was, O, Ki-Gor,".</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said in his old man's voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor had purposely leaped as close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the group as possible so that in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, flaring light of the reeds his dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes would be able to distinguish his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies. He recognized Nanooko's tones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out indistinctly the thin, frail body</seg><seg type="columnLine">which alone did not shrink from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the light blur against the chieftain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">black body was unmistakably his palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised in peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nanooko's calm dignity sheered through'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Lord's armor of hate. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not in Ki-Gor to kill an old, defenseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">man or warriors who groveled like sheep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold, my pygmies!" he shouted. "Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dangos live!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke in the bare nick of time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with less disciplined men than N'Geeso's</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked warriors it would have still been</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late. The pygmies crashed into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended victims, straining to divert blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">already launched. And in truth, they drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood on two of the Tatoga, able to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatal injuries, but not flesh wounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the small men leaped back, ring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the Tatoga, their faces fierce with</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointment. An enemy was an enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, and the sooner he was slain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your guards are not so brave when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they face a few blades instead of a help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less girl," spat Ki-Gor bitterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nanooko's voice broke in sorrow as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered.

"What lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">is this?" he asked.

He begged me to save him, promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go straight if I did."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His fingers tightened around the bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with sudden haste he swigged down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge drink. When he finished gasping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he resumed in a harder tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I figured he'd gotten his lesson. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, his legs were beyond saving and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought a legless man was a poor bet</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a life of violence. I fixed him up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hid him, nursed him back to life--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he repaid me by stealing my prescription</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanks, forging my name to them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a big haul of narcotics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">iiTTE used the money he got to leave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O	the country. Naturally, it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before the police were on me about</seg><seg type="columnLine">all those forged blanks. It came out that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had concealed him from the law. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time the publicity died down, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished as a doctor. The general idea was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had worked in partnership with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. After all, he was my brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I lost my license to practice. Medicine</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been my one love, my only interest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went to pieces fast and the bottle got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be my only friend. One day I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of a drunken haze to find myself on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board a vessel with Duran grinning at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. He was running guns and smuggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">drugs and he needed someone to patch</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his men. It amused him to have me</seg><seg type="columnLine">around as a whipping boy. Whenever I</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to fight back, he'd nearly kill me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took a perverse pleasure in having</seg><seg type="columnLine">me around him. But one night a gunboat</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew us out of the water off the Congo</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast. I managed to get ashore and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an effort to hide, I worked my way inland</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eventually landed here. I had to live,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so drifted into trading."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parson fell silent, his head bowed, turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the bottle slowly in his fingers. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked small and shrunken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a very pretty story, is it?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said when Ki-Gor failed to comment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But maybe now you'll understand why</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said what I did before Nanooko and</seg><seg type="columnLine">why it pleased Duran to make me drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">beer with him. He forgot about me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the confusion, though, and when the kraal</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptied of warriors, Nanooko's four kins-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and I were able to free the chief."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor stood over the trader, the harsh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness gone from his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fix up the pygmies, Parson," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, "and then maybe you'll be good</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to look at Helene.

Parson asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a voice so soft it reached Ki-Gor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears alone. His trained eyes hadn't missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle man's condition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Caught off-guard, Ki-Gor was at a loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">for words for several seconds.

The discredited doctor seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach back into the past and recover for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brief period all the skill which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once been his. He poured everything in</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into the effort to make her well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortunately, N'Geeso's haphazard appli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation of the drug was as excellent an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate treatment as any physician</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have given her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was shock, more than serious injury,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had brought her so close to death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With much the same effect as adrenalin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poison had kept her heart going. Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son dosed her with an antidote which</seg><seg type="columnLine">nullified the poisonous elements which had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been undoing the good work of the drug.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within a week, Helene was sitting up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her strenuous, outdoor life with Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had kept her in splendid physical con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition. The lithe, strong jungle girl swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly recovered her vigor. And she kept im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proving, despite the fact that increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger of discovery made it necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the small band to leave the post and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide in the jungle, shifting position every</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Parson didn't meet with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">success with Ki-Gor. Daily the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered deeper about the jungle man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brief periods in which he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew fewer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't mislead you," Parson said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That blow you took on the head appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently jarred the delicate optic nerves. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps with rest your eyes will adjust them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves of their own accord. Then again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it may require a surgeon far more skilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I am to correct the trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped uneasily, his manner in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicating there was more he wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say. Ki-Gor finished for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it's possible, I may never see at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all," the White Lord declared. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">really what you're trying to tell me, isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now don't jump to conclusions," Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son soothed unconvincingly, guessing how</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed Ki-Gor was behind his mask</seg><seg type="columnLine">of calmness. "I actually don't know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious it is. This is out of my field, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I just have to feel my way along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to Helene, the two chieftains and</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs warriors, Parson was franker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got to keep Ki-Gor quiet," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned. "It's my belief that his extreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">exertions after his head injury greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmed him. If he gets in another brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Tatoga or tries to make the fast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard trek necessary to get us out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatoga area, it may make him permanent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly blind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'Geeso listened soberly. His own war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors weren't in proper condition to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tatoga gauntlet, but the small chieftain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been scouting their immediate locality</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew that Duran suddenly was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring more and more men into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle around them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It means certain death if we don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave now," protested one of Nanooko's</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who had scouted with N'Geeso. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE OF THE JACKAL PRIESTESS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">can't evade that devil's trackers forever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say we should make a run for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We stay with Ki-Gor!"

"Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more be said about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well spoken," commended N'Geeso.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have a lion's heart, old one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warrior subsided under Nanooko's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern glance, lowered his eyes sullenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though he didn't dare argue further, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was obvious the chieftain's words didn't sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">well with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As good steel will rust if constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed to dampness," mused N'Geeso</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself, "so at times will a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage crumble, if exposed for too long</seg><seg type="columnLine">a period to danger. I must keep an eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that warrior."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But too many other matters demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso's attention for him to constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch one man. Because of Nanooko's</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, it was up to the pygmy to direct the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party, keep it hidden and try to secure</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough food. Twice Tatoga patrols al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most stumbled on them and it was clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the searchers' manner that they knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">their quarry was close.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steadily, the tension gripping the fugi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives grew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pygmies had replaced their lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowguns and brewed a new supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison, and Parson had brought along</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle from the trading post, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't hope to offer more than a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">show of resistance against the swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatoga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the second afternoon after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conference that N'Geeso discovered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nanooko's kinsman disappeared. A glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their meager stores of food and water</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that the man had taken all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could carry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shocked Nanooko stormed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a rage, feeling it was a personal dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grace that a man of his blood should</seg><seg type="columnLine">play the coward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parson was not so harsh in his judg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment as the two chieftains. "Fear rots</seg><seg type="columnLine">many a man," he said, looking at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. "Anyway, one person more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less won't make any difference in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances if we're attacked. And the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took supplies shows he isn't going over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the enemy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'Geeso looked across to the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Ki-Gor lay with his eyes bandaged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">No explanation Parson could make would</seg><seg type="columnLine">soften his opinion of the deserter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's not as easily dismissed as that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso said grimly.

A snake couldn't wriggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the Tatoga, let alone that blundering</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool. Two days ago he might have made it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not now. And once he's captured, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legless man will learn our position."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nanooko nodded unhappy agreement</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suggested that they move immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're probably too late already,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged N'Geeso, "but it's the only thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have left to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before N'Geeso could finish giving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men their orders, Helene came up, say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the White Lord wished to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's wrong?" Ki-Gor abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though N'Geeso had tried to shield</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor from as much worry as possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this instance he didn't try to hide the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriousness of their situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of Nanooko's men has deserted,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he explained. "I thought it wise for us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move in case he is captured."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it isn't that," Ki-Gor said. "Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing's wrong in the jungle. Listen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that troop of baboons going full speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the trees. And off to the right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear those bush buck crashing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the undergrowth?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ABSORBED in getting the party ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to travel, N'Geeso hadn't paid any</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the growing animal noises</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the camp. But now that he lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened, he noted that a kind of panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be spreading among the jungle's</seg><seg type="columnLine">denizens. Flocks of birds passed above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and in the distance came the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated roars of disturbed jungle rats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No number of men milling about could</seg><seg type="columnLine">so disturb the forest," he said, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">baffled air, "it's very strange."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor stood up,, first listening, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffing the sluggish, humid air. He made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no effort to remove the thick bandage from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes. He accepted the fact that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso could see nothing wrong, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own dim vision certainly would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">of no value in finding a solution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the wrong time of year for</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the dingo packs," he said, referring to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vicious wild dogs which ran amok</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the dry season. "And the noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">is too widespread to be caused by driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants." A muscle worked in his cheek and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice suddenly quickened. "It can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">but one thing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh?" grunted N'Geeso, still puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The forest is aflame!" Ki-Gor said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's what's driving the animals in</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us from so many directions. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire still is far off, but we must be ringed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in by it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Consternation gripped N'Geeso. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a terror he hadn't expected, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a moment before he could rally his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. "How could that be?" he asked.-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The legless man is taking no further</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances on our eluding him," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord. "He's learned our approxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate location from the deserter and means</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drive us from hiding. It's an old trick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll find one avenue left open through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring of fire. That's where he'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting to scoop us in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And within two hours, Ki-Gor's pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diction proved true. N'Geeso scouted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">area with four men and found solid walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flame advancing in upon them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">every side. Only a narrow corridor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south wasn't burning. This one avenue</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rocky, treeless canyon, broad enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave a safe path even though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle on either side of it was an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferno. Not. one of Duran's warriors re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained within the fire-encircled area,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was added proof that the trap was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his carefully prepared handiwork.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By morning the flames were so close</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the small band was forced to retreat</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the canyon. Over and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso tried to find some break in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those burning walls, but each time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned red-eyed and coughing to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself down in a weary, discouraged</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap. When he caught his breath, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would move the party nearer the corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Duran waited and then set out once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again on his hopeless tour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But finally even the indomitable little</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftain had to give up hope. Always</seg><seg type="columnLine">before in tight places he had been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look to the White Lord for leadership.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time the full burden had fallen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and he felt his failure to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party to safety was a mark of personal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">inadequacy. He felt he had betrayed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With drooping shoulders, he stood apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his companions, watching the rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtain of smoke advance toward them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing behind the murky clouds the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst of flame where trees and bushes</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught fire in intense heat. Helene guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso's feelings and left her mate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go and stand beside the little man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he became aware of her presence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he raised his tired, lined face.

She closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes, clenched her small fists tightly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were flecks of fear in her blue eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she opened them and her lips trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps there is yet a way," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">huskily.

"Something's wrong with Helene!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parson argued no further. After all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had little time left to live, so what</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it matter. He flipped the safety catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his rifle and leaped ahead of Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. This would be a better way for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to go than to sit and wait for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Parson and Ki-Gor in the lead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the handful of warriors ran after Helene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was easy going at first, but after</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two hundred yards they came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a dense, swirling cloud of smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A--Jungle Stories---Spring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The fire had advanced to that point along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper rims of the canyon, and though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocky canyon was free of burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush, the thick smoke poured down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hollow place, bridged it with a moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">black wall which kept pace with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stumbling and choking, they managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get through the pall.

His long efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find a way out of the trap that day</seg><seg type="columnLine">had exposed him to the flame and smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much that his lungs and eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">terribly irritated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In trying to follow Helene, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">run against a rock and had fallen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke cloud.

"What more</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you want?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She started forward, matching her pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that of the retreating warriors so she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would keep exactly the same safe distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them until they were out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene had advanced two-thirds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the position just vacated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duran's warriors when Ki-Gor and Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son rounded a turn in the canyon behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and came in sight. They had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exchange between the girl and Duran,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now Parson told Ki-Gor that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the Tatoga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come back here, Helene!" shouted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord.

It was-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">because of her unselfish love for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight, tall jungle man that she did this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. She had gambled that he wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn her intent until it was too late for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to interfere. Now fear of what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do deep-carved her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leave me alone," she sobbed. "I'm do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing what's right.

From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposedly deserted Tatoga entrenchment</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped the wizard, Gita, and two of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistants. Duran had left them there to</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture the trusting girl. His apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrawal was for the sole purpose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing her within the witch-doctor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three blacks, fearful that Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would keep them from trapping Helene,</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted from concealment and sped up be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the girl. In the confusion, Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to hear the quick spatter of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare feet. But Parson saw his brother's</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected treachery and snarled the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Ki-Gor. ■</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can we reach her before they do?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Ki-Gor, unable to see his mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can't," declared Parson, "but bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that, he slid to a stop, raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle and fired. The first shot whined</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmlessly up the canyon. Duran began</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming to his warriors to turn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge. Then the legless man whirled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">zebra, and followed by his fotir mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, came racing back toward Helene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PARSON was steadier on his second</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot, and sent one of the witchdoctors</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his knees with his face blasted away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was enough for the cowardly Gita.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He spun around, deserting his assistant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fled. Parson wasted valuable mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments trying to draw a certain bead on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief wizard. But in his nervousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">he missed the moving target Before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE OF THE JACKAL PRIESTESS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could throw another cartridge in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber, Ki-Gor's powerful body sprinted</seg><seg type="columnLine">between him and Gita.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord had kept running</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the trader stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gita's assistant reached the red-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, unaware that his chief had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail. Helene fought him with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength in her slim body, scratching and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicking to keep him from lifting her</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The assistant struck at Helene, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to knock her senseless so he could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">her away before the White Lord reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. But Helene was like an eel in his?</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp. She twisted around, locked a leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind his, and sent them both tumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground. She kept crying out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor, knowing he could find her only</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the sound of her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly realizing that Gita had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him alone to face Ki-Gor, the black's</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage evaporated. He beat Helene away</seg><seg type="columnLine">in panic and scrambled to his knees, mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to run for it. The White Lord was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging in upon them, bent forward as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ran, his eyes wide and staring as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Into Ki-Gor's fading range of vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the sight of the black man hitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene. A deep animal growl of rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from his throat and his great hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached to scoop the black from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Oblivious of the charging Tatoga,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the enraged Duran spurring ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his forces, Ki-Gor caught the man by</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat and crotch and jerked him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then just as he would break a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of kindling, the White Lord brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrilly screaming black crashing down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his leg. With one blow, he splintered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">witchdoctor's spine. Then he straightened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised the jerking body high overhead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled it to the ground with bone-crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parson reached Ki-Gor, firing as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran. "I'll get him! I'll get that murdering</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil!" he kept muttering hysterically. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trader's hands were jerking and trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling, and he shot wilder with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In utter scorn of the trader's gun, Duran</seg><seg type="columnLine">came on at a gallop. One of the odd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped throwing sticks was in his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. Helene caught at Ki-Gor's arm,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crying to him in the rising din to try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape back down the canyon. Her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistened with tears as she realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually there was no hope of his getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. In trying to save him, she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only succeeded in hastening his death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's my fault, Ki-Gor," she mourned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I wanted to save you. I love you so."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her voice broke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor felt for her blindly. His exer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions had once more plunged him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness. He caught her against him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth found hers. Then he shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">her away behind him, and turned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of the Tatoga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's pitiful handful of followers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had faltered at the sight of the thronging</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatoga. N'Geeso frenziedly cursed them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to force them to close ranks around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene. But it made no difference that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they never reached her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duran gave a savage yell and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his curved stick with deadly accuracy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The heavy piece of wood smashed against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parson's throat, spun the mortally injured</seg><seg type="columnLine">trader over in a jerking heap. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing stick was hardly launched, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore Duran caught another in his hairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist and sent it hurtling at the blind White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Helene screamed, knowing Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">without his sight had no chance to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">the missile. Ki-Gor whirled at the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her voice, thinking a Tatoga had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached his mate. He didn't move in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wholly escape the blow, but he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn just enough so that the stick hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancingly, tearing open the old wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his forehead. Had the curved wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck as Duran intended, it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheared off the upper part of his skull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor staggered, his hands starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach toward his face. Then his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped leadenly and he fell in his tracks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wash of scarlet, covering his features.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene's torfured scream mingled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duran's roar of triumph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He clung atop his mount like a gro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tesque monster, his lips sheered back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal viciousness, as he thundered down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the helpless girl. He leaned in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'saddle and reaching with one huge arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept Helene from her feet at a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallop. Then he turned the zebra expertly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting away to avoid N'Geeso's men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His four mounted guards drove straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on, crashing at full tilt into the pygmies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nanooko's men. Before the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">group could recover, the Tatoga footmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on them. In one swift, swirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute it was over. The flood of warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed over the tiny band and when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finished, only N'Geeso and Nanooko</seg><seg type="columnLine">still lived. They emerged with their lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely because Duran had ordered them</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved for a more spectacular execution</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the time of the wedding ceremony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE legless man refused to let Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to Ki-Gor. He had guards hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Then he rode over to where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of his step brother lay. His brutal</seg><seg type="columnLine">face didn't change expression as he stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the frail, broken figure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man he actually had destroyed long be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore this day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned the zebra so he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor.

"I want to take good care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. After all, pretty soon we'll be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only two whites left among these savages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so we better start sticking together." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">guffawed at his sadistic joke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene had borne all she could stand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maddened with grief, she staggered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a kick the black who held her zebra's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reins. She dug her heels into the pony's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides. The half-wild animal gave two leaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crashed against Duran's mount.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Struck broadside, the legless man's pony</seg><seg type="columnLine">was knocked from its feet and fell hard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duran was catapulted from the saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went rolling and bouncing across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground like a great barrel. It happened so</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly and unexpectedly that not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his men had a chance to interfere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she first acted, Helene's sole object</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to hurt or maim Duran. The legless</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had been holding the reins to Ki-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's zebra, but he turned these loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his pony went down. The animal on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Ki-Gor was tied whirled in fright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattering the men who stood around it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene instantly saw an opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheat Duran of his triumph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her animal, shaken by the collision,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled back on its haunches. Helene kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it into motion, started up the canyon to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the fire. She swept past Ki-Gor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount, and as she knew it would, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stampeded after her. With a ringing clatter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hooves, the two striped beasts tore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through the loose crowd and broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop them!" came Duran's infuriated</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar. "Shoot down those zebra, you gaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">fools!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arrows were flung into a score of bows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but before a single bowman could fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brawny black took two great running</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaps and cast his spear. The black shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut a thin, quick arc through the air and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slashed into the right hind leg of Helene's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hamstrung zebra toppled as its leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave way.

The other zebra</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove past within two feet of her, going</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a full gallop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air was suddenly full of whirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows as the Tatoga sought to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the second animal before it got out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of range. An arrow dug into the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture's haunches, serving only to whip it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater speed. Three more barbs struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost together. One digging into its side</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches from Ki-Gor's head. The zebra</seg><seg type="columnLine">faltered for a second, then recovered its</seg><seg type="columnLine">stride, and disappeared around the bend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After him," commanded Duran. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded zebra can't carry him long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene sank down on her face in thei</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. She was too exhausted and beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight any more. Whether the frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">zebra carried Ki-Gor into the flames or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether Duran recaptured him, the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord was forever lost to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KI-GOR swam up through darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A vague, worrisome murmuring of</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices stirred him to try to gather his</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses. Then the sharp pain in his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE OF THE JACKAL PRIESTESS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him, held him paralyzed for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time the pain eased, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly conscious. There was the taste of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood in his mouth and he could feel it</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaming over his face. He recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duran's voice, but before he could wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand what had happened, a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">commotion broke around him. He heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swift clatter of hooves, the impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two heavy bodies colliding, and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the animal under him give a surging leap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He clung desperately with arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs to the heaving zebra as it bucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice and then broke into a run. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding, heaving motion brought a wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sickness. His head seemed about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst. Then he lost consciousness again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Ki-Gor came to the second time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke seared his nostrils. The zebra had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped running. It stood wide-legged, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">head down, slowly dying from the arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds inflicted by the Tatoga. The ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal had run through the canyon and kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">going until it spent the last of its waning</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength trying to find a way through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Great, rasping breaths shook the zebra.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its muscles trembled violently. The fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs gave way first, and seconds later the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind legs collapsed. With an almost gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion, the zebra rolled over on its side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinning Ki-Gor in a near sitting position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the weight of the creature's midsec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on his lap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That crushing weight on his legs shocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor alert. He had to free his bonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon or he was finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without thinking, he pressed his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the zebra to wipe the blood from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes. Then he raised his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about him. Thick smoke lay every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where and a roaring, crackling line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire moved in toward him. The zebra had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried him back into the fire trap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was estimating how much time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had before the fire reached him, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly he realized he was seeing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking, heat-ravaged forest with utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">clarity. His sight more nearly normal than</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been at any time since the original</seg><seg type="columnLine">head injury. But remembering how swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and completely the blindness could over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take him, he tried not to waste a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must hurry," he kept telling himself</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in desperation. "If the blindness comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I get free, I'll never get away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strained to break the bonds on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists, only to learn the true extent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his weakness. His powerful body had ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed punishment which would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed even most strong men, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven it to its outermost limit and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could go no further. He gasped for breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the feeling of a trapped animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed in upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he started to resume the strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gles which he knew beforehand were use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, his eye fell on the feathered shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one of the arrows buried in the zebra.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had stabbed low in the pony's belly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by working his hands and feet as far to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left as possible, he brought his fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the shaft. With infinite difficulty, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tugged the barb out of the flesh. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reversed it, pressing the feathered end</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the wound so that the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck upward in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He held the thongs binding his wrists</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the sharp edges of the arrow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading, sawing them up and down. Sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran off his face and shoulders in rivulets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was agonizingly slow work, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow kept turning under the pressure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A burning tree came crashing down, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming branches reaching to within fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards of the White Lord. The fire ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward from the tree like a yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, lighting the surrounding brush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor kept himself at his task and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally the bonds shredded apart. He tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thongs from his wrists, braced his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands against the inert zebra and worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet free. Sparks had set the grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him to smouldering, so with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankles still bound, he had to crawl to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">safer point before he could stop to untie</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last of the knots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to think where he might find</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven from both the flames and the Ta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toga. At the rate it was going, the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">would reach the canyon within a few more</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours. Surely, if there was any safe place</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a man to hide, N'Geeso would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it. He thought of how delighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duran would be to see him driven back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the canyon, and he swore to himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he'd die before letting himself go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and surrender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unable to arrive at any plan, he stum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled haphazardly through the smoke-filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle, putting as much distance as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible between him and the dead zebra.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Tatoga would follow the zebra's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks in the hope of recapturing him. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and throat were parched, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every passing minute his thirst grew more</seg><seg type="columnLine">unendurable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This thirst is one torment I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to suffer," he hold himself. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a small spring near their camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"At least, I can drink my fill a last</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice he had to hide to avoid Tatoga</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching parties and he was almost done</seg><seg type="columnLine">for when he finally stumbled through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned camp and went on a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards to locate the spring. He fell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stomach and buried his face in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold, fresh water. When he had drunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fill, he plunged his arms full length</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the coolness. Then he sat up, put</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs into the spring and gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid his whole body into the small, clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">basin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO his surprise the water came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his chin. He hadn't thought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring was more than three feet deep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He found also that the basin was shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a small-necked bottle, with the area</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the surface mushrooming out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roomy chamber where the water had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn a softer strata of rock away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He climbed out of the spring, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost in deep thought for a moment. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">man might survive the fire if he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage to stay at the bottom of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold water until the timber around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place was burned out. The spring flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to keep the water from boiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's lips set in a hard, determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. He hurried back to the camp, picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up three extra blowguns left by the pyg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies, found a Tatoga knife which one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them had carried as a souvenir, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered up the remains of their food</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock. Then he hid in the brush near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within an hour the fire had crept so</seg><seg type="columnLine">close he had to get in the water. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the trees and brush about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin to burn, and then closing his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly about the mouthpiece of a blow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, he sat down on the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring, leaving the other end of the hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, reedlike blowgun protruding about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an inch above the water. By breathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly enough to give the hot air time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool slightly before reaching his lungs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be able to survive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His body grew cold and cramped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chill water at first, but as the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the forest fire grew more intense, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring became lukewarm. He lost track</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time, giving his whole attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting sufficient oxygen into his aching</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs. When the air he breathed no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned his throat and the water about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him began to grow chill, he thrust his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head above the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours later he was able to wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the bank, climb out and lie down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About him on every side were smoulder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fires, beds of hot coals and acres of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white ash. Despite the heat, the exhausted</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord fell into a deep sleep as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as he stretched out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was mid-morning of the next day</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he awakened. He was entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in that eerie sea of desolation. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfasted on the food which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in the spring, opening with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife two cans which had come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parson's stock and rounding out the meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fruit and nuts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ate not because he was hungry, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to regain his strength. He sat dejectedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time, trying to figure out what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should do. He wasn't certain whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso had survived the Tatoga charge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he knew Duran wouldn't kill Helene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed hopeless for him to go alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Tatoga kraal, but he could think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of no other course to follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A single item brightened his dark out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">look: the blindness hadn't returned. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes smarted from the exposure to smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and water and his head wound pained</seg><seg type="columnLine">him badly, but his sight remained clear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parson's treatment might have taken ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect or, perhaps, just as the former doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">said could happen, Ki-Gor's eyes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally readjusted themselves. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord felt the second blow on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head actually was what had restored his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He moved cautiously at first, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found no sign of the Tatoga. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural they should believe he had perished</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fire. His anxiety about Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed him to greater boldness, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to travel openly instead of slowly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE OF THE JACKAL PRIESTESS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping from the cover of one rock to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached the site of the battle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he halted, surprised. The bodies of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead friends had been placed in a neat</seg><seg type="columnLine">line and covered with rocks. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture one wouldn't expect from Duran.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor stood by the graves, gripped by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him sounded the faint rattle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose gravel stirred by a footstep. Jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his reverie, his face went abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage as he spun, knife in hand, to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stalkers. The Tatoga had set a clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap, but they would learn how dear was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cost of closing it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a murderous, ravening killer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that moment. As he turned with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible speed of his, he saw the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tall, powerfully built warriors standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">like statues. He snarled, and leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight at them, knowing he must strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly before he was overwhelmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then abruptly his heels dug into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. He stopped, a queer, shaken look</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming over him. He blinked dully, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife arm slowly sinking to his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men were Masai warriors!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were his friends from the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle. They were the Congo's most feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors, whose steel legions had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">every tribe that had ever stood against</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And standing like an ebony giant among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was the greatest of the Masai war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs, their almost legendary leader, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge-thewed Tembu George.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor was stunned speechless for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. Times without number during</seg><seg type="columnLine">past weeks he had wished for these men</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. Now, like an incredible dream</seg><seg type="columnLine">come true, they stood before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did you know to come ?" he cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice hoarse with sudden feeling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw Tembu George's eyes widen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw how tense and strained were the men's</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces.

Ki-Gor asked, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed. "Why do you look at me so</seg><seg type="columnLine">queerly?

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-shrouded figure had come out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking desolation, come straight to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">graves of his dead fellows. The Masai</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unnerved, but a combination of love</seg><seg type="columnLine">and curiosity had brought them out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding to stare at the spirit of their de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A relieved grin touched Ki-Gor's dusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">features.

Then tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing along Gita's assistant, he led this</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked force on ahead of the main body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had the Tatoga prisoner lead them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bluff overlooking the ceremonial</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds. A scowl from Tembu George</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sufficed to make the man reveal the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of the waterfall, a huge earthen</seg><seg type="columnLine">dam with an outlet which could be closed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to shut off the flow of water. There also</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an opening into the Cave of Death</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending from the bluff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They captured three more of Gita's men</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bluff. They were the assistants</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrusted with cutting off the waterfall</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the chief wizard went into his mum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bo-jumbo act before the cave mouth. Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor left three of his own men to operate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dam and led the others down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made the witchdoctors show him</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Gita had hidden the stone image</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Momba-N'gar. Then he had his war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors drag it back to the front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave, replace it on its pedestal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They waited restively behind the thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering curtain of water until afternoon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then as their first signal that the ceremony</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beginning outside, they heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of the falls decrease, Ki-Gor drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men back far enough so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness and swirling mists would hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from view. He lined them up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular ranks, ten abreast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's hands gripped tight on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">borrowed Masai bow as he strained to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dwindling waters to the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">space beyond. At last the fall stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the black, swarming mass of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatoga lit by bright sunshine. They formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge semi-circle before the cave mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the hollow space in front of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sight which sent hot rage burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the -White Lord's veins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two stakes surrounded with dry fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood had been set up fifty yards apart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso was tied to one of the stakes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nanooko to the other. A witchdoctor with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flaming torch stood by each pile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between the stakes stood Helene and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gita. Helen's ankles and wrists were bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">by silver chains, and as an added indignity</seg><seg type="columnLine">a silver collar had been placed around her</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck joined to another chain which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pompous Gila held in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FACING the huge throng, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the cave, was the legless man</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted on a zebra. Sepah stood beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with arrogant pride, reveling in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominence. By the very set of Duran's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, Ki-Gor could see how he sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ored this moment of triumph. The neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boring chieftains were in the forefront of</seg><seg type="columnLine">SLAVE OF THE JACKAL PRIESTESS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd, and their frightened faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that already they were awed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dread leader of the Tatoga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Light the fires!" roared Duran. "Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cries of these two as they roast be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a warning to those who would oppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">Momba-N'gar. And when they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieked their last, then shall the marriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Gita and this woman who once be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to the weakling, Ki-Gor, be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered sealed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord strode out of the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the cave into the bright glare of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight on the wet rock. He raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow, and with swift deadliness lashed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow at the black who bent to light</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso's pyre. The missile caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the side, threw him over on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. The torch fell on the native's chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he bucked wildly trying to get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from under the flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the first man fell, Ki-Gor turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention to the witchdoctor leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fire the wood abut Nanooko. He drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arrow through the black's skull, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his body fell forward on the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where he had held his torch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor slid a third arrow into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow. The whole attention of the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been so fixed on the legless man that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly a black had previously glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave. But now like a giant, dull-witted</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster with unnumbered eyes, the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">throng saw Ki-Gor and momentarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">froze. Not a tongue seemed to move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look you on the true image of Momba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'gar behind me," shouted Ki-Gor, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you have turned against your chief-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, your friends and yourselves for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotten, evil killer who is no more a god</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the mangiest dango!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gita stood with bulging eyes, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the unbelievable sight of a dead man</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearing out of nowhere to strike down</seg><seg type="columnLine">men with his bow. Then he made a leap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to get behind Helene. But for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his strange, unearthly calm, the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord was too fast for the wizard. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spitted Gita on an arrow like the pig he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, twirled him over as he leaped so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he died beside the girl he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to possess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duran had turned in his saddle, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunderstruck as the others. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">went hideous with hate when he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Lord. Once more Ki-Gor had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wriggled through his hands, returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake the belief of the natives in him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duran didn't suspect that Ki-Gor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">allies, but thought this was only one more</seg><seg type="columnLine">example of his audacity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He lies," screamed the furious Duran.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is another sneaking trick by which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tries to cheat you of glory and riches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forward, guards! This time we will slay</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cur before the eyes of the crowd and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make certain he is dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A confused uproar broke from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatoga. Some among them perhaps had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden doubts about the legless man, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">few could think straight in that moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had grown used to obeying the leg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less man, and he had cunningly cast his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell of evil over them, buying their loy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alty with his promises of the greatness</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was to be theirs. In a choice between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor and Duran, it was Duran alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">who offered them tangible benefits for</seg><seg type="columnLine">following him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The legless man swung his zebra and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurred at Ki-Gor, tearing a throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick from the belt at his waist as he rode.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He crouched low so the zebra's head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck would protect him from Ki-Gor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows. Behind him his personal, guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed forward at a run, and warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke out of the crowd to follow them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing this vast mass of men rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in upon the White Lord, Helene screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him to get away. She, too, thought her</seg><seg type="columnLine">beloved mate had come alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Ki-Gor heard Helene's voice, he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sign. Unmoving, he waited, his nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed eyes fastened on the zebra. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow in his hands was bent to Its further-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most point, the arrow straining for re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw the legless man suddenly rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, his right hand flung high for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast. This time Duran wasn't pitted against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blind man. Ki-Gor shot so swiftly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly seemed to aim. He easily could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed Duran, but he didn't. Only the feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his fingers around the legless man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat would satisfy the White Lord. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of inflicting a fatal wound, he shat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered Duran's wrist so that the throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick fell harmlessly to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duran was almost on Ki-Gor then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurring the zebra with insane rage. Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor held the bow like a club. He ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered the pony across the head, causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it to swerve slightly. Then he came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a great bound, caught Duran in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and dragged him from the saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They rolled over and over on the wet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slippery rock, beating and tearing at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other with insensate fury. The grotesque,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutish Duran fought with the strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bull ape, but there was no denying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stored-up rage which fired the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord with superhuman strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor hammered the man's hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet head with rocking blows, gouging</seg><seg type="columnLine">away skin and flesh each time he struck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with the speed of a cobra, his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot around Duran's thick neck. Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled to his knees, the tremendous muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his back and shoulders swelling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the killing pressure he exerted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Duran's guards sprinted across the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge, racing to break the White Lord's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-hold. They dared not throw their</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears for fear of killing their master.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then out of the mist-shrouded darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cave charged Ki-Gor's men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bluff shook with their thunderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle-cry as they smashed into the startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tatoga guards. And like a tremendous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth-shattering echo, from the far end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the clearing came the answering battle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry of the main force of pygmy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masai warriors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a grain field whipped by storm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tatoga shuddered under the impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that coordinated attack. They had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to rally or make a stand against</seg><seg type="columnLine">those wild, cheering warriors pouring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them. The Tatoga horde splintered</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart, and into every avenue that opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove the huge, fierce Masai and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly pygmies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO fierce an onslaught could not long</seg><seg type="columnLine">be endured. Those Tatoga fortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to get away, fled for their lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the forest, but the great bulk of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw down their arms and surrendered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor stood wide-legged at the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cave, watching the finish of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle. His muscles trembled with weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness now that his rage had died out. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet lay the body of the legless man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoid at last of the evil spirit which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought ruin and death to so many.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blue, distorted face and protruding</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue proclaimed the manner of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A squad of the men who had been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave with Ki-Gor stood guard around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene. Similar squads had released</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso and Nanooko from the stakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor raised his hands over his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his allies prodded the beaten Tatoga</seg><seg type="columnLine">into silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have paid for your greed," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told them.

The huts that had formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a square facing onto the pool, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lily and feathery papyrus had grown, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashes. The giant trunks of the cotton trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still smouldering. The stench of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cay was in the fitful, shifting wind. Vul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures rose in flight as the two White men</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached and perched like medieval gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">goyles in the bare, charred branches of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. The hyena and jackal fled to cover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two white men surveyed the deso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation, their eyes cold, their lips bloodless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral was the first to speak: "Moth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er of-!" he swore. "Could she be among</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that carrion?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan winced. For him a man was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, alive or dead; black or white.

His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed with anger, then a vision of Ines</seg><seg type="columnLine">da Cunha as he had last seen her, smiling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vividly alive, rose before his eyes.

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went, his eyes explored the debris. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw no discarded weapons. The people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mission had little warning. The dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay close to where the doors of their huts</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been, as if struck down as they rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at the first alarm. He paused, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon the body of a dead Makua,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently the only loss suffered by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiding impi. The warrior had died of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangulation; strong hands has throttled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the life out of him. Turcan thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Father Furtado, the powerful chaplain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station. His eyes scanned the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A TRAIL like that made by a body</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged over the ground, led them</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the pool. A white-robed figure lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">face down among the reeds at the margin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pond, its lower half submerged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. Turcan dropped on his knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the body. Blood had soaked through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white habit. It was still wet. Gently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5--Jungle Stories--Spring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan turned the body over. As he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, the monk groaned. In the mud-caked</seg><seg type="columnLine">features Turcan recognized Father Fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tado.

Besides, have you thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they would do to the tax collector of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angoche if they got their hands on him?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">De Cabral laughed: "Are you trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">frighten me, Turcan?

We will send the first nigger we</seg><seg type="columnLine">come across back to Laurenco Marques</seg><seg type="columnLine">with news of the raid. To do otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be to lose precious time. If we can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get porters, we follow the impi alone."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan smiled inwardly. He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how long the Portuguese dandy would</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand up to the fast gruelling trek that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ahead of them. Yet he recognized de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cabral's logic; Moreover he saw that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed de Cabral since the raid had cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off from the supplies he had hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to obtain at Umzinto. He was another</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle; another back to carry a load, at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time. De Cabral had shown no weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness so far. He--Turcan glanced at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion sharply. De Cabral's eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">intent on his face and he felt uncomfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, as if his thoughts had been read.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said he and, turning on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heel, led the way back up the hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They made camp in a glade on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the kopj. As darkness came the vul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, hyenas--the whole scavenger pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jungle fought over their obscene</seg><seg type="columnLine">feast. Over the red embers of their fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan talked, more to shut his ears to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bedlam on the other side of the hill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than for the want of companionship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I told you," he was saying, "I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked by a Makua at Laurenco.

Now Father Fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tado spoke of a half-caste called Bosi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">go-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Holy S'aints!" De Cabral slapped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thigh. "A half-caste--Bosigo!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan's eyes narrowed: "D'you happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know the man, senhor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral looked surprised. "No," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged. "But I see a connection between</seg><seg type="columnLine">your attacker and Bosigo. But go on, sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hor. What other conclusion have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn? For instance, where is the impi</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan's lips twitched.

We may catch up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him within three or four days. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--well, we'll cross the bridge when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hm-m," de Cabral mused. "I am in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clined to agree, but for one thing. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rouse the Government more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">this attack upon Umzinto. It is a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">station. He could not have hoped for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">captives. It makes him a fool, senhor,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan shook his head. "Not if he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ines da Cunha was there. His Excellency</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ready to negotiate before he knew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. Ines da Cunha is his safe conduct</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wherever he's going. She's as good as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grant to settle wherever he pleases in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mozambique."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral was gazing into the fire, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown between his eyes:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he said slowly. "It does fit to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. He sent one of his Makuas to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack you because he knew your reputation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was afraid." He spread his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But how could he know of your coming?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan shrugged. "A house-boy at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Residency maybe. They get to know more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than most Whites suspect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral's smile was sardonic. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratifying to know that you do not lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fault at my feet, senhor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm giving you doubtful benefit," Tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can retorted.

"By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saints, you are right! That I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done.

Turcan planned to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Impambanyoni. The stream joined with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Komati several miles below Komati</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poort, a narrow pass through the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains into the Transvaal. Above the fly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp country native kraals were more</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous. And since the population was</seg><seg type="columnLine">correspondingly denser, it was the logical</seg><seg type="columnLine">route for Bosigo and his slave column to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow. Moreover, in the Transvaal there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a ready market for slaves or appren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tices, as the Boers called them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They passed through the ruins of Um-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zinto. The vultures were still fighting over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bodies of the slain. De Cabral was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lead. Turcan saw him stop suddenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">De Cabral's colt flashed from its holster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As Turcan ran up to him he fired twice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ugly--!" said he. He gave Turcan a</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer smile. "That makes two less of them,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">senhor," he added and walked on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan looked toward the spot from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the birds had risen in flight, measur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the distance with his eye. It was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twenty paces. Curious, he walked over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the spot and looked down on two head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less vultures. There was a grim smile on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips when he turned to follow de Cabral.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Portuguese talked and dressed like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dandy, but there was nothing effeminate in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way he handled his weapons. Nor did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, Turcan felt sure, do anything without</seg><seg type="columnLine">some dark purpose behind it. His demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stration of markmanship was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere braggadocio; it was a covert warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--his way of saying that two were go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the jungle, but only one was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first village they came to--a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">one--was deserted. Its inhabitants had ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously fled into the bush. For Turcan it</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant that they were on the right track.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently the villagers had been warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bosigo's approach and had scattered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two white men searched the half</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen huts for food. Turcan was careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave payment in coin for what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken on the hearth of the head man's hut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they began their march again, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing a westerly bend of the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dense cloud of smoke shot through</seg><seg type="columnLine">with flames rolling up out of the forest,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">warned them that they were close upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heels of the impi. It was the third day</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trek and they had climbed to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eminence commanding a view of the val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley of the Impambanyoni, where it made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sweeping bend Southward. They looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon the roof of the jungle sloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to the East like a patchwork carpet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The burning kraal lay on the near side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bend, about five miles distant. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment the two men watched the smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in silence, each busy with his own thoughts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">De Cabral broke the silence:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Soon we must cross the bridge you</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke of, Senhor," said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan nodded assent: "It looks like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fair-sized kraal. They could muster three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four hundred warriors. That means</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bosigo's in strength."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True, or he would not have attacked,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">de Cabral agreed. "And now we approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of our trek; I wonder what two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men can do against an impi!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan smiled. "It's too late to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that," said he. "We won't do anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impi knows about, that's sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral looked at him curiously. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a plan, senhor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan shook his head.

The river, bursting</seg><seg type="columnLine">full-born from its womb, in the Longwe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountains, swept around it and leaped over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red rock in a crystal stream; the bould-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers that barred its impetuous dash to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea, had been fretted into weird shapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and formed a natural ford of stepping</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A six-foot stockade of thorn bush woven</seg><seg type="columnLine">between pointed stakes had encircled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village with the river flowing between.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">places it looked as if it had been hacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to prevent the spread of flames.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was not a body to be seen. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled Turcan until his eye was caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a white ostrich plume bobbing among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks in the river.

Maybe we've found the bridge we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral's eyebrows arched: "Is read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the drums one of your accomplish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, senhor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan ignored his sarcasm: "Bosigo is</seg><seg type="columnLine">still on this side of the river; the villagers</seg><seg type="columnLine">are on the other. I'm going to cross over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see what they're up to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They crossed the river, jumping from</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone to stone. A shaded path led along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank between gigantic cotton woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fragrant bedamier trees with mango-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like flowers. There was a wild beauty about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place. Turcan had visited the kraal</seg><seg type="columnLine">once before, years ago. As they pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way forward, he strove to recall its</seg><seg type="columnLine">name. It did not occur to him until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a streamlet that fed a deep pool</seg><seg type="columnLine">of clear water. The water-lily and lotus</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated upon its surface and around its</seg><seg type="columnLine">margin; among the reeds huge balls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">amber and orange-colored blossoms scented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. Then Turcan remembered Aman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zimtoti, the Place of Sweet Waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little way beyond the p'ool the beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tom-toms burst upon them and pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently the wild refrain of a war chant. Night</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had come swiftly. Through the thinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees they saw flashes of fire-light and</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, laping figures. There was raw, naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty in the scene; a joyous play of mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles; a frenzy of savage exaltation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two white men watched the dancers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a clump of bush; then Turcan led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way into the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one noticed their approach until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came within the circle of fire-light. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman pointed and screamed. Silence fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed. The circle of dancers opened be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore them. On the far side of the ring a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall figure rose from among a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-plumed Indunas. He came toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with lithe, swinging stride; his white</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumes tossing and the tails of his leopard</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin whipping about his muscular legs. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was young, in the first years of his man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood. He stood before the two white men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyeing each of them closely. His gaze came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest on Turcan. He raised his assegai:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know you," said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TURCAN studied the young chief's face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaving the threads of memory: "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you, chief," said he at last. "But when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew you before your father wore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopard-skin and the weapons you carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">were toys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is so, lord." His eyes flashed proudly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But now I wear his kroos. I hold his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons. It was not child's play at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river yesterday."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My eyes' saw that, Umbesi."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Umbesi's teeth showed in a wide grin:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, you have not forgotten us, lord,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are true men as the red berries on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vine, that they should be forgotten, chief ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Umbesi's grin broadened: "It is true</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they are not," said he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You did men's work at the ford, Um-</seg><seg type="columnLine">besi."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The youngster needed no more prompt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He struck a savage blow at an imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inary foe: "Many died at the river," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">boasted. "We drove them back like cattle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They did not know us!" His voice rose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They did not know that we, the Zamaro,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the spawn of Chaka, the Elephant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spears flashed in the moonlight. Young</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors pressed about their chief; their</seg><seg type="columnLine">applause, a long-drawn "Aie-e-e" drowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"SLAYER BY STEALTH"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Umbesi swaggered: "We drove them</seg><seg type="columnLine">back," he shouted. "They are hyenas! They</seg><seg type="columnLine">skulk in the bush across the river----"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And what does Umbesi do?" Turcan</seg><seg type="columnLine">stemmed the torrent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He follows the hyena to see that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not cross to his side of the river, lord."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan's smile was disparaging: "Is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, O spawn of Chaka?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Umbesi scowled. He looked crest-fallen:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What more could be done?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan moved close to him so that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ears might catch his words. Said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly: "I, too, am at war with Bosigo. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">has slain Government people. Show me his</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp and I will show you how to put your</seg><seg type="columnLine">name in every man's mouth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Umbesi blinked at him owlishly. He bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed a command. The tom-toms began</seg><seg type="columnLine">their rhythmic beating; Dust rose beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamping feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral caught Turcan's sleeve as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to follow Umbesi: "What is all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this palaver?" he wanted to know. "Nigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">gibberish has no meaning for me." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it sound as if understanding was</seg><seg type="columnLine">degrading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan shook his arm free: "Go find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to sleep," said he. "You'll know soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Umbesi led Turcan to the bank of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. At a point several hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">up-stream he pointed across the swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. No more than a hundred yards sepa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated them from Bosigo's outposts. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of watch fires flickered among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, but it was a mile down stream that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan found what he was looking for--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slave train and the cattle. Evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were camped deeper in the jungle at</seg><seg type="columnLine">some distance from the river's bank. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires were visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the lowing of the cattle he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatches of a song sung in chorus--a plain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive air in which he thought he recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twenty-third Psalm. The singers would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the natives captured at Umzinto. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ines da Cunha among them? Or a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">up-stream with the impi ? Perhaps no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a few hundred yards separated him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the girl who, during the long trek</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the jungle, had come to sweeten</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day-dreams from which he had sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to banish her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan's eyes swept over the swift river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought of swimming it to reconnoitre</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp. But he could think of no dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guise that could make an African out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white man. Discovery would be certain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a while he beckoned Umbesi to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the young chief squatted beside him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are many cattle yonder, Umbesi.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is a pity that they should fill the bellies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bosigo's warriors. He will grow strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the meat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Umbesi grunted: "Some of our cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">are among the herd, lord."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I were with Bosigo yonder," Turcan</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, "And you were with the cattle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Umbesi, could I see you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Umbesi laughed: "No, lord, a man could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see so far through the trees."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True, Umbesi. And it is also true that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if twenty warriors swam the river they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could drive the cattle back to the ford and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bosigo would not see it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young chief sprang to his feet: "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be swift and silent. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan smiled: "We will make sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he does not. You will gather your people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An induna will lead them up-stream. Bos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">igo will see them. He will follow them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn the meaning of it. He will send a</seg><seg type="columnLine">runner back to the herdsmen to tell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break camp and follow him. But we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be between Bosigo and the herd. We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch the runner. The herdsmen will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that Bosigo is marching, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gap between them and Bosigo is wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will strike. Is it good, Umbesi?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it is good--good!" Umbesi stamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground in his excitement: The indunas</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not whisper among themselves; saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I am too young for the leopard-skin."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan patted his shoulder: "Go, show</seg><seg type="columnLine">them your wisdom!" he urged. "And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the council is over, come to' me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I go, lord."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan made his way back to the clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. He found de Cabral snoring beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the fires, in spite of the uproar</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirling about him. He shook the Portu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guese awake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral listened, bleary-eyed, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan outlined the plan of attack. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan had finished he sat scowling into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire, evidently turning the plan over in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind. Turcan was not surprised when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not approve of your plan, senhor."</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Show me a better," challenged Turcan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">De Cabral stroked his beard: "How far</seg><seg type="columnLine">are we from Ressano Gareia, senhor?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thirty or forty miles, south-east."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral nodded: "So I thought. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have his Excellency's commission. We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">use it. You will go to Gareia and return</seg><seg type="columnLine">with soldiers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan's eyes widened. "I'm damned if</seg><seg type="columnLine">that doesn't sound like an order," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is precisely that, senhor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TURCAN threw his head back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. "Oh, the devil, you say!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look, de Cabral. Innes da Cunha wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">live five minutes after Bosigo saw the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier. She's his safe conduct; his pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection against the very thing you suggest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought you understood that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral squinted at him. "That is your</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory. But you speak of theory as if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fact, you are so damned cock-sure!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps your enthusiasm for the heroic</seg><seg type="columnLine">role you have cast for yourself blinds you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to who is in authority here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan's smile was provocative: "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't thought of that," said he. "But now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wonder if it's your idea to send me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gareia and act out the part yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral got to his feet with an oath:</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tapped his breast pocket: "Must I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind you of his Excellency's commission ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Both you and his Excellency can go</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumb to hell! I'm crossing the river before</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral's eyes narrowed. His colt</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed from its holster:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Senhor." The softness of his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">heightened the menace in it. "You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been insubordinate! You have outlived</seg><seg type="columnLine">your usefulness!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke off with a start. Umbesi re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning from the council, had crept up be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him. The broad blade of his assegai</seg><seg type="columnLine">pricked de Cabral's spine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is your will, lord ?" he asked over</seg><seg type="columnLine">de Cabral's shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Drop your gun, de Cabral," said Tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral's eyes blazed. He bit his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the blood came. Umbesi's blade bored</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his flesh. The gun dropped from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled but his grey eyes were cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Senhor," said he, "You were</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral folded his arms. "No," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he. "Men of my blood do not settle their</seg><seg type="columnLine">differences by beating each other with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists.

"But I've no desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill you. I would rather have had you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come with me tonight; but now, you'll un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand, I couldn't risk showing you my</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. You'll leave your weapons here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay on this side of the river, under guard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If things go wrong, I'll answer for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral's face twisted into a grimace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hate: "My time will come, Turcan. Holy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Saints! I swear I-" He choked with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">impotent rage as Umbesi's spear urged him</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By midnight Umbesi's people were wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out along the river's bank. Turcan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked for noise and Umbesi had taken him</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally. The line of march was a tumult,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom-toms throbbed; the voices of women</seg><seg type="columnLine">and children shrilled above the bass of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors' chant and, as distance stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disorderly mass, the wild song lost its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythm and broke up into toneless uproar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HALF a mile up-stream Turcan, Um-</seg><seg type="columnLine">besi and twenty young Zamaros halt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed at a bend in the river where the current</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not so swift. As the uproar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marchers faded, Turcan led his little band</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the river. One warrior was posted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a guard. Turcan left his rifle and ammu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nition in his care; then he stripped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waded out into the cold stream. Umbesi</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his warriors followed him, one by one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swimming on his back, with his clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a colt held over his head, made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">going hard for Turcan. The current bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">him down stream, and he gained the oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site bank far below his starting point. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">halo of mist ringed a pale disc of a moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan shivered as he dressed. A damp</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog was settling over the river; he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see only a few feet along the bank. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoot of an owl told him that Umbesi had</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed above him. He picked his way for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward in the direction of the sound. War-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors appeared out of the surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom. Soon all were gathered about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief and Turcan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As had been arranged Umbesi and three</seg><seg type="columnLine">"SLAYER BY STEALTH»</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors went upstream to intercept Bos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">igo's runner. The remainder grouped them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves about Turcan, shivering in the chill</seg><seg type="columnLine">night air. He directed them to start a fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hollow in the river's bank. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fear of the jungle at night and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned their minds from it with tales of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting and war. While they talked he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to snatch an hour's sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Umbesi and his companions returned an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour before dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is done, lord," said the young chief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bosigo marches up river as you said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good!" said Turcan. "Bring the run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. I will talk with him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Umbesi and the warriors looked at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aie!" said Umbesi. "Only the witch</seg><seg type="columnLine">men can talk with him now, lord."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan shook his head reprovingly: "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stupid to spear him, Umbesi. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">will you learn your enemy's strength if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence the tongue that would tell you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Umbesi hung his head and stood silent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go now," said Turcan. "Make your</seg><seg type="columnLine">men ready. See to it that they are silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we come to the slave camp or I, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will think that you are too young to wear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leopard-skin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light was better in the morning. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist which had overcast the sky turned into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nimbus of clouds. Umbesi led the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">back along the trail broken by Bosigo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">impi. His Zamaros dogged his heels, glid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing swiftly between the gnarled mopani</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spiked clumpjies. The lowing of cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the thin spirals of smoke from dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires warned of their near approach to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking down on the kraal, Turcan</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that there was a look of perma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nence about it. The herdsmens' hut which</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the centre was well built and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that the ground had been staked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more huts. But he counted only twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">Makua squatting about the fires. Against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bush wall on the far side thirty or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks, men and women, lay huddled to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether in sleep. The women were fully clad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sure sign of missionary influence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan had no doubt that they were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">singers he had heard the night before. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ines da Cunha among them? Turcan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse quickened. If his luck was still with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he'd have her safe on the other side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river in less than two hours. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the military could deal with Bosigo and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">impi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Zamaros, crouched behind clumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thorn bush, were showing signs of rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness. The muscles under their velvet</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin tensed and their grim faces set into</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce lines as Turcan drew his colt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun its cylinder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led them forward, bent double, dodg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from bush to bush until the kraal's wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">was between them and the dozing Makua.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He waited until Umbesi had marshalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">them into a compact group, then nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the young chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Umbesi led the dash across the gap that</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated them from the thorny gate of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kraal. Their battle-cry: "Bu-la-la! Bu-la-</seg><seg type="columnLine">la!" shattered the silence as they burst in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rushed upon the amazed herdsmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several of the Makua with the wits</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared out of them, broke and ran for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite gate with a dozen Zamaros yell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at their heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan saw two Makua go down under</seg><seg type="columnLine">Umbesi's flashing spear. The others flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">down their weapons and waited passively</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the death stroke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let them live!" Turcan's voice rang out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the yells of the victors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Umbesi looked shocked; he stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan with his assegai poised:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is your wisdom, boy?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan. He pointed to the Makuas. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are hands to weed your meale patch. Spears</seg><seg type="columnLine">to defend you if you treat them well."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Umbesi lowered his spear: "Makua</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs! Stir up the fires; prepare food!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan smiled. Umbesi was a good type,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought. He walked over to the group</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the far side of the kraal. The hope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding Ines da Cunha died still-born as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan's gaze swept over the full-bosomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">native women. He singled out one he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen at the mission:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mary Agu," said he. "I seek the Sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horita Cunha."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Negress shook her head: "She is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not here, senhor.

He walked toward the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut with his head bent. The gall of disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointment ran through his veins like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbing drug. He felt suddenly, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmingly tired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan looked up as Umbesi came run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning towards him: "A runner has come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my people," panted Umbesi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does he say, Umbesi?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The White lord whom they guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">has gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gone! Where?" demanded Turcan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He broke from his guard and swam</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, lord."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan's lethargy dropped from him like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cloak. It flashed across his mind instant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly that de Cabral would not cross the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach Ressano Gareia. He had gone over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Bosigo! He had meant to do so from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning. There was some connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two. Turcan knew that de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cabral would do anything for money and</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. He was convinced that the sneering</seg><seg type="columnLine">young nobleman had sold himself over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bosigo. Turcan caught Umbesi's arm in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard grip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The White lord has betrayed us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Umbesi. Bosigo will turn back. We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be but twenty against him. See now, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women cannot swim the river. We must go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the ford at Amanzimtoti. Call your</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors quickly, Umbesi. Quickly!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the cattle, lord?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leave them, Umbesi. If we are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the river soon we will all be food for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hyenas!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite Turcan's driving, an hour was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost before he got the Zamaros on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">march. Bosigo, he reasoned, would not send</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole of his impi in pursuit. Fifty pick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed warriors, perhaps. It was all a ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of time, and the time it had taken de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cabral to get to Bosigo was an indeter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minable factor. Moreover, he had only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough idea of the distance to the ford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the sun climbed over the trees Tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can scanned the trail with anxious eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The river seemed to wind interminably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whenever he asked Umbesi how far they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had still to go, the answer was the same:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not far now, lord."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a little before noon as they rounded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp bend he recognized the clearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Umbesi had camped. Looking down</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream he saw the first of the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">making her way cautiously across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">causeway of stones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was slow work. S'ome of the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">balked at the crossing and had to be carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the slippery stones. There was a dip</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the trail near the bend formed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder of rock. Turcan walked toward it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he reached the top he saw whit©, plumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossing above the scrub. In a moment the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first of the Makuas came into full view,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging around the bend with a swift,</seg><seg type="columnLine">running gait. Turcan dashed back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford. The last of the mission people were</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing over. He fired a shot from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">colt to draw Umbesi's attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Swim, Umbesi!" he yelled at the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his voice. "Swim for it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw the Zamaros dash for the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plunge in. The first Makua came over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ridge and catching sight of Turcan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged down with a wild yell. He pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward as Turcan began to shoot. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall did not check the others. They swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on Turcan like a wave. He emptied</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun into them, then ran for the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An assegai whizzed past his ear. A knob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerry thudded at the nape of his neck. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrent roared in Turcan's ears and swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Turcan first became conscious he</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted the fetid stench of putrid flesh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the itching sting of vermin. He lay, bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and foot, upon the hide of an animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">not long dead. Nothing was visible in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness, but as he writhed convulsively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he caught a glimpse of moonlight. Against</seg><seg type="columnLine">its pale radiance he traced the vague out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of the curved roof above him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time he lay still. Outside he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the river tumbling over the rocks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the murmur of many voices. From their</seg><seg type="columnLine">number he judged he was in Bosigo's camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought bitterly of de Cabral's treach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery. Would he use da Cunha's authority--</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitewash the blood spilled at Umzinto and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign a shameless treaty for the release of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ines da Cunha?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS the rays of the sun slanted over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, two stalwart Makuas entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hut. They dragged him out and slashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bonds. They led him forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everywhere about him there was fev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">"SLAYER BY STEALTH"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">erish activity. .Axes rang on timber;</seg><seg type="columnLine">machetes slashed out in the bush. A staked</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of unusual strength and construction</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being built around the campsite. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear to Turcan that Bosigo contemplated</seg><seg type="columnLine">permanent settlement on the banks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Impambanyoni. Bosigo's house resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a European bungalow more than a native</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut. It had windows, cane doors and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least three separate compartments. Tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can was led into the central room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bosigo sat on a stool beside a crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. A leopard skin was draped over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful, naked shoulders. He wore hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">trousers and shoes. His white skin showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a yellowish tinge blotched with black, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind his small black eyes lurked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter hatred of the outcast. Turcan's gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned from him, passed over de Cabral,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing at the other end of the table, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to rest on the lovely face of the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">who stood by his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan saluted her after the Portuguese</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion, with a stiff bow saying: "I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped to meet you under happier circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances, Senhorita."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Except for the worn appearance of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, Ines da Cunha looked none the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse for her long trek from Umzinto.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She wore a bodice with puffed sleeves</seg><seg type="columnLine">trimmed with lace that had once been white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a long full skirt with a waist-line that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan could span with his both hands. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">courtesied to him as sedately as if she were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the reception hall of the Residencia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are not too late to be of service to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, if it pleases you, senhor," said she.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HER "us" sounded ominous in Tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can's ear. Out of the corner of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye he saw the scowl on Bosigo's face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given the half-caste no more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">casual glance and guessed that Bosigo felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that more was his due. He would have gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">on talking if the half-caste had not inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Senhor," said Bosigo in a booming</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice and in good Portuguese: "You may</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder why you are alive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is something to wonder at," answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan, "With so many dead in your path."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bosigo eyed him up and down, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">praisingly.

The girl slowed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace and he did not know how far it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Bosigo's kraal to the ford at Aman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zimtoti. At any moment their escape might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be discovered. Bosigo would guess that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make for the ford and it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy for him to head them off there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a narrow bend in the river where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall reeds grew out into the stream, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and pointed to the opposite side:</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'd be safer on the other side," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know you can swim, Senhorita."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl looked across to the far bank;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The current is swift but it is not far,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan looked at her doubtfully: "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a float of reeds," said he. "We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">swim together."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl's eyes flashed at him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness: "Very well, go make your float,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said she.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan was busy with his knife when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle fell at his side. Startled, he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up quickly. A white, nymph-like form</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed across his line of vision. In an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant it disappeared among the reeds. Tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can stared with his mouth open. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw her swimmfng strongly for the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite bank. He grabbed up the bundle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes she had thrown to him and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the bank. The snapping of a twig</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him face about with his nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">taut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral stood a few paces from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two men stood silent for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes locked.

De Cabral's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was vibrant. "You will stay on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TURCAN did not answer for a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face was expressionless but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse raced and the blood pounded in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears.

The fleet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing seconds were like a bridge across</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblivion, crumbling at his feet. De Cabral</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gloating,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think we have come to that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge yet," said Turcan coolly.

"I owe</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to your cleverness, but now I have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">further need of it. Start walking back up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path, senhor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan stood his ground. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint smile on his lips. "You talk too much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">de Cabral," said he. "You made a mistake</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you followed us alone. You should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have brought your executioner along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you.

He edged forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DE CABRAL'S' face was bloodless. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes shifted nervously. Turcan did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not give him time to think. He talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan cut him short. "A man can</seg><seg type="columnLine">choose to die, you forget that, de Cabral.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'd kill, but you haven't got the guts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> De Cabral stooped suddently and grab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed up a heavy branch at his feet.

With a yelp of pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rage, de Cabral swung at Turcan with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his club. The branch broke over Turcan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right shoulder, paralyzing his arm. De</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cabral came at him, kicking and flailing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists. Turcan went down. Intent upon beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his victim into unconsciousness, de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cabral turned to look for his club. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbness was leaving Turcan's arm. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">de Cabral turned, he was getting to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsteadily. The Portuguese rushed at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan ducked under a savage blow; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms wound around the other's waist. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed to the ground and rolled toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river's bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once they broke apart and circled each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, gulping the cool air into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">parched lungs. De Cabral was maneuver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to get Turcan into the path of moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, himself into the shadow. Turcan</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalked him warily toward the river's bank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">De Cabral sprang as Turcan's foot caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a vine. He faked falling and his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped around de Cabral's waist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted him bodily. As he braced himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw, the overhanging bank crumbled un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der his feet and they slid into the swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. Sinking rapidly, Turcan fought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break the strangle-hold de Cabral had about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his neck. He felt a sickening jar as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current dashed him against a shelf of rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The grip about his neck slackened as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the surface with bursting lungs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, he saw de Cabral's body roll over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf and go bobbing down stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE fighting madness left Turcan. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to run down the bank with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague idea of saving de Cabral. But his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruised legs stiffened. He fell. The muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his legs were knotted with cramp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was some time before Turcan felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to swim the river. He walked back up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, found the girl's scanty clothes, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he waded out into the icy water. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the other bank, he stretched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching limbs and rested. Then he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ines da Cunha, huddled naked among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reeds. He went in search of her, calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">her name softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A splash drew him toward the water's</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge. A white arm parted the reeds and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of very angry eyes flashed up at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the rim of the bank. "My clothes, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you please, senhor," she snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turcan grinned down at her. "I know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">how you feel," said he. "I'll drink the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn river before I'll swim it again."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turcan withdrew a bit. Evidently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl had hidden herself so well that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen nothing of the struggle on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite bank. When she came out, shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water from her long black hair, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still angry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the last time, senhor--" She broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">off as she caught sight of Turcan's swoollen</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and his left eye that was all the colors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a jungle flower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Senhor de Cabral," Turcan ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained laconically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl caught his arm, her eyes bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">with alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lopes!

He was a touring</seg><seg type="columnLine">German named Kurt Von Stern, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to buy some, coffee plantations for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his firm in Europe.

Then suddenly, the hot tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun literally bounced up over the horizon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shadows were swallowed by a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare of light, and at once it was hot. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamps drew in their searching tongues of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool fog and the jungles steamed and stank</seg><seg type="columnLine">again after the cool of the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even the animals shrank away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">all consuming heat of the sun.

The jungle cats gave up</seg><seg type="columnLine">their endless blood search and sought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, moist shade.

Jim cut in, that likeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin that was so characteristic of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading over his smooth shaven, rugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">features for a moment. He was hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately that young Helen, Bill White's</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing, happy tom-boy daughter Was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. The last time he had seen the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had been swinging swiftly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle trees on the end of a long liana, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ape, laughing and shouting with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer joy of living.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was doubt in Jim's tones as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he answered M'Kada.

The safari glimpsed whole packs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cowardly wild dogs, racing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tangle, all going toward the same des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tination that Jim Ford sought.

They shouted fierce, eager replies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered the points of their broad bladed</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears, loosened war clubs in their slings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingered the broad, sharp, bolo-like pangas</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging handy at their belts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chief M'Kada and these twenty big</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting men had marched on many a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">safari with Jim Ford--each had cause to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember the big planter with deep debts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gratitude for his many acts of friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liness toward them and their families. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fiercely loyal to him.

His gesture was eloquent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of defeat, and a groan that was a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixture of regret and fierce rage ran over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warriors following Jim Ford. Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed feelingly, paused for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully fingering the three lion's teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging on his left breast, then hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the slope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more the mysterious murder band</seg><seg type="columnLine">had struck, despite the war safari's furi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous drive to reach Bill White's plantation</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of it.

The smell of death was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong about the place and Jim snorted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his nostrils violently. The huge black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gray feathered scavenger birds were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only evidence of life on the plantation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They sounded their wild, skirling shrieks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flopped clumsily away to the limbs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bare, dead tree as the safari arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of the native help had disappeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in superstitious fear of the Akesi, of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead bwana and memsahib and unless they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were brought back soon the jungle would</seg><seg type="columnLine">reclaim its own; it would overrun all the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">planted area.

And he had seen how all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign, all tracks had disappeared in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep jungle within a half mile of the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crime in each case. But he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause in his work until the last shovelful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth had been heaped on the mound in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill White's plantation yard.

He jumped erect, stamped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">big bare foot on the leopard's track. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign not fit for make by animal," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled. "Made by Akesi man." Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big warrior's expression changed.

A hundred yards farther back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle he halted, glanced at his bwana,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed at a small boot track in the damp</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.

M'Kada nodded solemnly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe-so Akesi take girl, give to man</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pay for kill planters---make present.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But maybe not gone yet.

He lev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elled his great spear, raced off yelling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his warriors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim slumped to a seat on a fallen log.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The worst had happened--the thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had dreaded most, ever since this reign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of terror had started.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed at a distant line of small, half ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct volcanoes.

He was remembering the last time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen auburn haired, brown eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen.

"The monkeys do not run</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ground and risk being eaten by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopard when they have trees to travel in,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "Maybe the Akesi leopard men do</seg><seg type="columnLine">like their brothers, the monkeys, and travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time through the branches, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sign for us." He grabbed a long liana,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back as far as he could, then took off</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a run. His swing landed him on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick branch, ten feet above the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">6--Jungle Stories--Spriing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> M'Kada's eyes lighted up. "Wah! My</seg><seg type="columnLine">head is no better than the stupid chimpan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zee's," he growled. He tossed his big spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a warrior, seized a strong liana, took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick run and landed beside Jim. His sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes instantly noted a patch of scuffed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed moss on the limb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief growled, "It is as the bwana</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.

Then he was away through the jun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle, swinging from branch to branch like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big black ape.

"We two will kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who pays the murdering Akesi."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And at that moment, a big blue golokoto</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded his booming, yet liquid, "Wh-o-o-Q1</seg><seg type="columnLine">wh-o-o-o," from the jungle near by. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior stopped short in his tracks, listen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, waiting for the call to be repeated. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big blue pigeon remained silent. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the warriors grounded their spears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even M'Kada halted. There was a look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear in their eyes. It is well known by all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Congo, that if the golokoto calls but</seg><seg type="columnLine">once as a safari is about to trek, some man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that safari will die before night if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignores the warning, marches out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most of the warriors turned back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palaver ground, just left. They were sullen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashamed, for fear someone would think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were cowards. But they were tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing no chances, despite danger of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme insult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim stood looking at them for a minute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, without a word he strode off up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail alone, despite the pleas of the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors for him to turn back, wait until after</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim had covered maybe a mile when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior closed up behind him with a pant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rush. The big planter did not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">look around. He knew that this would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief M'Kada, unable to stand his bwana's</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt, willing to risk death--anything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than that. Jim smiled his crooked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly smile, but said nothing. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased . . . and relieved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had gone maybe a half mile to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether when Jim Ford stopped suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands flashed to his automatics. Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'Kada leaped back, his spear levelled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim had caught a brief flash of . a spotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow hide, in the jungle. "Maybe Akesi</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warriors," he snapped to M'Kada.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief crouched low, took one look</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the brush, grabbed Jim's shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tore out, back down the trail at top</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. He didn't go far. A hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he checked, wheeled, his back against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky cliff. Then his weird war yell burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his lips like the blast of a steam siren.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim spotted a black figure, partly cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered by a leopard skin. His right forty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasted, the warrior hit the ground, rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slashed for a moment, then lay still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THREE LION'S TEETH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A HALF dozen leopard skin clad war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors sifted through the jungle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came leaping to the attack. Chief M'Kada's</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear cut and slashed and jabbed furiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a grim smile on the big Masai's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. This was his business--fighting. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the breath of life to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim didn't waste a shot. He fired stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily, his aim sure, deadly. The Akesi</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't stand gun fire. Spears and knives</seg><seg type="columnLine">were their weapons; not guns. They broke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran swiftly for the jungle. The Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped after them, brought the flat of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">big spear blade around with terrific force</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knocked the last of the Akesi flat. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched over the man, his spear point</seg><seg type="columnLine">pricking the black skin over his heart. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two jabbered fiercely, back and forth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akesi warrior suddenly jerked his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">from under a pile of leaves, slashed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'Kada's leg with a dagger, trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hamstring him. The Chief leaped high, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without moving the point of his spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the man's chest, threw his whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight on the spear shaft. It was enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The warrior wilted, lifeless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a rush of bare feet on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail and Chief M'Kada's warriors charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. M'Kada stood, carefully cleaning his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great spear blade. He did not even glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his men. They took in the situation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and ran back to the palaver grounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The curse of the golokoto had not yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended. They were taking no chances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chief M'Kada, what did you get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that warrior?" Jim asked, swabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat from his head and neck, reloading</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magazines of his forty-fives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> M'Kada took his time about answering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But finally he said, "Akesi take little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Memsahib White for give to white sahib,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in land of fire. S'pose white sahib no want,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then give to fire priest in land of fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wah!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Ford wasted no time in further</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioning. "C'mon M'Kada," he growled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We've got a job cut out for us. I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fire priest and a white man to kill. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm in a hell of a hurry to get it done."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He led off up the trail at a jog-trot, Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'Kada close' behind him. Once the Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted, "More better run faster. Mebby-</seg><seg type="columnLine">so no hurry, you lose you woman--fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest cut heart out on big block of lava</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock from land of fire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim and the Chief moved swiftly climb-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, climbing steadily all afternoon. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rapidly getting closer to the land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. They could even catch an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiff of sulphurous smoke from the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terranean fires, up there. Sign of the Akesi</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very fresh but they did not glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warriors. Once, a half hour before</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark they crossed a rushing stream. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">men drank, then returned a mouthful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water to the torrent. It was good juju and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no man on safari neglected it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, Jim Ford saw something that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been watching for, for an hour. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thick clump of the dainty casurian trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">that grew close to the ground, up a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope from the trail that they followed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rapidly getting dark, and Jim turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that direction. "Here, we camp," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced simply to M'Kada. He knew that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under these casurians, they would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothered by the millions of mosquitoes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarmed in the air, while they rested and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept. The odor of the trees, though not</seg><seg type="columnLine">disagreeable, repelled the pests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They would get lost from their trail in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time, in the dark, lose all trace of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akesi they followed. Jim begrudged every</seg><seg type="columnLine">second that they rested, but he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be folly to try to go on in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. They opened the lunches that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried, and ate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From midnight on, Chief M'Kada</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched and listened for the approach of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his warriors, reasoning that they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come hurrying up the trail to overtake their</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief and their bwana, as soon as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse of the golokoto should let them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered to Jim once, "Those fools. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe in what they can not see, what their</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears will not kill. They are like little to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toes. But they are not cowards. No! They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are Masai fighting men!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Ford knew that he was right. "No,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "They are all brave warriors. Luck</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not with us, that's all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim slept lightly, in short cat naps. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was up, prowling the camp several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the night, impatient to be on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail again, almost wild with fear for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen. At about an hour before dawn he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was brought full awake by a low sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">guttural talk, coming from the trail below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He laid his hand lightly on M'Kada's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief was awake instantly. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no sound, did not move. Jim whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pered to him, told him what he had heard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'Kada asked, "My warriors?" But Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head. "It was not the Masai</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue. Too early for your men to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">here yet. We came a long way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two crouched in the dense shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the casurian trees, all their senses alert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their weapons ready, for a few minutes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they crept silently down toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail and waited. The men who had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the trail were out of sight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim and the Chief waited, listened for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a half hour. Then they heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men coming back up the trail. Jim held</seg><seg type="columnLine">his forty-five automatic, cocked and ready.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief M'Kada swung his mighty spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, stood behind a clump of bushes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was poised, set to attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim leaned close to the Chief. "Can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk the language of the Akesi?" he whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fit for talk it much good. Quick. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">live for come close. What I say?" M'Kada</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ask them, 'Where is their white bwana</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight, Chief.' Maybe we will learn some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wah!" They come. Now. Two Akesi."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chief M'Kada muttered a string of gut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tural words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INSTANTLY, both of the Akesi war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors answered, each thinking probably,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the other had asked the question. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them added, "Those cowardly Masai</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangoes must have turned back. But I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them following us yesterday. The fools are</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of the land of fire and the empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories of man eating devils there." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed shortly. It was the last sound that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ever made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cowardly Masai dangoes!" That did it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the proud M'Kada. His heavy, keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear blade flashed across in a vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging slash. The leopard man's head all</seg><seg type="columnLine">but left his shoulders. The other Akesi</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered a startled yell, commenced a bolt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim's forty-five shot a rstreak of orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored flame and the man collapsed. Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'Kada bathed his spear point in the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this man. Again, it was good juju.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chief turned to Jim. "Akesi dangoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">say their white bwana fit for stay in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, much close to land of fire, much</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to temple of fire priest," he said im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">portantly. "They say that palaver of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating devils is boon--all lies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So!" Jim snapped. "I've thought all</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, ever since the convention at Stanley-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ville that one of the white men who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, was behind this; maybe the Limey;</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe the Portugese, De Acosta. That the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderous fool was using the Akesi as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools--trying to drive us all to sell out</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheap. So, maybe, he'd like to build a pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erful coffee empire in the Congo, huh? I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">show him about that before I'm through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll teach him something about Africa that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he never read in a book."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Ford turned, hit the trail for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of fire at once, even though it was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely dark. Chief M'Kada followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">close on the heels of his bwana. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully cleaning the blade of his spear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jungle dropped away as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed. Great blocks of black lava forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to wind about among them, climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">over some, jump down to the trail again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both were panting, sweating from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough going, but they kept doggedly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half hour later the sudden tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn bloomed full blown in the east and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once the air was warm, and the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">came alive noisily. The huge blocks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumps of lava through which the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound started to radiate heat. Then Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped short at the edge of a huge bowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was about a half mile in diameter. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneaked closer, peered over the rim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place carefully. The steady rumbling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring, the hiss of escaping steam in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old crater was deafening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Below him the trail ran down steeply,</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding about snake-like among steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">gurgling, boiling mud springs. Jets of live</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam shot from these "paint pots" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were wide cracks in the ground from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which black smoke flowed. Pools of clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, here and there, steamed and bub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled as they boiled. Out near the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this old crater, a cone of dark lava stood up</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe a hundred feet high and a plume of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black smoke drifted lazily from its peak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the space inside the bowl was strewn</seg><seg type="columnLine">with huge blocks and lumps of black lava.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim turned and glanced at M'Kada, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked, reckless grin on his face. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief squatted quietly on his heels, gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the fearful spectacle below them, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes unreadable, hard. But there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">THREE LION'S TEETH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fear in those inscrutable black eyes. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">see no place can find fit for them dango</seg><seg type="columnLine">white bv/ana and his Akesi can stop," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "It is fitting that they live on other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, on that high ground. There, not too</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot like here. High. Maybe cool at night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah," Jim said thoughtfully, finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his lion tooth fetish. "Guess you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, Chief. But that bowl is hot as hell. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can feel it from here. Maybe ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wah! Too hot. Maybe can go around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	live for look-see." He was on his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving furtively among the huge blocks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lava, heading to the right along the rim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bowl. He was back in less than five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, perspiration running down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. He shrugged his huge shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Too hot. No man can live for go that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way," he grunted, as he started off to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief was back even ' sooner than</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. He said no word, but shrugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swiped a stream of sweat from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Ford was studying the heights across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bowl, carefully. He could see a column</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lighter colored smoke--wood smoke--</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing up from behind a knife edged low</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge in the early morning air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed it out to Chief M'Kada.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up there's our man, Chief, or I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly fooled," he said. "I'm betting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his camp is under that wood smoke, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind that low, sharp ridge, out of the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the crater. Guess that light colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke would be from his breakfast fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and maybe . . . Look! Look, M'Kada!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down below that light colored smoke, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that big block of black lava. Can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it, M'Kada?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Chief M'Kada scrambled forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared. His eyes flared, he panted with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement. Jim Ford and Chief M'Kada</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gazing spellbound at the huge form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a Negro, robed from chin to heels in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowing, billowing white fabric, that swirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his giant's form in the hot blast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">air from the old crater. He held his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, level with the ground on each side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then swept them to their full height above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. He bowed low, fell to his knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed his forehead to the lava, time after</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Then abruptly, as Jim and the Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared fascinated, a cloud of black smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">belched from a hole in front of the block</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lava where he stood. It hid the ghostly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">form of the priest, and when it drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">away he was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That . . . fire priest!" M'Kada half</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered, his eyes wild. "He will kill--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill--kill on sacrifice block, to please his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire god. Much times I have heard . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">man or woman tied by hands and feet on</seg><seg type="columnLine">big block, longer and wider than a Masai</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior--that fire priest in white cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand over man or woman, with big</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He and Jim leaped to their feet.

He mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned to the right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Ford said nothing; just pointed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the row of small cones, all smoking stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily; like the one in front of them, and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tending for miles in both directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief thumped the ground angrily</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the butt of his spear shaft.

He wheeled suddenly, looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim, held his hand over his mouth in warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.

Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a shrill screech from down there</seg><seg type="columnLine">where M'Kada had disappeared and a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute later the Chief came striding into view,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lugging under his powerful right arm, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Wasuli hunch-back Ng Gamon, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had left at Hapana Simba plantation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest up after; he had reported that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akesi were going to attack Bill White's</seg><seg type="columnLine">plantation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief was laughing loudly. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way of the Negro. Already he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly forgotten his awe at sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white robed priest . . . fear for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety of Helen White. All that had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most been driven from his mind by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">capture of the little hunch-back. Now, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could laugh again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NG GAMON was kicking, scowling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing shrilly in his high pitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. It all looked anything but funny to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. His immense dignity, had been out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> M'Kada dropped the little man in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Jim Ford. "I hear noise like small ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal down there," he said. "I think maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akesi fit for come behind us, make fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I find little spit-cat." He was grinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadly. He had very little respect for Ng</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gamon as a fighting man. And, if a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't fight, then what good was he?</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was M'Kada's philosophy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ng Gamon stared at M'Kada for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, then deliberately ran over and spat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his shadow. The little hunch-back</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, hitched up his gazelle skin "breech</seg><seg type="columnLine">clout and faced Jim Ford. "Me make fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for come here for help you, bwana, quick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after rest make me fit for run trails again,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, with a dignity that was impressive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite his misshapen, undersized body. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood less than five feet in his bare feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Two nights I live for sleep in Baobab</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, like the apes, so lions and leopards no</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat me," he went on. "I fit for come here</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick, like ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> M'Kada's laughter interrupted him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe the mother monkey hold you in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arms like little monkey toto, when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep in Baobab tree," he jeered. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">else you fit for not fall into lion's mouth?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ng Gamon, snarling, scurried around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big Masai and again deliberately spat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his shadow. M'Kada laughed loudly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a playful pass at-Ng Gamon with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">big spear. Had a warrior been so imprud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent as to spit bn the Chief's shadow, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them would have died suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim growled, "Let's hear what Ng Ga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon has to tell us, Chief.

Then, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewise glance of contempt at M'Kada, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "It is fitting that we cross the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire, from here. The Akesi leopard men</seg><seg type="columnLine">live for go that way. They are not Wasuli.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are not even Masai," he sneered, to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chief. "But they live for walk through</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of fire and no get burned up. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">only Wasuli.

The little man suddenly pulled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavy edged, twelve inch dagger from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">scabbard where it was hung on a monkey</seg><seg type="columnLine">fur belt around his waist, and started for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail. "I will lead," he said importantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his high pitched voice. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bragging, aggressive swagger to his mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapen shoulders that brought a roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugher from Chief M'Kada.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Jim Ford arose and at once stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the edge of the bowl, started the steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent close behind Ng Gamon, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as agile as an ape.

"He's got us spotted now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come on. We'll clean this up quick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ng Gamon paused, uncertain. But Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ford immediately pushed by him, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a forty-five automatic in his right hand he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went at a crouching run, following the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain trail made by the many Akesi feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had crossed the land of fire, on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to murder. Chief. M'Kada, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great height, was bent nearly double to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep out of sight of the gunner on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife edged ridge on the opposite side. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had an eager gleam in his black eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was an alertness in his movements</seg><seg type="columnLine">that said much. '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ground was hot, the big blocks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lava on each side of the trail radiated a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady wave of heat. Smoke from open fis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sures in the ground hung in the dead at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere of the bowl like a fog. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stifling, choking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then abruptly, Jim was brought to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt by a circular pool of gently boiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. The trail ended six feet short of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool. Jim looked around uncertainly for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">THREE LION'S TEETH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">8 7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, stood fingering that lion's tooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetish hanging on his shirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ng Gamon scurried forward from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind Chief M'Kada. He stood pointing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ruge block of lava to his left. "Trail fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for go over that way," he said in his high</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched tones. But the little man's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">quavered. It was plain that the threat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle fire had him uneasy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perspiration was running in streams</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all three. The Chief and Ng Gamon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even with the quarter inch layer of callous</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the soles of their feet, lifted one foot at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time, held it up away from the hot, lava</seg><seg type="columnLine">floored trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim growled, "That must have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man doing that shooting. Must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a telescopic sight on his rifle. We'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move fast to get up over that block of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lava and down the other side without get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting shot. I'll bet that devil has the range</seg><seg type="columnLine">to every spot on this trail figured to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnat's eyebrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to Ng Gamon. "Where does</seg><seg type="columnLine">this trail lead, from the top of that block</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lava ?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man was already giddy from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great heat, but he piped up, "Fit for</seg><seg type="columnLine">go across top---jump down on trail again</seg><seg type="columnLine">over there." He was pointing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Follow me, one at a time," Jim or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered. He dropped his automatic into its</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster, got a foothold on the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">block of lava, leaped to the top and raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">across.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rifle slug tore into the lava, then an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other threw fragments into Jim's face be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he could leap down to the trail. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not hit. When Ng Gamon came</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding down off the block backwards, Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled, "That blasted killer can shoot, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. We'll have to look out, now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is so,".the little man muttered faintly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a queer, furtive look in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Being shot at, narrowly missed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who was nearly eight hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, was just about too much for Ng</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gamon. His was not a reckless disposition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT THAT instant, Ng Gamon jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly to one side, just in time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid being crushed by M'Kada as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled down off the block, bellowing loud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. The Chief was rubbing a red streak</seg><seg type="columnLine">along his side, over his ribs, striding</seg><seg type="columnLine">around angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chief! You hit?" Jim asked, stepping</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the big fellow anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. No hit. Burn!" M'Kada yelled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingering a long graze mark where a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">powered slug had passed. "But I fit for</seg><seg type="columnLine">look, while up there." He waved a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand at the top of the block of lava. "I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akesi ..." He held up his hands with</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven fingers showing. "Akesi live for</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, run much fast. They come for try</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill us, for sure. Now! We fight! Kill!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He searched the ground, found out</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the trail led away and stepped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. The heat in the old crater was ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific, almost unendurable now. It was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great oven. Everything--the ground, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks of lava, the air was a quivering mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heat. Perspiration ran down the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of M'Kada's great ebony body in</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams. From time to time he dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat from his eyes. But he was consumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one great desire--to get the Akesi war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors within reach of his big spear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim was close on his heels, an automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped in each hand, the hammers cocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ready. He, too, was bathed in perspira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion; he could hear and feel the sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">squelching in his boots as he moved ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a crouching run. Once, he glanced be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind for Ng Gamon. The little man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowhere in sight. That likeable grin spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Jim's rugged features. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame the little hunch-back too much. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no place for a man of his size</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they met the Akesi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It suddenly occurred to Jim that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopard men knew this hell's playground</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than he and M'Kada did. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">just skirting a deep, clear pool of gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiling water, across a space fifty yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, that was clear of lava blocks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim glanced down into its clear depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. He was startled to see the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete skeleton of a man stretched full</seg><seg type="columnLine">length on the bottom of the pool, maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen feet down. Shreds of a skin breech</seg><seg type="columnLine">clout still clung to the bones, bleached</seg><seg type="columnLine">white by the chemically charged water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some black had evidently tried crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">here without a guide, at night maybe. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight came as a shock to Jim, sobered him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim turned his head, slowed his pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was just opening his mouth to yell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chief that they had better look out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ambush, when seven Akesi warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from behind a big lump of lava and</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came for them, fast, with a high, wild yell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Jim could recover from his sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise and fire, the two warriors in the lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked, hurled their spears. M'Kada neat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly parried the one thrown at him. Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducked low and felt the wind of a spear as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it passed over him, landed in the pool of</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiling water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four of the spear men rushed M'Kada,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at top speed. One came for Jim Ford. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge was lightning fast. It all hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened before he could get set, raise his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistols. Weight of numbers forced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief back. His great spear cut and slashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jabbed furiously, but still, he had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four against one--killer's odds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of the leopard men were wounded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding freely, but they -fought unchecked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were crazed, fanatical with blood lust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In an instant, M'Kada was on the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the pool of boiling water, about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be driven in to a horrible death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Jim Ford's two automatics were</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing. His own attacker was down. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his slugs on Chief M'Kada's en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emies. One went down from the terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock of a steel jacketed forty-five slug.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then another hit the burning hot trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were quick to see that their chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a surprise victory were gone, that only</seg><seg type="columnLine">death waited them here. They broke, started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run for the protection of the great lava</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two who had-thrown their spears</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . and missed . . . swung past the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">block of lava that had been the hiding place</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their ambush. And as the last one ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">by, a small hunch-backed demon with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve inch, wavy edged dagger, flung him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self like a jungle cat from the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">block of lava and landed on the Akesi's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. The demon's long blade was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slashing, cutting, stabbing in a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzy of destruction. In a matter of sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds,' the Akesi warrior was party decapi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated, fell to the hot ground, Ng Gamon</seg><seg type="columnLine">still slashing and stabbing in a good outlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the killer's instinct that his size had, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, kept pent up in his small, misshapen</seg><seg type="columnLine">body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> M'Kada was in hot pursuit of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Akesi warriors who had escaped Jim's</seg><seg type="columnLine">slugs. They both carried wounds from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief's great spear, were weakening fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">from loss of blood. But they were running</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> frantically, dodging, hiding, using their</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior knowledge of the turns and twists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow places among the lava blocks. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief was implacable in his hunt for them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't rest until he had killed both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as Jim started out again on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail to the fire temple alone, the last thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw was the little Wasuli hunch-back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ng Gamon, still crouching over his victim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">methodically plying his dagger. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's long pent up killer instinct, his de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire to be considered a warrior among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of his tribe, was not yet sated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JIM FORD moved carefully, cautiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the knife edged, low ridge on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side of the crater. He couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">help thinking how lucky he and the Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been during the fight, that the rifle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with his telescopic sighted rifle could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see them, in among the giant lava</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks. The Chief especially loomed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the smaller, more agile Akesi. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear for Helen White had grown steadily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since he and the Chief had seen the fanat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical fire priest at his devotions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, Jim was in the shadows of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife edged ridge. He had not exposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself for an instant, in his careful ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance. The lava blocks were lower now. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well up on the side, of the low ridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The air was cooler. Jim had to crawl part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the time, to keep cover. He was think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, "If I can only get into pistol range be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore that 'crazy fire priest sees me. Or that</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man with the rifle, either."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then abruptly, it happened. Jim made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn in the trail, both his guns in their hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters. Fifty feet away, the German tourist</seg><seg type="columnLine">who' had been at the convention at Stanley-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ville hurried toward him, holding a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">powered rifle with a telescopic sight, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">both hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surprise was complete, and disconcert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, for both of them. Kurt Von Stern's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridiculous monocle dropped from his eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim was completely astounded to find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this smooth, suave, seemingly intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent gentleman, was the fiend who was hir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the Akesi killers. Jim snapped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spell of disconcerting surprise first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went for his automatics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Von Stern, cursing luridly in his startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, dove behind a block of lava, sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shot from his rifle at Jim. His bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">went wild.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THREE LION'S TEETH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What have you done with Helen White,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you damned murderer?" Jim yelled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where is she? It'll do you no good to hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. When I blast your guts out, it'll do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you no good to hide her. Where is she?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell with you, swine. I know where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, but you'll never find her . . . alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll never find her," Von Stern yelled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And when my Akesi soldiers have killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of you miserable, ignorant swine--fools</seg><seg type="columnLine">who think you know how to grow coffee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I will be emperor of a big, powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee empire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly Von Stern leaped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from behind the block of lava, fired a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot. In his excitement, he missed again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He jerked the rifle up, snapped the bolt</seg><seg type="columnLine">action lock back and forward, started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn the muzzle on Jim. And at that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant, a steel jacketed forty-five slug hit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock of his rifle, in front of Kurt Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stern's chest, completed shattering it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One quick glance and Von Stern knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung the rifle from him and before Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">could fire again, darted into a lava crevasse</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran like a hare. He was over the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the low ridge and off down a jungle trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond, before Jim Ford, tired from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">long trek of that morning, could overtake</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. But Jim kept doggedly after the man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">following sign persistently. He was cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain now, that Von Stern would lead him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Helen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nine o'clock came and passed and with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out pausing for rest, Jim ate what re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained of the cooked meat and manioc that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he carried in a small knapsack, as a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast-lunch. Sign of the murderer that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he chased was plain. Once he caught a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of him through the jungle as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried desperately on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a strange sound came to Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ford's ears, a sound that he couldn't place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as he approached an open space in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle of growing things, it came to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the squealing and grunting of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was elephant country, all right;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wasn't surprised to hear one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts here. But it sounded as if the ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal were in great pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim moved on more cautiously, studying</seg><seg type="columnLine">every open space in the jungle carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">before moving out into it. He wanted no</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of an angry rogue elephant, suffering</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some injury. In that condition, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">great beasts were more dangerous than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Jim came to the edge of a large,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grassy clear space with just a few small</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees scattered in it. Half way across, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing a game trail, he saw Kurt Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stern staggering along, apparently nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent, too tired to try to break trail through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle, to one side or the other, out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of his pursuer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what caught Jim's eyes with a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete and horrified fascination was a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">bull elephant, rocking from side to side</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the farther edge of the clearing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was grunting, squealing, occasionally blast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a short, agonized scream. A closer look</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that he had only one tusk, the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. The other had been broken off short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe in a fight over some female. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the right tusk stuck out of an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense swelling, was dripping with pus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The animal was literally insane with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man who had lived in Africa at all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who knew anything about them, would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to any lengths to keep out of sight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent of an elephant in the terrible condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that this bull was in. But the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephants that Von Stern had ever seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably, had been in a zoo. He went care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully on toward the safety of the jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">relying on the well known poor sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an elephant, to escape detection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN suddenly everything changed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The great animal had been swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trunk, sampling the air, trying to lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate something--anything alive--that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could vent his insane, unreasoning rage on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his suffering. Abruptly, his trunk be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came rigid, steady. He was drawing great</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling breaths. Then he started to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">--short, uncertain steps at first. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight toward Von Stern. The elephant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps quickened, he was suddenly moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the speed of a locomotive. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of his prey now--had the scent clearfy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kurt Von Stern screamed his panic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to run. The beast gained on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly. The man was doomed. He couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope to reach the jungle ahead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great bull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim emptied his automatic at the beast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He might as well have been firing at a ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton tank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Von Stern dodged, ran desperately foi*</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees.

He followed the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a hound after a rabbit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Von Stern was suddenly over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed. He screamed, just once, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">career of murder was finished, irrevocably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was rapidly being trampled into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth by the great, pounding, crushing, pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver feet of the insane beast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Ford turned away, sickened. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was nothing that he could do, now.

Twenty big Masai warriors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">strung out behind him and a very proud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pompous little Wasuli hunch-back trotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the column. The little man swaggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">extravagantly, raced up to Jim and at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to tell, in his high pitched voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every minute detail of the story of how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had killed an Akesi warrior down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of fire. His tones were loud, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'Kada's warriors would miss no part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his story. Ng Gamon was a warrior, now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had killed his first man, in battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim cut Ng Gamon short to tell M'Kada</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Von Stern and to ask the Chief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where would that fire temple be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">M'Kada ?

And as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did so, twelve Akesi warriors swarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him with shrill war yells, from his left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plainly, they had been spectators at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrificial ceremonies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The priest came out of his prayer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance, ran toward Jim shouting orders to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Akesi warriors, in a deep bellowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">bass, swinging that gleaming big knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim leaped to his right, put his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall, blasted steady fire at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages. A thrown spear gashed the flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his ribs on his left side. He could feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood running down his leg. A thrown dag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger struck him a glancing blow on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, staggering him for a moment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was working his automatics steadily, men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were falling before the steel jacketed slugs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And at that instant Chief M'Kada and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant Masai came around the turn, rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Akesi. Immediately half a dozen dog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fights commenced. Every warrior in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple court yard was screeching his war</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell.

Over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of rain and wind-whipping vines</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could hear the thin babble of Madame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boveese's gramaphone playing an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parisien jazz hit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked with Paulette to Albenese's</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment. No light shone through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed shutters, and they did not try the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Around the'corner there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">single lighted window with the jalousies</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. She hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His room?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded. "Yes.

She rapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">■--waited. There was no answer. She tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. It opened. She stopped suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scream rising in her throat. Starr was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her side with a long stride. He saw Paul</seg><seg type="columnLine">Payen standing against the far wall, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy automatic pistol in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul's eyes were bright and quick. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been smoking, and Starr recognized the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">odor. The tobacco had been liberally spiked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hashish. It took Paul a moment to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize it was his sister in the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Paul!" she went inside. She stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked at an open carryall bag on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. "What are you doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a quick, nervous movement he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust the automatic back in its shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does it look like I'm doing?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he snapped. Her expression of shock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disbelief seemed to exasperate him. "Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you expect me to stay here? in this town?</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are gendarmes here--did you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that? Gendarmes you led here. They let</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get away from them, knowing you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead them to me. And that fellow who</seg><seg type="columnLine">came with you--that American. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably in with them." Paul's eyes sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly focused on Starr, standing just out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the doorway. His hand raced under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his coat . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't go for your gun!" Starr said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striding inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PAUL tried to retreat but the bed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him. He moved aside, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder catching the mosquito net and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tearing it. There was a glimmer of lamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light on metal as the automatic came out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Starr did not try to draw. His left fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled in a sharp hook, connecting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young man's jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul's head snapped; the gun spun from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers. He went down with the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his head banging the floor. He pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to a sitting position, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">baffled and out of focus. His dark hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">strung over his forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paulette seized Starr's arm. He jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Close the door," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did as he commanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paul got to his feet, shaking the fog</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his brain. He looked around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">located the pistol, its flat side reflecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamplight. It was too far away. He wailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his sister,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See? I told you he was--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep still!" growled Starr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Starr glanced in the carryall case. .It</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained clothing, ammunition, a supply;</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tinned food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Going someplace?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's none of your damned business.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to get away from this hell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SORCERER OF KAMBARA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spot in the jungle and don't you--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why do you need to escape?

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the man's shoulder and turned him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was dead, but still loose and disjointed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The back of his coat was turning stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">from blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Starr was still uncertain of the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">identity. He struck a match. The quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame revealed Albenese's sharp-beaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, the pointed eyeballs staring. He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shake out the match, but its chemical</seg><seg type="columnLine">head blazed for what seemed like many</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left Albenese and walked to the bead</seg><seg type="columnLine">drape. The tiny cubbyhole beyond was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">well of darkness.

The beaded drape was swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, making a rattling sound in the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him. He struck a match. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while before the mantle took hold, fill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the room with pure, white light. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went from window to window, closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jalousies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Albenese's clothes hung on a rod along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the closet. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back was the large chest of tacula wood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oiled and rubbed to bring out its blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">red color. As Paul said, it was padlocked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lock was a heavy one of American</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacture. He drew his pistol, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered. He went to where Albenese</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lying and hunted through his pockets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No key. He found a short, bronze bar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">once part of some hand-operated punkahs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a foot in length and thick as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb. He fitted it in the lock staple and</seg><seg type="columnLine">levered it out, the dry wood giving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp, ripping crash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chest contained a couple of old-</seg><seg type="columnLine">style tommy-guns with pie-plate maga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zines, a quantity of dynamite with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitro drained out leaving its oily dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coloration on the bottom of the chest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a canvas money sack bearing the imprint</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SORCERER OF KAMBARA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Banque Commerciale dtt Congo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He opened the sack and found an assort-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment of slum-quality gold and silver</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jewelry, a watch, a crude ivory crucifix.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He backed, rising and whirling around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There had been no sound--only the trem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ble of the termite-eaten floor. The front</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">door was still closed. He sensed a move-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment to his right. Viga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The huge, Saharah tribesman had let</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">himself in silently by the rear door. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was crouched forward, arms hanging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">loose, a Luger pistol clutched in his right</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lhand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the moment he did not seem to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">notice Starr.

The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gun was half drawn when Viga, moving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with unexpected quickness, swept up a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chair and flung it, waist high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It struck Starr, hammering the gun</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from his hand. He had no time to re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trieve it. He dived, clutching Viga's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wrist, forcing the Luger pistol high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They reeled against the wall. Starr</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knew he was no match for the native in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a test of strength. He let the hand go,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">took a quick back step, and pumped a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right to the jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Viga absorbed the blow with no change</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in his small, brute eyes. The Luger was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still above his head. He did not try to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aim it. He swung it down, driving its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">barrel to the left side of Starr's neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Starr clutched the barrel with both</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands and bent forward, almost twisting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it from Viga's grasp. The movement was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unexpected. Viga struggled for the gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His heel caught in loose matting and he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">staggered back. The calves of his legs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">struck the bed, the mosquito net was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stretched tightly across his shoulders sav-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing him from falling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He let go the gun barrel, reached</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">high seizing the net and tearing it from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its pull-cord.
