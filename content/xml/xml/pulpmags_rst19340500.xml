            <seg type="columnLine">1885, on the Southeastern Ry. (now part of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">railroad company needed a large quantity of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">granite, so they acquired right to a quarry at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">top of St. Pie mountain.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">spur was built to the foot of the mountain and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then a railroad was put up the side of the moun-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tain with an even grade to the quarry at the top.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The motive power was created by the loaded car</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">descending. This pulled up the empty car by a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">steel cable which wound several times around two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">steel drums at the top of the line. These drums</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Thereupon my father figured out how to make</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">would force the weighted lever over and the</seg>
