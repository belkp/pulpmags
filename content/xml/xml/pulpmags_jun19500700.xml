Small whirlpools and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strings of dancing bubbles told of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verging pressures beneath the surface as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river was forced in upon itself. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready the canoe was beginning to strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leap as though imbued with a life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GORGE was closing in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarming speed.

Could they</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly put the canoe through that swirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing corridor without capsizing or smashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to bits against the granite?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor twisted for a last look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy craft, wondering whether they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would carry their strangely furious pursuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he turned back, he cried to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">three companions, "The dangos are fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing us in, so it can't be too dangerous!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hold to the center and we'll make it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor deliberately told the merest half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth. The only thing proved by the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft following them was that the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond this narrow point wasn't impass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. As for going through the perilous</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor itself, what would be safe for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy war canoes, steadied by many</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddles, would be a veritable hell for four</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhausted people in a frail, skittering shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a boat such as theirs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the worst fact of all was that even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">if by some miracle they did get through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the large craft would gain tremendously</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the swift-running current. And Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely failed to mention that now braced</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the skull-tipped prow of the lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing war canoe was a warrior with a drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lead canoe had pushed within arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">range. Since a single hit in those roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters might well throw the small craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of control, the picked bowman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted no time in scrambling up for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">try.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because of his position in the stern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor's own broad back would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior's target. Therefore, he kept his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge to himself, seeing no sense in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this crucial moment of further upsetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene and the two chieftains. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed to keep all their attention on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage, and distracting them with worry</seg><seg type="columnLine">about whether he might be hit wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">help to block off the arrows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then with a sudden wild spurt, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe drove into the dangerous area. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucked and leaped like a frenzied horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddering under the river's blows, seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to fight deliberately to spin out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">control and shatter itself against the cliffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the rising tumult of the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded the exultant cries of the pursuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks. As they saw the crazy skittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the small boat, they were confident</seg><seg type="columnLine">their long chase was nearly over. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own great canoes were knifing straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the center of the gorge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An arrow, barely seen so swift was its</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight, dug the roiling surface beside Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's paddle.

But in the noise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion of that hurtling ride, when their</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole beings were concentrated on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate task of controlling the boat, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord's companions didn't notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">either arrow. And to all outward appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances he was no more awrare of his danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than were they.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His paddle didn't hesitate in its furious</seg><seg type="columnLine">labors. He held his same position unflinch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, aware that his own broad body</seg><seg type="columnLine">shielded Helene. His strong, clear voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he shouted instructions and encourage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was devoid even of excitement, let</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The walls swirled past. A dozen times</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster threatened and was turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">8	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by the swift, coordinated action of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle couple and the two chieftains. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">death reaching from every side, a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength flared up in them like that last</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright burst of flame from dying embers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Years of trekking together had trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to act with a single mind in emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gencies, so that they strove together</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the river in perfect unison. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this skilled teamwork plus raw courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">which kept them afloat, brought them</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling into the narrowest part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE spray-splashed walls reached in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward for them. Uncounted tons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock seemed deliberately pressing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to close off that foaming lane of water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An arrow broke against the granite beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor. Another streaked blood across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle-sw'ollen left shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The seeking arrows nosed closer with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every shot. The next, or the next, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find its mark. He'd been lucky to last</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as he had. Realizing this, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced inwardly for the tearing shock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a death-barb hammering into his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly, unexpectedly, the can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon flared wide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a length, of a hundred yards on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side, the base of the cliffs had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut away. Untold centuries of water gnaw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at soft strata of rock had carved out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broad, circular chamber. But, as Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor swiftly saw, the hands of men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done much to augment nature's work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment the canoe drove into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open space a wild, despairing curse ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from N'Geeso's lips. "Aaaiiiee! Trapped!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shrilled. "They've herded us to the kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">like sheep!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And though Ki-Gor made no outcry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same black despair burst over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Along the cliffs on either side ran broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone walks two feet above the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The walks swarmed with armed warriors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Worse yet, a long, sleek war canoe lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected from the current behind a stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakwater immediately to their right. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat was fullv-manned, the warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">poised to send the craft flashing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The White Lord saw these obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangers in a single fleeting glance, sensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace, too, in the queer derrick-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">structures built of massive timbers at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ends of the walks. These huge contrap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions had heavy stone weights suspended</seg><seg type="columnLine">out over the water from their topmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams. Around the derricks crews of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men busied themselves with cables as large</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a warrior's arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shocked Masai and Pygmy Chief-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains faltered in their stroke.

It was not in him, though, ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give up, to wait like a fettered chicken</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the death-blow to fall. By all the gods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least they could make the task of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">butchers more difficult by giving them a</seg><seg type="columnLine">running, twisting target.

Five--ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty yards they drove, tearing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart9 out.

Ki-Gor said, low-voiced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then his grey eyes struck hard against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three big blacks standing nearest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pygmy reached up, and with the matchless</seg><seg type="columnLine">effrontery of his kind, caught hold of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest warrior and swung himself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tembu George was the last to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bottom of the canoe, he lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two great shovel-bladed Masai spears</seg><seg type="columnLine">used by Ki-Gor and him and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighter spears carried by N'Geeso and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holding the weapons carelessly in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge-thewed arm, the giant Masai finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped onto the stone walk, casually</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced over muscular warriors who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfed by his presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime, without appearing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do so, Ki-Gor's eye had searched out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader of the warriors. He stood beside a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door-sized tunnel leading into the cliff. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">differed from his men in both looks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a tall, well-set-up man, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">finely modeled features, straight hair, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-brown rather than black complexion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of the usual native war gear, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore a plumed silver helmet and a beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tifully wrought silver breastplate, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with a short, flat sword and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">javelin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where the warriors were barefoot, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet -were protected by stout sandals, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shins by gleaming metal guards. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangest part of his apparel to Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the skirt-like leather garment, joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">strips of studded rhino hide, with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he armored his middle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LEADER studied them with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar intentness, frowning slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, apparently undecided as to what move</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should make. This slowness in acting</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouraged Ki-Gor. For the man's benefit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the White Lord turned toward the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked canoes, laughed grimly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">predicament of the survivors. At the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, he was listening to the murmured</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk of the warriors, noting they spoke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bantu tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the comer of his eye, the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">man saw the leader stroke his chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully for several seconds, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">start forward slowly, as though still rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtful about what he was going to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor let him get almost to him, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he registered any consciousness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's presence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAST-GODS OF ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Ki-Gor turned, and seeming1 to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the armored man for the first time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke out in a wide smile. He pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningfully toward the blacks struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the water, and laughing loudly, strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet the oddly garbed warrior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our thanks to you, Brother," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartily. "The scavangers had us finished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">run to earth.

"You'll not find us un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grateful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Who are you, stranger?" the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked wonderingly, "to know this place</seg><seg type="columnLine">and l&gt;e so certain of our protection?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am called Ki-Gor," the White Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied, "and this is my wife, Helene."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though in all the jungle there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">better known name than the White Lord's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warrior's face showed not a flicker of</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are--are there- many others like you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside?" he asked.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shrugged. "Oh, well, what's the differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence.

Ancient writings referred</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter-of-factly to its existence, explain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing how a cataclysmic upheaval of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth had destroyed the continent. But all</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts to substantiate the legends by</seg><seg type="columnLine">locating the sunken cities or connecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country's culture with that of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient, but later, peoples, had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. In recent years, scholars had</seg><seg type="columnLine">termed the whole Atlantis idea a myth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying firmly that since it couldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved, it could never have been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's wrong?" asked Ki-Gor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a hurried whisper, she told him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legend.

The canoe had come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the breakwater and was moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly along the barrier passing lines to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the half-drowned natives clinging to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spikes. Although most of the men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly gashed and battered, with several</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipping from view while Ki-Gor watched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boatmen went about their task at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leisurely pace, obviously not caring whe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther the wreck victims lived or died. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">callous attitude spoke of a deep-seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatred born of long and bitter warfare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the last line had been distributed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrier dropped out of sight and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe turned toward shore, dragging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">survivors through the water behind it. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter how badly some were hurt, none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the painted warriors were taken into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the craft swung close to the bank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moaning, threshing blacks were jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly from the water, thrust into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblance of a line. Many of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in no condition to stand, but whenever</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the gagging, bleeding men col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsed, he was kicked and heaved to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coldly curious about these wrarriors who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stalked him so relentlessly, Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched bleakly as they were hauled onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank. But his mouth tightened, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to clench and unclench his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist, as he witnessed their harsh mistreat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, saw their wounds go unattended. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was a grimmer or more merciless</seg><seg type="columnLine">foe in battle than the White Lord, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">once an enemy surrendered, he accorded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him good treatment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anger gathered hotly in his eyes.

As the seconds drained away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain didn't reappear, his patience</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, without considering the con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sequences, he strode forward, pushed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the guards and the prisoners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What manner of warriors are you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said coldly.

Nepah said, his glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">slashing questioningly at the men about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I don't understand," the Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "These scum tried to kill you! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you care what happens to them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Their fangs are drawn now," snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor, "so it is stupid to mistreat them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll never fight against you again, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">bind up their wounds. The side that tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphs can afford to be generous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nepah stroked his chin, his forehead</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinkling beneath the burnished silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet. For the first time, he looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoners as though they were actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings. Abruptly, he shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it pleases you, why not," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor, and he ordered proper care given</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's more than a matter of pleasing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend," Ki-Gor said seriously. "It's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of doing the right, the decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain smiled comically. "Ah, yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but who is to say I do a good thing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">prolonging their lives? It is question I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will ask of you later--when you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived a time in the Second Empire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though easily spoken, there was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAST-GODS OF ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ominous hint in his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come! Our boat waits," he invited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor turned expectantly toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. The canoe which had rescued the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners, once more was behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakwater on the far side of the gorge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No other craft was in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. This way," Nepah said, starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor hid his surprise, waved to Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the two chieftains to follow him. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, when he saw the relief flooding into</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces, did he realize fully how great</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance he had taken for a few-hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages who meant less than nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He grinned guiltily at Tembu George</seg><seg type="columnLine">and N'Geeso and picking the easiest path</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the tunnel, started along the line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Near the end of the line, shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed, legs widespread with the effort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing, was a battered native with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly gash across his chest and bloody</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears 011 both thighs, from the spiked</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not forget this, White One," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasped hoarsely when Ki-Gor came</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast of him. "Mercy for my men is</seg><seg type="columnLine">something I never expected from one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devil's breed. You have my thanks--</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with my undying hatred V9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor slowed, looked at him closely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it dawned on him. This was the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had tried to kill him with the bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arrow, the raging demon who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced himself in the bow of the leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">war canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No matter what tortures are pUv upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," went on the prisoner, speaking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor's ears alone, "I swear I will live</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough to one day return your favor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then--then I will be free to kill you for</seg><seg type="columnLine">luring me into this trap." He was panting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for breath, his red-rimmed eyes almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazed with emotion. "That is the promise</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Molaki, White One! Remember it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No flicker of emotion crossed Ki-Gor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">-features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a fool, One-Called-Molaki," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said quietly. "A very great fool."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHITE LORD walked on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel, sternly repressing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry words which seethed within him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing was to be gained in talking fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther with the fanatical black. Though a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized man would have scoffed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native's promise as the meaningless bab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blings of a hurt, dazed man, Ki-Gor knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molaki meant exactly what he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In intervening successfully for his men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black felt that Ki-Gor had put him in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">debt. Molaki, as their leader, was responsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble for his warriors, and if at a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he was unable to help them, another</seg><seg type="columnLine">person assumed that responsibility, then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must personally see that the favor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">repaid in full. The fact that he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor had deliberately led him into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap made it even more pressing to repay</seg><seg type="columnLine">the favor, for it was bitter medicine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept charity from a hated enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene caught up with Ki-Gor as lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the tunnel. The dim walkway was</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely wide enough for them to proceed</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by side, and its ceiling was so low</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle man had to stoop to keep from</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraping his head. The corridor bored</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight into the rock, with the only illum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ination being the weak, yellow glow every</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten yards of small charcoal-filled braziers</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in the walls. Nepah walked briskly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few steps past the fifth brazier the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel opened into a high vaulted cavern.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the light of torches held by natives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor could see that the cavern was fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred yards wide, and down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of it, like a precisely cut canal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone the black waters of a stream. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no way to estimate the length of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground chamber, for it disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">into velvet darkness on either side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A canoe manned by ten paddlers waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the water. Drawn up on the bank near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by were seven empty craft. "The three</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us will go with them," the warrior</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain declared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three?" said Ki-Gor. "You're mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken. There are five of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nepah turned slowly. "There's no rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">about your servants," he said. "I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">them brought along later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor spoke with sharp emphasis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"These men are a very long way from</seg><seg type="columnLine">being servants. They are my friends, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two greatest chieftains of the jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George of the Masai and N'Geeso</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Pygmies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fleeting expression of surprise passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Nepah's face and was hidden. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">14	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined his head slightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I meant no discourtesy," he apologized</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. "It is just that our customs . . ."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought better of what he had meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say and let the sentence trail away. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be difficult with the Empress Teeva,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but perhaps it can be managed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Masai and Pygmies could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful allies for Atlantis," Ki-Gor said</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointedly, "--or very dangerous enemies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You understand, of course, both tribes</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that their leaders accompanied me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nepah's lips twisted in a cynical smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you must understand, O Ki-Gor,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said evenly, "that the decisions of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Empress are quite beyond me. I am a</seg><seg type="columnLine">humble soldier. I do what I am told with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out regard for allies or enemies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BRISKLY THEN, he ordered two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paddlers out of the canoe to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make room for the chieftains. He helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene into the craft, stood aside while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor and his friends stepped in. Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was increasingly puzzled by the warrior,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or perhaps "intrigued" was more the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was impossible to gauge the man. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">one moment he seemed naive, almost ignor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant, and the next, sardonically wise. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his statements, the White Lord felt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried two meanings, one which you un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood, and another, subtler one, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">only he understood. He was a soldier, yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but an unusual one, and quite lacking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the humbleness he professed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nepah was preparing to follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others into the boat, when his glance fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the empty canoes. He stopped abruptly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun to confront the nearest torchbearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One craft is gone!" he cried accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly. "I ordered that no person was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The torch trembled in the native's hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whites of his eyes showed, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsing beat of fear shook his belly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was the priest, Sire," explained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black shakily. "I told him your orders, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pushed me aside and had his men</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch the canoe." His voice almost failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and for a second all he could utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an incoherent clucking noise. "I--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't kill a priest, Sire! I couldn't do</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. And he sped off before there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to call you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain stood rigidly, his fists</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched, his face dark with anger. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed priest!" he snarled. "I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known better. I forgot he had his crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">to row him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he snatched the torch from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, whirled with catlike speed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">springing into the canoe, roared to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oarsmen to pull their backs out or he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have them flayed alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The canoe leaped ahead at his order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knifing away from the landing down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark channel of water. Affixed to a metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">holder on the prow of the boat was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch which strove ineffectually to light</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way for the oarsmen. But the straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">men seemed to know every inch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream so well that illumination was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">important.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noting- the dark scowl which persisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Nepah's features, Ki-Gor asked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">why the priest's departure had upset him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The jungle man sensed that he and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions were somehow involved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wanted to get you and the red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired woman to the Empress," gritted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nepah, "before Sha-Topat even suspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">your presence. Your coming will deal a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow to the prestige of the whole priest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head worriedly, leaned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare ahead into the cavern's darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, though, there's no knowing what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to expect. He's as dangerous as a cobra,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a thousand times more cunning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why should our presence harm</seg><seg type="columnLine">him ?" Ki-Gor wanted to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warrior captain smiled thinly, mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice gleaming in his eyes. "Because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priesthood has kept us locked within our</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronghold, rotting away to weakness year</seg><seg type="columnLine">by year, by preaching that no help lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the outside for us. We were the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">segment of the white race alive, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore. Outside only endless hordes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black barbarians existed. By your very</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence, you prove Sha-Topat isn't di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinely infallible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely, some of you go out," declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor. "Those painted devils who chased</seg><seg type="columnLine">us wouldn't be patrolling the river if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't on the lookout for your war</seg><seg type="columnLine">parties." Molaki's angry speech had shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he mistook the White Lord for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizen of Atlantis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAST-GODS OF ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain nodded agreement. "Parties</seg><seg type="columnLine">go out, all right--but only Sha-Topat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">men." Bitter irony edged his voice. "Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Anointed of Raa can be safely exposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the evils beyond our gates. Conveniently</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, they are the only ones who</seg><seg type="columnLine">can loot enemy villages and capture</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KI-GOR flexed his fingers, regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">them studiously. The talk of ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">empires was beyond him, but he under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood thoroughly the struggle of ruthless</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaders for power over people. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no desire to become a pawn in the battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the unseen religious and temporal</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads of Atlantis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For an humble soldier, who thinks no</seg><seg type="columnLine">further than his immediate duty," Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">said lightly, "you seem unusually, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">personally, concerned in the affairs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your superiors/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The soft-spoken gibe went home.

"After all, bringing you to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Empress is quite a feather in my cap." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">added meaningfully, "When you've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">on guard in that damp, sunless gorge as</seg><seg type="columnLine">many moons as I have, you remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">longingly how easy life was in the palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Nepah's protestations didn't ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">true to the White Lord. There was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than personal ambition mixed in his desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to outwit Sha-Topat. Though possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sardonic handsomeness and a court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ier's smooth tongue, Nepah was no soft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed palace dandy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene turned and smiled at the captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You belittle yourself," she chided, show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing she had been following their talk. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunately true that the best warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw the most dangerous and unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties.

It was a roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">deathtrap until those two canoes piled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then it got as quiet as a pond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nepah's eyes roved the darkness. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">called for more speed from the oarsmen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despite his calm flow of conversation, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was apparent that inwardly he grew more</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious by the minute when they didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring the priest's boat into view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a simple, but very clever trick</seg><seg type="columnLine">devised by the Second Empire's builders,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "Just above the narrow portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gorge, they cut a tunnel from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern through to the river, coming in well</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the surface so no opening would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be visible. By the use of flood gates, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can divert as much or as little water from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gorge as we like, thus making the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">run rough or calm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor was impressed, and compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented the method by which the river was</seg><seg type="columnLine">used as a powerful defense weapon. Ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously, the builders of the Second Empire</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed a high order of intelligence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why do we travel this cavern?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Helene. "Surely, your people don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">live underground."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, not quite underground," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nepah, with a trace of laughter, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stream is the one and only way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach Atlantis. You'll understand in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. We're almost there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed to a rapidly growing circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light ahead of them. Helene and Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor leaned forward, tensely awaiting their</seg><seg type="columnLine">initial glimpse of Atlantis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the canoe, all was quiet except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hard breathing of the oarsmen and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle splash of paddles digging the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">in unison. Daylight reached through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness toward them, faintly outlining</seg><seg type="columnLine">in grey, the wet rock of the cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then with the suddenness of a tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm, the attack broke over them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their first intimation of trouble was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy crash of a grappling hook against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prow of the craft.

Then came the pain-crazed shriek</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an oarsman impaled in the back by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second hook. Sitting in the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, the man was jerked upright and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled overboard with a wild flailing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The craft rocked dangerously. Panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasted among the oarsmen. Showering</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the grey murk came more of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grappling irons.

He rode the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaving sway of the boat on braced legs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his long knife making a glittering sweep as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he whipped it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His great voice beat through the uproar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the faithful Tembu George and</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso.

His fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed her cheek, her hair, in brief ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then with lightning speed, he whirled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched the torch from Nepah's grasp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like a great cat he sprang out across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowing strip of water separating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe from the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he landed on the shore, the at-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORJES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tackers were almost on him.

Like a felled tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man toppled aside, cut nearly apart in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the gouting rush of the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood stained his black robe, Ki-Gor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">past him. His blade clanged against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">short sword of his second victim, knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in a gleaming arc. With a short, quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">slash, he laid open the man's throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he spun to the left, sweeping his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy knife down on a thin man's hooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. He jerked it free, and laying a wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steel about him to send the last two</seg><seg type="columnLine">attackers leaping out of his path, he broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">free of the group.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By his swift and deadly charge, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst through the whole line of robed</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.

The jungle man had counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on causing enough disruption to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George and N'Geeso time to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore, but it seemed odd to him that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy should let him draw them off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater target of the boat so easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another thing that puzzled him was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter silence in which the attackers fought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was none of the shouting, cursing</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedlam which accompanied most hand-to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand fighting in the jungle. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no orders given, and even those men he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck down, died with nothing more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">gurgling grunts of pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Acting deliberately to rivet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">more attention on himself, Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw back his head, made the cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverberate with the chilling Masai war</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute, animal vigor of the man was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsing, crackling force that struck one</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an electric shock.

Though normally he was a quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant, almost shy, person, in combat</seg><seg type="columnLine">he .became a raging machine of destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, his whole character and look altering</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely. He was far above most men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in strength and speed, and he had a lion's</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage, a leopard's cunning. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he liked fighting, for he labored</seg><seg type="columnLine">endlessly to end tribal warfare and bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace to the jungle. But he seemed en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dowed by nature to be a warrior, fated</seg><seg type="columnLine">always to be cast into situations where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must exert his battle prowess. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew by instinct more tricks of combat</seg><seg type="columnLine">than most men would learn in a life-time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in addition he had amassed bitterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">won experience from countless deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle struggles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now by his swift, daring action, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">willingness to draw the full fury of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy attack on himself, he saved Nepah's</seg><seg type="columnLine">men from massacre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the bulk of the enemy turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the river to rush him, Tembu George</seg><seg type="columnLine">and N'Geeso entered the fray.

The robed killers hacking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fear-stricken oarsmen were the Masai</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pygmy leaders' first targets. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck in among them, thrusting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbing with terrible accuracy, knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">without an order from Ki-Gor that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">first job must be to insure Helene's safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a thrice, they had swept the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, scattering all the surprised attackers</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for four grotesquely flopping forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">3--Jungle--Summer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">who would never again be a danger to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with their blood lust whetted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">those initial four victims, Tembu George</seg><seg type="columnLine">and N'Geeso sped in behind the men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rushing the White Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unlike Ki-Gor, these two fierce black</seg><seg type="columnLine">men revelled in battle, taking savage joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dispatching of a foe. For centuries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">war had been the wine of life, the ultimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">goal of every male's training for both</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tribes. The proud Masai and Pyg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies had been the greatest troublemakers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Congo before they came under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord's influence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CHIEFTAINS went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle man's aid in the nick of time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For despite his skill and agility, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard put to keep from being borne under</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the swarming attackers. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanatical desperation in the way the raiders</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled themselves in upon him. Only by</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting, turning, and rapidly giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, while his blade wove a glittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield about him, did he manage to beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">them off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a brilliant display of swordsman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, but the man didn't live who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">long sustain such exertions, and Ki-Gor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength already had been drained by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruelling canoe race down the gorge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Ho!

A robed figure, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of a sword slash at Ki-Gor, whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">off-balance drunkenly and fell, legs liter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally cut from under him by the pygmv.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then as they bounded forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intent on hacking a path through to Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor, suddenly Nepah was fighting beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.

He threw himself boldly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy, more than matching the chieftain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried advance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nepah was the first to reach the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord's side. "Back to the boat,55 he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted. "There may be more of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil's servants on the way." He blocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enemy's thrust expertly with his short</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword.

Instead of cower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sheep for victims, the attackers found</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had stirred up maddened lions. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of killing, they were being killed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tembu George's spear flicked out, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man staggered back with his shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid open.

Green moss, lichens and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly tangled vines clung to the crater</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, a wild, brilliantly colored tapestry</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which Ki-Gor could spy the flitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of monkeys and bright-plumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungl e-birds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Except for a single, broad, level island</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its center, the floor of the crater was</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered by the lake. Along the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore of the island lay a walled city, grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ancient and brooding. The massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone walls came down to the very edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the water, and above and beyond them</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen rooftops, towers and temples</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely out-of-place on this hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Congo island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Broad, cultivated fields were visible on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side of the city, but the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island, fully four-lifths of it, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild tangle of jungle, seemingly no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched by the hand of man than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord's own forest retreat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KI-GOR SAT SILENTLY, his prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing eyes missing no detail of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene as they drew near the island.

The walls on closer in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spection were sagging and broken, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weathered towers in many cases in dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous disrepair. Far from improving on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work of their fathers, the people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis weren't even able to maintain</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had been left them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though right beside them, the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">20	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was a riot of luxuriant growth, the fields</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the city bore sparse, scraggiy crops.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surprisingly few boats were in evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the bank. And on the walls, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields and along the waterfront, not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single white-skinned person was in evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence, only slow-moving, lackadasical</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing Ki-Gor saw spoke well of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Second Empire's rulers. In fact, the use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word "empire" was a pathetic farce</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the practical jungle man. But Helene,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting beside him, saw the city in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely different and far less critical light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her view was colored by the romance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drama of the place, for she saw it through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veil of history, was awed by the knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge that she was penetrating a secret kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">for centuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tembu George's feelings about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Second Empire were far less complicated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He regarded it from a strictly military</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewpoint. "Using a handful of men, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could fight off forever a hundred armies,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'Geeso heard him and turned with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of mock amazement.

You admitted it without</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinking an eye."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tembu George squinted at the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the crater. "I admitted nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the Masai," he said contentedly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke only of ordinary, run-of-the-jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors--" he paused to flick an imagin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary gnat from his arm--"men like your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, if I must be plain." He smiled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">winked at the White Lord. Then the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosed up to a small stone dock and Nepah</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried them ashore. Obviously, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't being taken to the city's main</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing. A narrow door was set into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Nepah hammered it with the hilt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sword.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though the entrance looked unused, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor noted that the door 0|&gt;ened swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without a single protesting squeak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nepah pushed past a black guard, led the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way down a musty, yard-wide corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a low, torchlit room where sat four</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">more guards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men came hastily to their feet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment Nepah entered, seemingly sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised to see him. Ki-Gor had served with</seg><seg type="columnLine">too many wrarriors not to recognize the</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect of the natives for the captain. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than mere deference to rank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See that my crewmen are cared for,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered Nepah. "Get them out of sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one is to talk with them or even know</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they are for the time being." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbed a finger at two of the men. "Light</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way to the Red Palace. I want to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Following the captain and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the torchbearers, Ki-Gor and Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">went through a door down two flights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dank stairs and into a chill, wet tunnel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For long minutes, they hurried through</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting passages, slowing only to skirt piles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of debris where the sides or roof had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given way. Whatever the original purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the network of tunnels beneath Atlantis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was obvious they had long been aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor was troubled by the excessive</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrecy with which Nepah was bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them into the city. It boded no good for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their future well-being. He felt more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more that Nepah regarded them as im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant pawns to be used in a struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the Empress and Sha-Topat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it occurred further to Ki-Gor thal</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were placing a great deal of trust in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain. He could be a scoundrel for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all they knew, despite his brave words</seg><seg type="columnLine">about devotion to country. He could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">using them in a private intrigue of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own. There was bound to be something</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously wrong when a servant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Empress, instead of approaching his ruler</seg><seg type="columnLine">openly in her own capital, chose a furtive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">backdoor route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though Tembu George and N'Geeso</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared utterly unperturbed, soon after</seg><seg type="columnLine">they entered the tunnel Ki-Gor realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they shared his doubts. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought their spears into the passage, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for men who were always so careful with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their weapons, they seemed to Ki-Gor sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly to become unbelievably careless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">awkward. Time after time they let their</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear-points grate against the walls, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at every turn into a new passage they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly clumsy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAST'GODS OF ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If they even heards the sounds, Nepah</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Guards paid no attention. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">after wincing several times at the rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatment of valuable weapons, the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord looked questioningly back at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends. He saw N'Geeso, holding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear firmly about two feet back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, deliberately gash the soft, damp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotted stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he realized what the chieftains</seg><seg type="columnLine">were doing. By acting as if they were hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing trouble with their spears in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cramped underground corridors, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gouging white slashes out of the moss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered stone to mark their route. Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's eyes sharpened appreciatively. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">too trusting of strangers, the chieftains</seg><seg type="columnLine">were leaving open a way of retreat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guides finally brought them into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage which slanted upward for a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred yards and came to a dead end. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may go back now," Nepah said, dismissing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blacks. Without a word, they turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurried away down the ramp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the torch-carrying natives disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, utter darkness closed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocked tunnel. Tembu George and N'Geeso</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved in beside the jungle couple, fearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trap. Nepah never knew how close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death he came in that moment when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to explain what he was about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor was poised to spring, his sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">already half-drawn, when there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint creak and a widening line of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tunnel's dead-end revealed Nepah</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoving open a small door. Apparently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had waited until the guides were gone so</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one could learn the trick by which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he opened a door through seemingly solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As wary as a leopard, Ki-Gor followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain through the opening, shielded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene behind him. They were in a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, bare except for two dusty racks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor and weapons. From the little-used</seg><seg type="columnLine">armory, Nepah led them into a hall, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">two high, narrow flights of stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four powerful black warriors stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard before an ornate door. They stif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fened to attention when they saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain.. Lounging in a nearby window was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first white man beside Nepah, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen in Atlantis. He wore the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leather armor, but he was a small, lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guid man, with little of the look of a war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rior about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What have we here that excites you</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, Nepah?" he asked nasally. His glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran over the group as he took his time</seg><seg type="columnLine">about getting up. "You take quite a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving your border post to visit us. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything should go wrong, I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to be in your place." He screwed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thin face disapprovingly. "What's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story back of these people? They look as</seg><seg type="columnLine">white as we do." There was a malicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">insolence about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nepah flushed red with anger. "An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounce me, Tal, you stupid, self-important</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool! Think you that I came here to prattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you ?" He moved threateningly to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the man. "Quick now, before I take</seg><seg type="columnLine">your worthless duties on myself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Startled by Nepah's outburst, the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed nervously toward the door, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth twisting. He apparently had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected the captain meekly to submit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his insulting posturing and prying, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he didn't, Tal's air of superiority</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But with his hand on the door, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered enough assurance to snarl, "Still</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to be the old, arrogant Nepah, eh?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe after a few more moons in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge you'll realize you're finished. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends at court, not more enemies, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you should be trying desperately to make."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he slid through the door and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Nepah glowered, stung by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Tal's parting shot. "Lice!" he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">by way of explanation to Ki-Gor. "Human</seg><seg type="columnLine">lice! I'll see them all cleaned out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace one day." His jaw was firmly set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black guards hadn't shifted a mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cle during the entire exchange, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord noted an approving glitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tal came out of the room. "I told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Empress you had left your post," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">venomously, "and were outside with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors asking to see her." His pale lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">curled triumphantly. "She said for you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come in--only you! She seemed rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sure you presented my case quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">well," said Nepah sarcastically.

Don't kill me!" pleaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gasping, fear-palsied officer. "Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">back," he screamed at the blacks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guards slowed, stopped. It was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their minds to try swift javelin throws.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The weapons balanced in upraised hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they tensely eyed the jungle man, gauging</seg><seg type="columnLine">their chances of felling him before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could swing Tal against the stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor read their intentions. As they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidled apart, trying to divide his attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pin him in a corner, he clasped Tal</seg><seg type="columnLine">protectively in front of him with his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, snatched the man's sword free with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right.

Her hair was like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight, her skin a luminous white. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the arched line of her brows, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">large eyes were changeful pools of dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, as though strange black tongues of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame curled and twisted in their depths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She wore a sheer robe of purest white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound close about her slim waist by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow circlet of gold. The very simplicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her dress served to accentuate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking beauty of her lithe, curved body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was of medium height, but her air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of certain and absolute authority made</seg><seg type="columnLine">her appear taller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tal gave a convulsive gasp.

Helene</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the chieftains gathered about Teeva,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening warily as she related how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests originally had gotten the populace</seg><seg type="columnLine">under their thumb following the First</seg><seg type="columnLine">Empire's destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They saw' their opportunity and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most of it," she continued. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">drummed home the idea that Raa de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed Atlantis because the people had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned their faces from him, refusing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">heed and properly honor the priests who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were his earthly representatives."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the priests, she said, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealed the Second Empire off from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, making it a crime punishable by</seg><seg type="columnLine">death for anyone outside their order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture out of the hidden stronghold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps in the beginning they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sincere in trying to protect Atlantis from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black barbarians and give it time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">regather its strength," she stated frankly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But that was long, long ago.

There was a question in Ki-Gor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and he looked at Helene. If condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions were as bad as Teeva painted them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't he be doing wrong not to aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in unseating the priestcraft? From a</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal angle, he already had a score to</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle with Sha-Topat. The high priest had</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared war on the jungle man before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">set foot in the city and it wasn't in Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's nature ever to forgive a cowardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHITE LORD at that moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">became conscious of Nepah's intent</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny. He looked up to find that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer had come quietly up beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Empress as she talked. And the look he</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised on Nepah's face was strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense and strained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the time, the jungle man put down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officer's expression to feelings against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the priestcraft aroused by Teeva's story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But later he was to recall that look and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put a different interpretation on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If my wife and I are such a threat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the priests," Ki-Gor pointed out guard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly, "I hardly think they will greet us</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long lost cousins. Why should they</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept nothing- more than a white skin as</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof that the blood of Atlantis flows in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our veins? Would you do it, if it meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">your ruin ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Teeva frowned. "Sha-Topat and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack have no choice," she stated. "Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the children of Raa are white.

His own idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had once consisted of no more than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle where he grew to boyhood. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked helplessly at Helene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before he could say more, he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muffled, distant sound of trumpets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teeva's red lips thinned, showing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight white line of her teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He wastes no time in coming," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Let us go into the throne room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is once I will enjoy seeing the High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priest of Raa." And with a quick, lithe</seg><seg type="columnLine">stride, she went toward the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor hesitated, not liking the decep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion into which he was being hurried, no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">matter how worthy its end might be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We really haven't too much choice,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene whispered. "With the priests al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready after our heads, we've got to play</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with Teeva. I'm as bewildered as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, but I do know we've got to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody on our side in this crazy place."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I want a look at this Sha-Topat, any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way," Ki-Gor answered gruffly, still re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusing to commit himself. "Let's go."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nepah let the jungle couple and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftains go past him before he moved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he drew a long, deep breath and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned after them, the odd, strained look</seg><seg type="columnLine">011 his face changed to one of relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Teeva led the way through two small</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms, apparently used for conference</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes, went down a hall past a door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening into an ornate bedchamber, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused in a curtained arch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait here until I summon you," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Ki-Gor.

He was looking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">an immense, square room lit by scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of torches set in brackets along the walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The floor was polished black marble, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls milky white, the ceiling a checker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board combination of the two colors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of the room where Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, a huge gold medallion, symboliz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the sun, was set in the ceiling. Sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly beneath it on a raised block of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white marble was Teeva's throne, a mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive, benchlike chair of black wood worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with shining gold. The low-backed throne</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the only piece of furniture in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Ki-Gor got his first opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see Teeva's courtiers and their ladies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both men and women were slight-statured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a frail, inbred look. Despite their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright armor and many-colored capes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, for the most part, had that feminine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconvincing appearance of girls dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as warriors for a pageant. The women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of them heavily made up, were like</seg><seg type="columnLine">replicas of the same empty-faced doll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The languid hum of the courtiers* con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation quickened as the Empress en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the room. As one person they knelt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining on one knee until she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled herself on the dais. Then like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaudy swarm of butterflies, they drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">JUNGLE STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in toward the throne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the black guards stationed every</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen feet along the walls, six giant na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives detached themselves and came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand between the Empress and her sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the open doors at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room the brazen tones of the trumpets</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded again, very close this time. Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor could see Teeva's profile. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly composed, her face giving no</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint of the bombshell she meant to explode</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the High Priest's benefit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN INTO the throne room marched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first of Sha-Topat's retinue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The trumpeters were in the fore, six</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaggering blacks, wearing lion skins</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown across the shoulders, their golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">trumpets held before them like glittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons. Next came ten priests in double</seg><seg type="columnLine">file, pink-faced, well-fed men, magnificent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly gowned in rich, yellow robes. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were followed by a dozen native guards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid in golden helmets and breastplates,</seg><seg type="columnLine">big, scarred fellows with the walk of cats</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the faces of devils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor couldn't help but contrast the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculated pomp of this entrance with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way Teeva had gone into the throne room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone and unannounced. One might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder who was sovereign here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As this thought passed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle lord's mind, Sha-Topat stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door, becoming immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of all eyes. He wasn't at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Ki-Gor had imagined him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was tall, a good five inches taller</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any person in the throne room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore a sweeping black robe, with a cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular design of the sun emblazened across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chest. This gaunt, big-boned man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of the paunchy softness of the lesser</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His stride was long, quick, aggressive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">He walked with his broad, slightly stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders angled forward as though by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer physical force he would drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">through any obstacle erected to stop him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a restless movement of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands even as he walked, a steady opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closing of the fingers, a twisting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrists. And Ki-Gor's quick eyes went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them before they touched Sha-Topat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face for much of a man is told by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, and these seemed strikingly ill-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">suited to a person of the High Priest's</seg><seg type="columnLine">size and character.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In contrast to his long, powerful arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands were oddly small and frail look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the puffy fingers like short, fat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirming grubs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was hard to relate those hands to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's heavy-featured, immobile face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had a broad, high brow, deeply cut by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perpetual frown. His iron-grey hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined by a gold circlet, fell to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. His eyes, so light a brown as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear yellow, were sunk deep in large,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bony sockets, further shadowed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bristling black eyebrows above them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauntness of his cheeks served to em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phasize the predatory quality of his beaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose and thin, wide mouth. His chin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden by a wiry, square-cut beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an iritating arrogance, the High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priest's entourage bore straight down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the room toward the throne. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred-odd courtiers gathered in a loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">group before Teeva were forced to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart, leaving an open lane for the new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty feet in front of the Empress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the procession halted. All except for Sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Topat knelt in hollow obeisance. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted his ruler no more than a perfunc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory inclination of his head. Then at a sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal from Teeva that they should rise, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long double file of trumpeters, priests and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards broke apart into two single lines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving a protected aisle for their master</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow in approaching the throne. Ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently, a person as holy as the High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priest had to be protected from jostling</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact with ordinary mortals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as Ki-Gor noted, though Sha-Topat</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his face toward the Empress, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the shaggy brows probed right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left among the crowd. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardedly searching for something or</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Teeva watched him approach, a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile pouting her sensual lips. "Two visits</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one and the same day," she said, em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phasizing the fact that the High Priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">was breaking precedent by this appearance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Empress of Atlantis is honored, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed. What great matter brings you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palace again, O Chalice of Raa."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her light manner immediately brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised looks from the watching nobles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though to an outsider her tone and w-ords</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAST-GODS OF ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">might seem commonplace enough, clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them it sounded like open mockery. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Sha-Topat was aware of any difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her attitude toward him, he betrayed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O Daughter of the Sun," he intoned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I come on a serious mission, one which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would discuss with you in private."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh?" she said, affecting mild surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and what could be so serious as to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">for privacy? I had thought that you en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyed doing your thunderings in public."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was no hidden mockery. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voice was yet mild, her gibe was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstandable to all: Sha-Topat did prefer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to humiliate her in public, openly display-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the fact that his authority was greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than hers. An instantaneous stir rippled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sha-Topat, though, was undisturbed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">her interruption. "The matter I come on</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not one for jesting, O Empress. Serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs and portents occurred in the Temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the regular sacrifice to Raa was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made at high noon, omeais of the most for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidding kind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw back his head, stared mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingfully at her. He was a forceful, dra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic figure in his long, black robe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Before proclaiming their meaning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people," he said with an insinuating soft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, "I deemed it--shall we say--best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inform the ruler of Atlantis of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">omens. It could well be that they are con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned with your--ah--immediate future."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused significantly. His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow flames in their cavernous sockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he held Teeva's glance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Before the high priest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">even knew the moves Teeva intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him, he was countering with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack of his own. Ki-Gor could see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was a wily, dangerous foe. By the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that he made no mention of the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple's presence in Atlantis, he was tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Teeva that either she would talk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in private about the strangers, or he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would loose a mysterious lightning bolt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own on her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Teeva was amused, not frightened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the threat he voiced. She had seen how</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly his eyes had gone in search of Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor and Helene, had noted the faint re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">laxation of his stern features when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain no public introduction of the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers had yet been made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't it strange, Sha-Topat," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have been toying with the notion of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">announcement to the people myself." She</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed huskily. "They will be quite over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come with so much attention, won't they?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her face sobered. "As a rule, they don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get too much notice from either one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The High Priest drew himself erect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then you refuse me?" he asked ominous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Teeva laughed silently. "Oh, no!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "You may have your audience. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, I rather look forward to it." She</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a careless wave of her hand. "Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, all of you!" she commanded. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mean guards and priests alike!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The courtiers and their ladies, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Empress' guards along the walls immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately started for the' door. However, not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single one of Sha-Topat's retainers so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as moved until their master* himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-turned and motioned them to leave. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was yet another insulting way 111 which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the priesthood made it plain that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">only allegiance was to their own High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the great doors had been swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut, for almost a minute the priest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl faced each other in silence. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as the frowning, black-robed man</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, they were alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" coolly asked Teeva.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sha-Topat's face was hard. "I'm a</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct man," he snapped, "I'll waste no</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. You will turn these strangers over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me immediately! You will reinstate Tal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his former place in your guards and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your personal favor. Then both of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us will promptly forget that these two</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish matters ever happened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Teeva studied her fingernails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought you wanted to speak of signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and portents," she said calmly. "Aren't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little confused?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sha-Topat's jaw loosened. He was as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tounded by her growing effrontery. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to regard her as no more than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his servants, and yet suddenly she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">acting the disdainful superior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must be out of your mind, wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man," he snapped roughly. "You seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be forgetting that you live your life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">28	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ease only through my sufferance. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">more insults and you'll learn how difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">life can be for my enemies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The time is past when you can frighten</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, Sha-Topat," the dark-haired girl de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared, her chin lifting belligerantly.

"What do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean that from this day forth I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall rule the Second Empire in fact in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of in mere name," she went on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Temple of Raa will become a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of worship again instead of a fortress</seg><seg type="columnLine">of evil manned by thieving scum!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHA-TOPAT'S wriggling, crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers splayed wide as anger foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained in him. He lunged forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught Teeva by the shoulders, jerking her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideways with cruel strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enough!" he cried, his voice cracking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the empty chamber like the lash of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kiboko, the brutal native whip made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hippo hide. "Drunk or mad, I'll hear no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more from you. I'm master here and I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay master." He began forcing her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her knees, twisting her down with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">relentless pressure of his grip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing behind him in the curtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">alcove, Ki-Gor's companions couldn't see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was transpiring, although they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the verbal exchange between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest and the Empress. But Ki-Gor saw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, as Teeva had guessed he would. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">low snarl sounded deep in his throat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an instinctive action, he went to the wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's aid.;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing was more despicable in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord's eyes than for a man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistreat a woman. And this feeling of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't one of the civilized niceties taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by Helene. He was simply following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the immemorial rule of the animal world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where though the male is sovereign, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surliest brute does not vent his temper</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a female of his same species.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor didn't angle directly in toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throne. Shadow-quiet, he went straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the room past the High Priest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then cut in behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turn her loose," he said loudly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bantu, "or I'll loosen your head on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sha-Topat had been so intent on Teeva</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had neither seen nor heard Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's approach. He had felt no need for</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchfulness, for it was unheard of for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone to dare break in on them. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wrenched violently about, his gaunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">face murderous with wrath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thick bristle of his brows lifted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise. His baleful yellow eyes locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Ki-Gor's steady grey ones. His wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin mouth twisted to reveal big, ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You!" he said, and the word was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thrown knife. "The stranger!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Teeva was on her knees on the dais.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sha-Topat's brutal fingers had ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the fastening on her gown, so that It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen from her shoulders. Her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thrown back as if in pain, her long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black hair framing the whiteness of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what Ki-Gor could not know was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that despite the red mark of the priest's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip on her fair skin, the look in her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of triumph, not hurt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Teeva had a knowledge of men far be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond her years, the intuitive knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a born temptress.

The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a heavy bar inside, which reassured</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor. Also, each room had a large win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow looking down on a stone court three</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories below. The wall all the way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground was smooth and windowless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleep quickly came to both of them, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, wary napping of the hunted at first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as their utter weariness asserted itself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they slid deeper and deeper into the nerve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less sleep of exhaustion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the hours before midnight, Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did rouse briefly twice. The first time it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a muffled cry from N'Geeso which</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him struggling up through layers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sleep. As the slurred, unintelligible</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmuring continued, the jungle man re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alized the little chieftain was only dream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of some battle or hunt, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep again before the 'pygmy quieted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second time he was awakened by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounting bustle and stir all about them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palace. He blinked at the window, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was still night. Then he raised on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one elbow, listening. Slowly, he remem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3--J ungle--Summer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bered that Teeva was to go to the Temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">at midnight, realized it would be typical of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to go with all the trappings of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">station. With a sigh, he lay back again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had no memory of the Empress'</seg><seg type="columnLine">entourage leaving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A deepening silence fell over the emp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied palace. Outside Ki-Gor's door, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black guards relaxed. There was no move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in the shadowy halls except the eerie</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance of shadows cast by the infrequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">torches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two false alarms automatically made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor less vigilant. That part of his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">which kept watch for danger signals grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">less willing to accept alarms sent in by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses. Like a sleeping animal, Ki-Gor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose usually remained sensitive to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scents about him, his ears continuing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sift the night noises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the Empress' departure meant she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had received the message that Sha-Topat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dead. Therefore, the jungle man felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">he no longer had to worry about a murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt by the priestcraft, and Teeva</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be too occupied for the next few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours to concern herself with her well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded prisoners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, lulled by fatigue and a false feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of security, Ki-Gor failed to hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint scuffling noises outside his window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dark, muffled shape slid down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, balanced a moment on the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow frame and then dropped softly inside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rope released by the figure wavered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moved in the dim light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost immediately the bulk of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">man dropped into view, felt for the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow frame and moved inside. One after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another they came in rapid order until</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight men stood within the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They seemed untroubled by the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. The man who had first entered went</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly to the door, satisfied himself that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was locked. He whirled, came back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bed, motioning to the others with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. As though they had been carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">coached beforehand, one black remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the window, another hastened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door separating Ki-Gor's room from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chieftains, while the others ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced on the bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor was stirring now, muttering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sleep, disturbed by the harsh scent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men. Then abruptly he opened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. The three men who had come to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">34	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the bed were almost upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE STARED DUMBLY, blindly, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fraction of time, his reflexes</seg><seg type="columnLine">clogged by sleep. He saw the attacker</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest his head draw back his right fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a blow. The mists in his brain ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded apart as he realized what was oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord writhed with sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence and the blow missed, thudding</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bed. Pie started up, grasping for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the naked knife he'd left beside the bed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As his fingers grasped the weapon, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three robed figures were on him, pounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him with their fists, straining to batter</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into quick insensibility. His knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">w-as torn from his hand and fell to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene's fear-stricken scream tore at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eardrums. The sleeping girl was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched up by the three men on her side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bed. Too bewildered to clearly under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand what was happening, she only knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hands were clawing at her in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, locking cruelly over her arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tried to fight, but her strength was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing against the brute power of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Terror seared her. She screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and then a hand was clapped over</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mouth and she felt herself rushed to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men paused there, wrenching her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms behind her and lashing them together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a rawhide strip. One of them reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the window, snatched in a rope from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which dangled a leather harness.. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning speed he slipped the straps over</seg><seg type="columnLine">her shoulders, snapped the belt closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her waist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The same man gave a quick jerk on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope, then the three of them shoved her</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the window. The harness cut into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her skin and she swung dizzily along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the wall, feeling herself being</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled upward in uneven jolting tugs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor was carried backward by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerted rush of his attackers, bowled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over before he could get his feet under</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The bed splintered and broke under</seg><seg type="columnLine">their weight. His body was a pulsing mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pain as knees and fists rained punish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lesser man would have lain helpless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupified by that brutal hammering. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Helene's first scream had struck him like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an electric shock as he fell backwards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pain he felt was as nothing to the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury against these murderous night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowlers which that cry evoked in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A berserk roar burst from his lips. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to hold him, but they couldn't. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insane, tearing might of his giant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thewed frame seemed to erupt at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He flogged about the collapsing bed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wounded python, tearing free of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantic hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He used his forearms like clubs. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked one man half across the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought up to his knees. He was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">free of them when Helene screamed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Prematurely, instinctively, he turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to her. And like savage wild dogs the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were on him again, pitching him for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward onto the stone floor. By breaking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious counterattack when he did, he lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the ground he had gained. Once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was under them, absorbing a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of their battling filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Ki-Gor was snarling and roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a beast, and though his attackers never</seg><seg type="columnLine">once cried out in either hurt or rage, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosive grunts and odd, rasping sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from their throats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came wild shouts and a brief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious clash of steel as N'Geeso and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George plunged into the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting down the robed man who tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar their entrance. The four men who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just swung Helene out of the window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled around, two of them drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">swords and running to halt the chieftains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others rushing to help subdue the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KI-GOR HAD FOUGHT to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He saw Helene being lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward outside the frame of the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow. He smashed his huge fist into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the nearest black. There was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap of bone and the contorted features</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly collapsed and gave like jelly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man gave a queer, disjointed leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">and falling, began to flop underfoot like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beheaded chicken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men were clinging to Ki-Gor's back, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, his legs. A single thought was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind--to reach Helene before she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn from view. He plunged forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAST-GODS OF ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the strength of a bull gorilla in his charge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For one, two, three paces, he carried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole mass of them with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they slowed him. In a frenzy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair, he tried to fling them off. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed a man's throat with his bare fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers. But his legs were beginning to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the strain, trembling beneath his.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like bursting flares, dazzling lights kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploding in his brain as the murderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammering he was absorbing took its toll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, they knocked his legs from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath him. He went down under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass. For an instant, they swarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and over him like ants about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken bug. Then lifting together, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaved him up between them and rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He struggled fiercely, but at last they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the advantage they had sought, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got him across the room. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were only four of them now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when one of them had to release his grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">to try to lash Ki-Gor's wrists, he tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">free again. As soon as his feet touched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, his fingers closed on the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and he reared to his full height, threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the robed black hurtling out of the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three remaining blacks leaped away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him, grunting like angered hogs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they saw their fellow thrown to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his death into the stone court. They knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">then that they would never be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the White Lord into the harness dang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling outside the sill. And assailing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears was a rising clamor outside the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Teeva's shouting guards battered at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick wooden planking with some kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">improvised ram.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately their reluctance to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons against him vanished. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't take him alive, at least they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">chop him to bits before making their</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape. From scabbards hidden beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">folds of their robes, they snatched out</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, thick swords.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They had the unarmed jungle lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemmed against the window. There wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance he could get past them without</seg><seg type="columnLine">sustaining a fatal wound. And behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sheer three-story drop. The faint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold sheen of starlight falling on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">greasy, sweaty faces revealed the bestial</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage which gripped them. The insanely</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubborn white man had frustrated their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully laid plans. They hungered for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his strange calmness, his utter lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear held them at bay for a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that moment was time enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">twin devils to smash out of the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them screaming, "Kill! Kill!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accustomed to no more than a pretense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of resistance from black men, the night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiders had been confident that their two</seg><seg type="columnLine">swordsmen could dispatch Tembu George</seg><seg type="columnLine">and N'Geeso, or at least hold them at bay</seg><seg type="columnLine">for as long as was necessary. Too late,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they discovered that the Masai and Pygmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftains were of a different mettle than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men of Atlantis. With the skill gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nered from innumerable battles in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack, the chieftains had made quick work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their arrogant opponents, leaving them</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking in their own blood as they leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Ki-Gor's assistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO OF THE THREE raiders</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening Ki-Gor died before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make a move. N'Geeso's spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheared open the belly of one, and Tembu</seg><seg type="columnLine">George cut the whole top of the skull</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the other. The third man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes started from his head. He gurgled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with terror and bounded toward the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow, slashing at the White Lord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jungle man jumped aside. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">black made no attempt to strike at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. The man wras intent on escape. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped for one of the ropes down which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and the others liad come, dropping his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword as his hands reached for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The momentum of his body swung him</seg><seg type="columnLine">far outward away from the wall. Like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled monkey, he skittered upward on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope, straining to get beyond reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he should swing back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And his frantic efforts were successful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for though Ki-Gor sprang up on the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow sill, as the rope swayed back he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the black was safe inches above his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a snarl, Ki-Gor caught the rope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looped it about his hands. He swayed back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bracing his feet against the ledge, drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope taut. Great muscles writhed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tortured outline across his bowed back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained out along his arms. An agony of</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort contorted his features. It seemed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart must burst with the terrible effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">36	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he laid on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then all at once the rope gave, snapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">inward with the violence of a released</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber band. The White Lord staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and would have fallen wrhen he</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed in the room if Tembu George's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't steadied him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help me hold it!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chieftains caught the slack which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay curled over the sill. Hurtling down</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the window, his face frozen with fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the raider who had tried to escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was still gripping the rope, his muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunched with the effort of climbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor and his two friends braced</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, withstood the shock as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope snapped taut a few yards from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. Miraculously, the raider managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold on, but his desperate efforts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save himself were expended in vain. Past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window shot the flailing body of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hitherto unseen blacks who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been anchoring the line on the roof. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been foolish enough to tie several loops</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his waist and Ki-Gor had dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him over the edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the second black fell, he clawed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man on the rope, wanting to cling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything which would break his death-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge. He tore the raider away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line and like grappling cats they plum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meted downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then as though a giant whip had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped, they came to the end of the rope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The one who was securely tied gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge bounce and lay joggling and spinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mid-air. The other black, though, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn free and dove on head first into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone courtyard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Withstanding the arm-tearing jolt, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor and his companions waited for feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come back into their strained muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then drew their limp catch up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. They had stretched him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor and cut the constricting line away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his stomach when the door crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">open and guards came stampeding into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CHIEFTAINS and the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord sprang up, ready for battle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many of the guards carried torches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they saw the grim, dangerous faces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three men at the window, they halted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hold!" cried their leader. "We fight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for you, not against you." His glance took</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the crumpled forms of the dead raiders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Are you outlanders mad, not to open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door so we could aid you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's eyes were grey steel. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no time for that," he snarled. "But if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been, how could one tell in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of treachery that your swords</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be against us, too? You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teeva's guards, aren't you? Well, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">has all the mark of her doing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tall, scarred guard leader looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished. He pointed at one of the life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less raiders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those are Sha-Topat's devil men," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed.

The final harshly snarled order</seg><seg type="columnLine">was given, the last frightened underling</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent running. The die was cast. Sha-Topat</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So with the unshakable confidence of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who has never known defeat, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed for a moment as he sat alone all</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had done in the past few hours and</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed himself a nod of approval. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tension which attends any struggle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnitude wras still with him, he was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied with his plans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slowly became aware of his thirst,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reaching out to the silver wine con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainer on the great, rectangular table be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind which he sat, he poured a bowl-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver cup to the brim. Lifting the cup</seg><seg type="columnLine">with both hands, he emptied it with delib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erate gulps. He drank without any partic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular sign of enjoyment. Wine would</seg><seg type="columnLine">quench his thirst and renew his strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for that reason alone, he took it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had nothing but contempt for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaknesses of ordinary men. He played</seg><seg type="columnLine">on those weaknesses. His hands tightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the empty cup. Only that accursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nepah had been immune to his lures. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tried to tempt him from his trouble-</seg><seg type="columnLine">making by offering honors, position, riches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he had tried threats. All attempts</seg><seg type="columnLine">had failed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Underestimating Nepah had been one:</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sha-Topat's few mistakes. He usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew men of that type into the priest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft while they were young, or failing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, he saw that some "accident" befell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the moment opposition to his regime</seg><seg type="columnLine">began crystalizing around them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even in that, Nepah had outsmarted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Despite evidences of unusual ability,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he deliberately had assumed a docile air</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he had won the friendship and loyal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty of the Imperial Guards, and strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, the confidence and affection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the common people. He had made himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hero to them, an always accessible bene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factor, whereas the rest of the nobility</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked on them as dirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, when Nepali at last felt himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough to oppose the priestcraft, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too much a public figure for Sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAST-GODS OF ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Topat to dispose of easily. The High Priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">had chosen a more devious way. By exert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pressure on Teeva, he had gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduced Nepah's power in the palace and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army, edging him out of affairs, reduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him in station on first one trumped-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">excuse and then another, until at last he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had the Empress send him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frontier on permanent assignment. Public</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame had fallen on Teeva instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sha-Topat for the officer's unfair treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sha-Topat had thought he had the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopelessly pocketed, and was waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army and the people to forget him</seg><seg type="columnLine">before contriving the "accident" which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would dispose of him permanently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet he realized now that Teeva and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young upstart had been in contact all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. They had wanted him to think he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had won. They had been hatching some</seg><seg type="columnLine">plot, exactly what he couldn't say, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bound to have some connection with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sullen unrest growing among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people the past few moons. Not even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody efficiency of his night raiders had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to crush that unrest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two outlanders, Ki-Gor and Helene,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't inspired this plot against him. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were merely convenient tools which fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">had provided Nepah and Teeva. Aye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those two had played it smart all along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the guiding brain had been Nepah's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A COLDLY VENOMOUS look glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered in Sha-Topat's yellow eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes, he had been too complacent for once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too contemptuous of an enemy. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought him to his senses tonight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What fools they were to think that he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sha-Topat, would ever surrender so ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectly. Well, they both were in for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eerie bass bray of the giant trumpet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the main altar room was beginning. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized ears, it would have sounded like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dismal wailing of a foghorn. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of Atlantis, it signaled the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Great God Raa in the Temple, told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his living spirit was speaking with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sha-Topat raised his head and listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the slow, measured braying. "The voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the God," he thought. "That's actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it is to the people." His lips curled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in contempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pushed away from the table and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am their god and the fools don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize it," he abruptly cried aloud. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am Raa! And that sniveling pair thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would give up my power!" With a sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hand, he knocked the wine cup</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He still stood in the same position when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scarlet-clad priest, his fat face pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">■with anxiey, came hesitantly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Sha-Topat gazed fixedly at the man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">noting the beads of sweat gathered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hog-like jowls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So they are coming, eh?" he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They can be seen from the steps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Temple," fluttered the priest. "From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the number of torches, the whole Imperial</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guard must be with the Empress."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the face of the man's nervousness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sha-Topat seemed to grow calmer. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are quite the roaring lion, Nabu, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're torturing a prisoner or flogging a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple girl, but you aren't so brave when</seg><seg type="columnLine">your precious person is in a little danger."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But a single slip, All-Highest," gabbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fat man, "and we'll all be slaughtered."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sha-Topat laughed mirthlessly. Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments like this proved why he was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">master and these others his servants. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale spiders his hands crept back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the edge of the table. An almost sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sual pleasure throbbed in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Without me, what would happen to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">jackals?" he asked pityingly. But in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart was pride, not pity. "Come! Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us prepare to meet our guests."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strode out of the door, his black</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe flapping about long legs. He hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a narrow corridor to a gallery over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking the main altar room. Standing two</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep along the walls of the dark gallery</seg><seg type="columnLine">were heavily armed native warriors. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">this height they could command any part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the main temple floor with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons. The High Priest paused, finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the stone railing as his yellow eves</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked the scene below. The fat priest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nabu, hovered restlessly about him, like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">awkward beetle unable to decide where to</seg><seg type="columnLine">alight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OHA-Topat's glance started at the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ of the huge chamber, passing along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kneeling rows of priests, each in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctive color of his order. In the pauses</seg><seg type="columnLine">40	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">between the deep, eerie brays of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">horn, the sorrowful wailing of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the front rank before the altar were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged, as befitted their high station, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests who wore the scarlet robes. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sha-Topat held greater authority. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the men who offered blood sacrifices</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Raa, who actually picked the victims</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wielded the knives. When they walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">abroad, men blanched with fear and wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men hid themselves, for they were guided</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the basest motives in their selection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of victims. Nabu was the chief of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">executioners, a lustful, sadistic man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">reveled in the liberties which his job al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The altar itself was a huge crystalline</seg><seg type="columnLine">slab, faintly gold in color. But it possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a property stranger than its color, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">being porous, it would slowly absorb the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood spilled on it, shifting in hue as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank, until it too became a deep, ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This drinking of blood by the stone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded with awe by the people, doubly</seg><seg type="columnLine">so since always when they returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple the next day, it had regained its</seg><seg type="columnLine">original golden color and was as translu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent as ever. "The God has drunk and been</seg><seg type="columnLine">nourished by the blood of his victims," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests would say. About their trick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">washing the pores of the stone clean with</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, they said nothing, and since no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a priest could approach the altar close</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to inspect it, none of the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stition-ridden worshippers had ever thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to doubt the explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And on the altar now, newly slain, lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">a native, his warm blood filtering into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing behind the altar was a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous upright statue of Raa, a golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossus dominating the entire room.

Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept in the Temple, only the Sun-Symbol</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be worshipped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The massive idol was expertly wrought</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was no representation of beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and goodness. The ancient craftsmen who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fashioned the giant had caught in</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal all the ugly brute powers, the lust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful greed-crazed emotions, the repressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil of mankind.

"They'll never</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspect a thing until it is too late." He led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way to a circular staircase, started</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. "Remember, Nabu," he warned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"hold them at the door until the trumpet is</seg><seg type="columnLine">stilled. That will be the signal that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting dogs have returned with the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlanders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But suppose the Empress pushed past</seg><seg type="columnLine">me?" quavered the distressed Nabu. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how headstrong she is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The High Priest snorted in disgust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not even Teeva would dare interrupt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prayer to the Dead. Why else did I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather all the priests and set them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanting, if not to make it possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold her as long as necessary. She'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see my body on the altar from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">door so she won't mind a slight delay, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it won't be more than that, for the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">landers will be rushed here through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground tunnels on zebras, whereas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teeva has taken the round-about route</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the city in her litter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The priest ran a fat hand over hit wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.

"I planned this myself. There'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no blundering this time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN THEY WERE at the bottoiri</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the steps. Two priests, their arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with gear, awaited Sha-Topat. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly tore off the robe he was wearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the men advanced with a vest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like garment of leather which Sha-Topat</seg><seg type="columnLine">donned. As he buckled it tight about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest, he looked down and smiled, his good</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor restored.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hilt of a ceremonial sword and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some five inches of blade stuck straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from his chest. The trick knife was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened to the leather vest, making it</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear that the High Priest had stabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. In addition the odd garment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped to allow room inside so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAST-GODS OF ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could breathe almost normally and yet at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time hide the rise and fall of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next he slipped on a magnificent black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gold robe which one of the men held</seg><seg type="columnLine">open for him. But when the robe was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened about him, the whole chest of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was disclosed to be wet with blood, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood of the man slain on the altar. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">small slit in the front of the garment al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed it to fit snugly down over the fake</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now the powder," said Sha-Topat. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must look the part. But be careful not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiten my beard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they carefully applied a grey-white</seg><seg type="columnLine">pallor to his face, he frowned, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about inquiringly. "Where's that ridiculous</seg><seg type="columnLine">idiot, Tal? He hasn't been forgotten, has</seg><seg type="columnLine">he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small, mincing figure hesitantly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached itself from the far shadows of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I'm here, All-Highest," Tal stut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. "But when your men rescued me</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Teeva's guards, they wouldn't say</seg><seg type="columnLine">why you wanted me. You--you aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry with me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You aren't important enough to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry about," snapped the High Priest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just don't wander away!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tal looked alx&gt;ut him apprehensively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All this bustle--what does it mean? Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there going to be any trouble?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no," said Sha-Topat shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But me--w'hy do you need me?" per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted the narrow-breasted little man. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew something dangerous was afoot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't want to be involved in it. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting with the white savage had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">harrowing enough to last him a lifetime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because, you little jackal, I mean to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make you Emperor of Atlantis this</seg><seg type="columnLine">night!" growled Sha-Topat. "Now stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the w?ay until I call for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with that, the High Priest strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the main Temple. The priests ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of him and lifted the dead native</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the altar, carried him away. Sha-Topat</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed up on the reddening stone, lav</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on his back, with his head turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the uncertain, shifting light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torches which illuminated the Temple, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled black form with the knife hilt</seg><seg type="columnLine">protruding from the chest made a realistic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough corpse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rushing back from disposing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead native, Nabu stopped before the altai*</seg><seg type="columnLine">to inspect his master. A grudging smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of admiration wreathed his fat lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the bowels of the god himself,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he swore, "I never thought until now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would work, but I'll even believe it</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself when I see you come back to 'life'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teeva's guards will dissolve into jelly</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they see this 'miracle'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH SUDDEN CONFIDENCE,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nabu turned and scurried toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. He was standing on the outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, a sorrowful, dejected figure when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teeva took Nepah's arm and stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her litter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surrounded by brawny guards with</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn swords, Teeva and the officer hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried up the steps. Nabu moved in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, opened his arms wide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Sha-Topat's last order, I stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to receive you, O Daughter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sun," he said shakily. "He said you might</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to view his remains and commanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to oblige you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then he is really dead?" asked Teeva.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They stood on the top step. Nabu turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointed through the dim Temple to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the altar. "You can see him there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he who was both father and son to me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pfaugh!" declared Nepah. "You've never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a kind feeling toward anyone but your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self." He inspected the priest suspiciously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, take us on down to the altar," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said impatiently. "From this distance, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be anybody lying down there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a thrice, we can go, O noble Ne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pah," said Nabu humbly, "but you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't want to interrupt the Rites to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dead. It would be an affront to Raa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chant is almost ended."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You priests had the rest of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry on your gabbling," muttered Ne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pah. "There was no rush about this cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony. He will be dead for a long time."</seg><seg type="columnLine">But despite his grumbling, both he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teeva waited outside the Temple. Reli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gious taboos which have been observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">since childhood are not easily broken. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong force of guards stirred restively</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the eerie chanting of the priestcraft</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and fell, and the unearthly roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great horn thundered -out into the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">42	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like the voice of doom. As Sha-Topat</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known, the chanting and trumpeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">would wash against the guards like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisoned wind, whipping up their super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitions and fears, reviving their awe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raa and his servants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Patience!" Teeva soothed the officer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Since this is the last time Sha-Topat</seg><seg type="columnLine">will ever obstruct us in anyway, I can wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite happily. There is a pleasure in hear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his death chant/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within the Temple, a red-robed priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered from a side door carrying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jeweled wand topped with a golden sphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He approached the altar and turning his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back toward the door, made ritualistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">passes of the wand over the supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpse. His real mission was to tell Sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Topat that the raiders had returned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">only Helene, and if Nepah could have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's frightened face, he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known something was wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had taken the priest quite a time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather up enough courage to tell Sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Topat that Ki-Gor hadn't been captured.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And while he had delayed, a second mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage had come from the palace, relayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one of the priestcraft's spies, telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Ki-Gor and the two chieftains had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten away from Teeva's guards and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared into the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sha-Topat's face swelled with rage</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he heard the report. But it was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late to stop the machinery he had set in</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion, and since his own life hung in</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance, he forced himself to remain calm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will go on as planned," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly. "But get Teeva and her warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Temple quickly and close the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors behind them, so no messengers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palace can reach them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His yellow eyes glared into the priest's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cringing ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the instant we are finished here,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said fiercely, "turn out every available</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, priest and warrior alike, to hunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">down that white savage.

As the man retreated into the ranks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his red-robed brothers, the braying of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great horn suddenly ceased, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraction later the chanting of the priests</seg><seg type="columnLine">chopped off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN who had just left Sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Topat thrust his jeweled sceptre</seg><seg type="columnLine">high.

Hear us, as you always have!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the utter silence which followed this</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstrations, Teeva stood stunned for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment.

None of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Teeva, or showed any awareness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the armed men marching toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">altar. Standing in utter silence, they kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes focused on the black form</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled at the feet of the golden idol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The line of red-robed priests before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the altar stood firm as Teeva approached,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming a living barrier between her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sha-Topat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Out of my way, you carrion!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst out at them.

His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark with blood, he whipped his sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">free of its sheath.

What could they hope to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain by this further angering of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Empress? He half-turned, searching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the Chamber with narrowed eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he felt Teeva's fingers clench</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly on his arm, heard her queer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangled cry.

But the priests were standing trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed, their eyes bulging, their faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked and unbelieving as they stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">.he altar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nepah looked at the blook-soaked stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment, his breath caught in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat.

The awful pallor of his skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to the natural gauntness of his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a grisly, realistic look of death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His motions at first were the futile, mind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less twitchings of a broken machine trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black warriors saw how the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of his robe was a red wetness, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the very center of the once-gold sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbol on his chest, protruded the sword,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the visible guarantee that he couldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet he was alive, or coming alive!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes, that was it: This dead man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming alive!

Slowly, as though drawn by invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">strings, his arms crept upward in supplica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He seemed to grow and strengthen as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if taking energy from some unseen source.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Abruptly the roar of the trumpet ceased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He lives!

They knew that Teeva</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ordered the High Priest to destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. And they saw now how Raa him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self had raised up Sha-Topat's blood-wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpse, and in a miracle of miracles, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">restored life to it. To their simple minds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there could have been no more terrible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more damning rejection of Teeva's</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority and ambitions.

He, who always was so calm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sardonic, seemed to go insane. Screaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">incoherently, he leaped for the altar, jab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing and slashing with his sword.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the red-robed priests had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned to watch him. The instant he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, they leaped forward like a pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dogs. It was a good ten steps to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder-high altar and the agile officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered it with darting speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For all the alertness of the priests</seg><seg type="columnLine">against just such a move, Nepah almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached Sha-Topat. If he hadn't disdained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of stairs built on either side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">altar, he probably would have been suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful. But he chose to vault up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone from the front. Under ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances it was a jump he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made easily, but chance directed that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should put his hands on a section slippery</seg><seg type="columnLine">with blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of lifting himself easily over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, his arms slid from under him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thudded against the side of the altar. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he could leap again, the priests were</seg><seg type="columnLine">clawing at him. Like a madman, he fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">free of them. He saw, though, that his op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity to reach the High Priest was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could have turned his sword against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red-robed pack and wreaked dreadful</seg><seg type="columnLine">havoc before they bore him under. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">his one flaming thought was to cut down</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sha-Topat, prove to Teeva's guards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickery being played on them. He un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitatingly gave up all chance of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fending himself against them to sieze on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">last fleeting hope of driving his blade into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hated man's flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he tore away from his attackers, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped his sword like a javelin. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no time for careful aim. A priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">was diving for his legs even as he threw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Let's see Raa send you back this time,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cricd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was falling then, but his burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were still glued to the glinting streak</seg><seg type="columnLine">which marked the course of the sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he went down. The distance was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">far for the blade to drive true. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighted hilt had time to drag downwards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thus, when the sword struck Sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Topat's chest, it didn't hit him point-first</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the full weight of the throw plunging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it straight in. The lower edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade hit him, and then as it encountered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resistance of the thick, hard leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket, the whole momentum of the wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pon was transfixed into a downward lash</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the heavy hilt. The sw'ord tore free</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the leather as the hilt struck the High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priest's leg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The force of the blow sent Sha-Topat</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering back, but the sword fell harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly at his feet. The concealed leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket had saved him from injury. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">best of all, Teeva's guards thought they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had witnessed a second miracle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As warriors, they knew that the sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow, even though glancing, had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough force behind it to lay open an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary man's chest. Yet the edge had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitten into Sha-Topat, bounced away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was no worse for the experience. Clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, the hand of Raa was upon him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been brought back from death once</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now he was beyond hurt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHA-TOPAT TURNED his back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd. He raised his arms in</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks to the idol. Then he dropped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands to the sword hilt sticking from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest, tugged the fake weapon free. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">position and his guarded motions kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience from actually seeing the blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he immediately cast it down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor behind the altar. Before turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">around again, he intoned a prayer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">god.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly now, life and expression came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the High Priest. His eyes blazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at the assembled throng. He pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an accusing finger at Nepah who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being held face-down by a mass of red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">robed men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I lay the eternal curse of Raa on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man," he declared, "and on anyone who</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this time on dares cleave to him.

She was pale and shaken by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildering turn of events. But she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fear of bodily harm at the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the priestcraft. Not even Sha-Topat would</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare slay the last descendant of the blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line which had ruled Atlantis since beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the memory of man, the line which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposedly been sired by the Sun-God</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you, O blind and foolish woman,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "let Nepah lead you into a vile</seg><seg type="columnLine">plot against your people.

He made her seem a victim rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a partner of the officer. And he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">her a way out of her difficulties by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple expedient of denouncing Nepah</seg><seg type="columnLine">and admitting she had been victimized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sha-Topat knew only too well how com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely self-centered the Empress was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how shallow were her loyalties.

That could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">better worked out in private, and he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would take only a few hard, flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">threats to make the Empress agree to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept Tal immediately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have publicly repented, Teeva," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said loftily.

He didn't resist as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guards led him away to a cell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">await his hour of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I-GOR WAS TWO-THIRDS OF</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance to the ground when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden clamor above him told that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape had been discovered. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking his swift descent, he looked up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two warriors thiust their heads out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window from which he had just come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellowed excitedly to their fellows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost immediately the rope gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent jerk. The blacks were hauling him</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward. He let himself slide dangerously</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast then, letting the rope burn his fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">risking a slip which would dash him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the courtyard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Below, he heard N'Geeso's alarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse, Tembu George's angry bellow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their voices told him he was losing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">race for freedom. The guards were haul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him upward so swiftly that even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he would reach the end of the rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">in another second he would be too high</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the ground to let go. Then like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooked fish, he would have to dangle help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly to the end of the line while they</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled him in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the two chieftains weren't about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him be recaptured. "Hold tightly!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned Tembu George, and then he and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the pygmy were running outward away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the building, ripping their bows free</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thongs which fastened them to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs. When they were far enough out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the courtyard for the men bending from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window to make good targets, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun and began to feed arrows into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, slashing them in over the sill</seg><seg type="columnLine">with deadly accuracy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor heard one of the Bantu guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">give an agonized scream. The upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement of the rope ceased. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barest fraction of time, though to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord it seemed an endless interval,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hung motionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then writh sickening abruptness, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging toward the ground. The rope was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still gripped in his hands, but he had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation of falling free. N'Geeso and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George had driven the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the window, forced them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop the rope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Down and down he fell, skimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">frighteningly close to the rock wall. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet above the ground, just as he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was hurtling to his death, the slack in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rope gave out. The tremendous strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">and skill acquired through years of tree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel acrobatics kept him from being</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped off the line or battered senseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave his numbed arms and shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment to regain feeling. Then he slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the remaining few feet of rope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped lightly to the ground. The chief-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains kept lashing arrows into the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he reached them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This way!" he said, sprinting toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">a narrow archway. "Those half-witted</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards will be glad of the excuse to switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">their chase from the raiders to us. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the palace will be on our trail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They raced through the arch, down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk and into another and larger court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard. The indistinct grey shape of wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose in front of them. By its height, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor guessed it to be the outer palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hundred yards to their right they</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard running footsteps and a hoarse voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to them to identify themselves. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the outer guards had been alerted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the uproar in the palace. Without breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stride, Ki-Gor ran straight for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Reaching it, he stopped, ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso to join crossed hands with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">48	JXJNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You first," he told Tembu George, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Masai leader stepped up on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, they catapulted him upward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ail their strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH A SLAP of his big hands, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftain caught the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, whirled himself to the top. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a maneuver the three had executed many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times in their adventures. Because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Masai's great weight, it took the combined</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts of both Ki-Gor and N'Geeso to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift him over any high barrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> N'Geeso went second, because Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could fling the pygmy upward without</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistance. The White Lord went last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since he alone of the three had both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agility and flashing power to get up with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out being boosted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as N'Geeso was safe, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Lord backed off from the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">judging the height. The guard had located</seg><seg type="columnLine">them now and was pounding forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring the information to other men on</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch nearby. The iron-nerved Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed unconscious of his danger, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth he knew he would have time for only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one attempt and he forced himself to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm and make it right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took one, two, three short measured</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps. Then he was driving head-on at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier with terrific speed. As he neared it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gave a tremendous leap, and his legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistoning, ran straight up the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above him, Tembu George leaned for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, his whole body rigid with anxiety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up and up Ki-Gor came, and then all at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once it seemed, his momentum was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inches below the the Masai's outstretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand, the invisible grip of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted him. He wavered, started to skid</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then for a fraction of time, his toes dug</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a rough place on the stone. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged his arms upward and caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George's wrist just as his footing</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke from under him. Grunting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain, the Masai and the pygmy hauled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him over the edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was too close," gasped Tembu</seg><seg type="columnLine">George. "We won't take a chance like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor sucked a great breath into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs. "We made it, didn't we? he growled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come on!" He caught the far edge of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the wall and dropped to the ground. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men followed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were in a narrow, deserted street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the darkness, a grey confusion of stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings stretched away on both sides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They were far more confused in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this alien environment than they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been in a stretch of trackless, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabited jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the black beard of Gimshai," swore</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso, in his despair unconsciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking his thoughts aloud, "in this rabbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">warren how can we ever find her? How</seg><seg type="columnLine">can we know w'here to go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though Tembu George shared the feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings of the more emotional pygmy, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept silent, waiting for the White Lord to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the lead. And now, watching the dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlines of Ki-Gor's face, a chill came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the black giant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will find Sha-Topat," the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">man said, and his voice was abnormally</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat and toneless. "After that, I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll be able to find Helene."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And hearing him speak, not for all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riches in the world would either Tembu</seg><seg type="columnLine">George or N'Geeso have changed places</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that moment with Sha-Topat. No longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">did they have any doubt in the final suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess of their search. They were three men</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in a city of treachery and death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and henceforth every man's hand would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be against them, but the two blacks knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that somehow, someway, the White Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring them to the High Priest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS THEY STARTED down the empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">street at a run, Ki-Gor's sensitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears picked up the first faint, distant pulsa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the great trumpet in the Temple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither of the black men heard it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't take him long to decide that at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of the night the sound could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that a religious ceremony of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind was in progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately for Ki-Gor, fear of Sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Topat's raiders kept the people of Atlantis</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their homes during the dark hours. Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept for dodging an occasional patrol of</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchers from the palace, he and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftains were able to thread their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the rutted alleys of the city in</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparative safety. And the clank of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons and armor always warned them</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the approach of guards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time the trumpet fell silent, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAST-GODS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor had the location of the Temple firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed in his mind. After that, no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">how often he had to retrace his steps out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of streets with blind endings or streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">that twisted off at crazy angles, an animal's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of direction always set him right</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours after leaving the palace, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the immense Temple of Raa. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was by far the greatest building in At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis, and even in darkness the huge tiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stone pyramiding upward, the massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns, were enough to give pause to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who thought to challenge the priest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft's power. This building and the evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">caste it symbolized both had survived for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Temple was surrounded by a broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaza. The sound and glint of armor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons told the White Lord that Sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Topat's personal guards stood watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the building. Though he said noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the chieftains, his heart sank. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes drained by while he studied and</seg><seg type="columnLine">restudied the scene, his mind grappling</seg><seg type="columnLine">futilely with the problem of passing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a cool night, yet sweat beaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">his forehead, broke out over his body. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a terrible, soul-rending responsibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">for every wasted minute. The torture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing Helene was in the hands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests while he hid in the streets like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened, helpess cur was unbearable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had to fight the crazed impulse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling himself at the guards. His whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">body cried out with the desire to kill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rend, to seek in frantic action some re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lease from the pressure which threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to burst his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet of his inner feelings, Tembu George</seg><seg type="columnLine">and N'Geeso guessed nothing. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a rock of confidence to them, a guar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antee that all would be well. They de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spised themselves for moving nervously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fretfully, when he showed no least sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anxiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then near the right comer of the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a square of light suddenly appeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A door had opened. Through it flooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">robed figures--the devil-raiders! Scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them carrying torches came pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the plaza, breaking into squads of</seg><seg type="columnLine">five and scattering out toward the dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erent streets which came up to the Temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4--Jungle--Summer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor saw many of the squads head</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the narrow street where he was hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den. The shallow doorway in which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the chieftains stood would be a death-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap if the raiders caught them there. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't realize yet that these squads were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being sent out for the specific purpose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding and killing him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back down the street!" he warned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE SPED ALONG, seeking a place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide. The block was a long one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the houses jammed wall to wall so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there were no alleys which offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape. He glanced back, saw how swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raiders were crossing the plaza. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't let them trap him now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes searched desperately along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building fronts, stopped on one house with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roof far lower than the others. He halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two blacks in front of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our best chance is to get 011 the roof,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told them, "and lie low. They'll spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">over every street around here in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hands were swiftly exploring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house wall as he talked. The mortar had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumbled away between stone blocks, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing narrow toe and finger holds. He and</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso boosted Tembu George up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low roof, using their crossed hands as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had in scaling the palace wall. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tossed N'Geeso up and the Masai</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the little man's wrists and pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor himself climbed the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall like a monkey scampering up a bluff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The raiders were half-way down the block</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he pulled himself over the edge, fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat beside the chieftain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All three of them held their breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering if they had been seen. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robed men sprinted past without hesitat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. For several minutes squads of raiders</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept going by, their only sound being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift brush of bare feet. Then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups of priests, muttering among them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves at being sent out on such a hunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor caught enough snatches of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation to know definitely that Sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Topat was very much alive. "They search</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us," he told the blacks. "It's lucky we</seg><seg type="columnLine">got this close to the Temple when we did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they naturally won't expect us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be hiding on their own doorstep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the acid of impotent rage eating</seg><seg type="columnLine">50	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at his vitals, he listened to the footsteps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the priests dying away and despised him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. In the quiet, he lay with his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed against the roof, and the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">hid from Tembu George and N'Geeso the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that his fists were knotted, his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid with the effort of hiding his true</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a time, he heard the soft, quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffle of bare feet in the street below. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised up, straining his eyes to distinguish</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three figures trotting from the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were three of Sha-Topat's devil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men returning from some mission apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the great hunt just launched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started at them, hating them in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment as he had never hated anyone be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. And then suddenly, unexpectedly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there flashed full-born in his mind a des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to the chieftains. His voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed them to their feet. "Stop those three</seg><seg type="columnLine">with arrows!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he flung himself flat,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted his legs over the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof, and finding a toe-hold, climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward toward the street. The raiders</seg><seg type="columnLine">were nearly abreast of him as he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. At such close range, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see his white body clearly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stopped dead, startled for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. One of them gave an explosive grunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of recognition.

"They'll get us into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple, if anything will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave the largest robe to Tembu</seg><seg type="columnLine">George and even then had to open some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the seams across the back and under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms with his knife so it would fit over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Masai's barrel chest. He fitted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pygmy by the simple expedient of cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the foot and a half of excess cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">which piled up around the little man's feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor's own robe fit him reasonably</seg><seg type="columnLine">well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He disposed of the corpses by tossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on top of the low-roofed house. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftains' spears and bows followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, for it wouldn't do for them to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with any weapons other than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">short swords and daggers used by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the three of them in single file,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with N'Geeso bringing up last, so the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger men to some degree could hide his</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller stature from view, started for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple. They had their hoods pulled well</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to hide their faces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They didn't hesitate as they reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaza. They moved boldly out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open space at a dog-trot, with Ki-Gor in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lead. Along the edge of the Temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">harness glittered as several edgy guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved out to view them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sight of the black robes apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied the guards for no hail came, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after staring a moment, the men drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to their stations. Since the raiders</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tongueless, Ki-Gor knew he wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to give a password or undergo any</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioning. But the problem that wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried him most was whether there was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular procedure for entering- the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had to gamble on getting in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same door through which the men hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">him had flooded. He had its location</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly placed in his mind. As he neared</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, he saw that an armored guard stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-legged before the closed door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His nerves tightened when the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely stared at him, giving no evidence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">budging. Yet still the White Lord kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAST-GODS OF ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on, holding the same course. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the last instant, as Ki-Gor's fingers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">curled to grasp his sword, the man par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tially turned and struck the door with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS HE STEPPED ASIDE, the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung open. A yellow-robed priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood revealed in the lighted passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now what?" he said, his bloated face</seg><seg type="columnLine">surly with annoyance. Then he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three robed figures waiting. "Well, get in</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, you stupid dingoes," he snarled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't keep me standing here all night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Keeping his head well down, Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed quickly past the priest. Tembu</seg><seg type="columnLine">George and N'Geeso were close at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels. The door banged shut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait!" cried the priest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor turned. The priest was staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at N'Geeso, his little red eyes measuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">and remeasuring the pygmy's slight sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. There were no men that small among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night-prowlers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You! Let me see your face!" he com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But it was Tembu George, not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pygmy who whirled and threw back his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood. "Aye, master," he said. He took</seg><seg type="columnLine">two lightning steps toward the man, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand still poised above his head, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hood away from his face. "Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horror carved the priest's rotten fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. His mouth flew open to scream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George was too swift for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Masai brought his doubled fists crash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down on the man's skull, and as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagged forward, the huge chieftain caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, hit him another fearful blow at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">With Tembu George lugging the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest, they hurried on down the corridor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the first stairs they encountered, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw the body on the lower step, hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make it look as if the man had killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in a fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half dozen times they dodged out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight to keep from encountering priests or</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards. But at last, realizing they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing nothing more than losing themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper and deeper in the priestcraft's hive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor decided they would have to cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture one of the robed men and take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk of making him lead them to Sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Topat,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He remembered from his encounter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sha-Topat in the palace throne room that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red-garbed priests were the elite, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore one of them would better be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help them pass the High Priest's per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal guards. Not two minutes later he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighted a paunchy man in scarlet hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing across an intersection a hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll come up behind him," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Masai and Pygmy. "But don't hurry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We mustn't attract attention."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ND SO THEY BEGAN to stalk him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the silent, shadowed cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridors, drawing up behind him with pains-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking caution. But when they were almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">within striking distance, he turned sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly into a side passage. When they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the turn, he had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Along the left side of the passage were</seg><seg type="columnLine">three open doors. Signaling the chieftains</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain in the main corridor, Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept to the first door, found the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted. Then as he neared the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">door he heard voices, one of them ringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chord of memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, it's you, Nabu," the thin, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing voice was saying. "It's about time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw someone with a little authority</seg><seg type="columnLine">around here. By the flaming beard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raa, do you priests mean to leave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting here until I perish of thirst and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weariness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sure you are undergoing great</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardships, Highness," Nabu answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">drily, "but by those two empty wine flasks</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the table, I doubt that thirst is one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor glanced into the room. The fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest he had been following was walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward a circular flight of stairs. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man whose voice Ki-Gor had recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Tal. The narrow-chested little man</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a few steps after the priest, wavering</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsteadily on his pipe-stem legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, by the way, my friend," Tal called,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to make his tone unconcerned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">failing completely, "what did you do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--uh--that jungle girl? I strolled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the women's prison awhile ago and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The priest paused on the second step</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stairs, half-turned to appraise Tal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His round, red-streaked eyes glinted evilly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forget her," he said softly. "She is</seg><seg type="columnLine">52	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond your reach."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's blood turned to ice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?'' cried Tal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The red-robed man's thick, loose lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivered in a smile. "She had the mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune to stab a priest," he said, "when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were staining her skin brown. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave us a good deal of trouble. We had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">punish her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tal frowned stupidly. "But she looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right when they had her on the altar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a mark on her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The greasy smile spread over the priest's</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole face. "Ah," he said unctuously, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we waited until after that to punish her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see, we threw her in the slave pens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those where we keep blacks captured in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gorge and in our night raids on outland</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages. We told them she was an outcast</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple priestess . . . one who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for much of their suffering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but who had now incurred the displeasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Raa!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started up the stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder if we'll find her alive," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, "when we go to get her for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrifice tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Kf-GOR'S MIND EXPLODED.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brute, berserk rage shook him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped into the room, and miraculously, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword was in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In three great strides, he reached Tal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He struck him a single blow with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat of his sword, hitting him across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the head. It was as if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocking an insect from his path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tal careened out of the way and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">full-length.

His glazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were wide open, but they saw noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor was over halfway up the stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Nabu saw him. The black hood had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen away from the White Lord's face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nabu looked into that face and went dead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white. He threw up his arms, his flabby</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth flying open in terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Ki-Gor struck! He hammered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sword into the precise center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priest's forehead, cleaving Nairn's whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and head into separate halves. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrifying force of the blow carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep into the evil man's chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jungle man tore his sword free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">With quick strides, he retraced his way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tal. He lifted the scrawny officer as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he were weightless, sped out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and down the corridor to rejoin the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chieftains. Tal was beginning to rouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Ki-Gor turned into an open room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What happened to the priest?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I killed him!" snarled Ki-Gor. "I'll kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all!" He jammed his blood-wet sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into its sheath. Then giving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmed pygmy no chance to question him</seg><seg type="columnLine">further, he brutally slapped Tal to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses. The chieftains had never seen him</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistreat a man before. They watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-eyed as he grasped the terrified officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the neck, throttled him to his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll lead us to her!" he commanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And if you ever hope to see another sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll get us to her safely!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tal's legs threatened to give under him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with fear this time, not drunkenness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His first look at Ki-Gor had sobered him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Patches of green mottled his pale face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivered and shook uncontrollably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor pulled the hood over his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and grasping Tal by the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ornate sword belt, shoved the cowardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobleman into the hall ahead of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tottering, retching, but forced onward</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a run by the iron hand gripping at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, Tal led them down a series of stair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, along increasingly damp and narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">passages. Convinced that if they encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered trouble with guards he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first to die, he avoided every possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, in the far depths of the Temple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reeled against a corridor wall, begged</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor to listen to him. He pointed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow bloom of light in the section ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. Along the vvay they had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been only a scattering of char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coal braziers to illuminate the slimy pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The slave pens are there, beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light," he panted.

The tortured sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the stench that drifted past that door</seg><seg type="columnLine">left no doubt that it closed off the slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite Tal's fears, the heavy-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, weary and bored as their long</seg><seg type="columnLine">night shift dragged near its end, hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at the four newcomers. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tal nor black-robed night raiders were any</seg><seg type="columnLine">novelty to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tal went past the first four guards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned right, into a small, cell-like room. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow-robed priest sat behind a table, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head dropped forward on his chest, snor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing softly. After one glance at him, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor took a deep breath of relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Close the door into the corridor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George," said the jungle man</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly, "and stand beside it."

The stench which hung in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF ATLANTIS	53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dead air was choking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the gloom, he saw the blacks huddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the walls.

But as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that every head was turned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his direction.

"What have they done</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you?" he said brokenly. "My darling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my Helene."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helene had seen the dark-robed figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing and thought she was to be taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the altar for sacrifice.

They had killed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet here in the stinking depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Temple was Ki-Gor, speaking to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She is unharmed, white man," rasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Bantu voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then sanity came back to her. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mate! Words rushed to her lips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands went out toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't touch him or speak," warned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same Bantu voice. "The guard watches!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She checked herself in time. "Thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Molaki," she murmured. " May your</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods bless you for the help you've given</seg><seg type="columnLine">me this night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black's answer was a rasping whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per. "Do not be misled, woman. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">only hate for both you and this man. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had my men protect you because it frees</seg><seg type="columnLine">me of my debt to this white devil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now you are free to kill me, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">54	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that it?" asked Ki-Gor gently, remember-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Molaki's angry pledge when after his</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture, the jungle man had intervened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to halt mistreatment of the prisoners and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get their wounds dressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right," the black declared. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you shouldn't be here, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests are hunting you. The ones who</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought us from the gorge were talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His legs had been badly cut when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was captured. He sat with his legs ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended in front of him. His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">feverish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I could call out to that guard now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd be a dead man," he went on. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to wait until you start toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, or maybe until you are just step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping through the door." He looked' up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor, his lips drawn back from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. "Then I'll call out. Then I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">my vengeance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor drew the hood back around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. "Very well, Molaki," he said. "No</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter what you do, you have my undying</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratitude."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND THEN grasping Helene roughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the arm, the White Lord led</seg><seg type="columnLine">her across the room. Still grumbling at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor's slowness, the guard moved ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them toward the door. Helene was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense, expecting every step to hear Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laki's betraying cry. She caught up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guard, reached the door and still the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bantu hadn't called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly Ki-Gor raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knotted right fist, sledged the guard on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of the neck. The man collapsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">without even a grunt. The White Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught him before he hit the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hefted him over his shoulder and trotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Molaki, saying simply, "Wait V*</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Helene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Bantu struggled to his feet, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildered frown on his hard features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You didn't give us away," said Ki-Gor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black shook his head. "I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to," he said, "but I couldn't do it. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought how precious freedom would be to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor smiled. "I didn't think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would. Quickly now, get 3'our men up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are going to have a chance at free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom." Urging them to silence, he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them his plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave Molaki the guard's sword.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with the aroused prisoners massed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his back, he went to the door, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocking the unconscious guard's voice as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as he could, he hammered on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, crying, "Open up! The wench is</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving us trouble!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guards never knew what hit them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the door opened, Ki-Gor and Molaki</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut down the first two men. Then like</seg><seg type="columnLine">water from a burst tank, the prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove out of the slave pen and engulfed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other armored men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Few of the guards even had time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw their swords before a maddened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming mass washed over, clawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them down by sheer weight of numbers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those that survived were thrown into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave pen, and their priest leader followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, after Ki-Gor had made him lead them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the separate cell-block where Nepah was</seg><seg type="columnLine">imprisoned. For once in his life, Nepah</seg><seg type="columnLine">was neither calm nor sardonic. Tears of</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy ran down his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor kept Tal with him, made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">take them to one of Sha-Topat's armories,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the newly freed prisoners obtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">swords and javelins. After that, they swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a swift dark tide through the Temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridors, capturing or killing priests and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards as they went.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A score of guards were drawn up out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the chamber in which Sha-Topat laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hard rules of his victory to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teeva. The sudden appearance of Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor's makeshift army almost took them</seg><seg type="columnLine">unawares. But they were picked men, hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fearless, and they held their ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Sha-Topat heard their cries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm, he burst out of the room. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost started from his head when he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor and a horde of filthy, wild-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbarians smashing at his guard. He stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered back a step, his white hands claw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and twisting over his robe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" he shrieked. "How can this be?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spun then, darted back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doom, slamming the door behind him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a bellow of sheer animal rage, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor struck against the line of guards. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of Sha-Topat was the lash of whip</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guards broke apart before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blonde-manecl madman. He burst through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gap in their ranks and in one great</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAST-GODS OF ATLANTIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">leap had reached the door. He flung it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide just as Sha-Topat sped through an</seg><seg type="columnLine">arched opening in the back of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KI-GOR DROVE past Teeva without</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming to see her. Through a nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row hall and down twisting stairs he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled in pursuit of the long-legged High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Priest. Sha-Topat was armed, a drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword gleaming in his right hand. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last desire he had in the world was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face the raging jungle man in battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached the huge chamber, raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the altar screaming to the kneeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards to save him. The shocked guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up in a mass. But they had no chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the High Priest before Ki-Gor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Sha-Topat reached the Altar, Ki-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gor was on his heels. The High Priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled, slashed wildly at the jungle man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing he could run no longer. His one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope was to keep the White Lord from</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounting the altar long enough for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned guards to reach him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He might as well have tried to ward off</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thunderbolt with his sword. Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered his way up the steps without even</seg><seg type="columnLine">pausing. All the accumulated hate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger of that long and awful night had</seg><seg type="columnLine">flamed in his mind when he saw Sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Topat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He drove the frantic High Priest back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the center of the altar. He lunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and slashed open the front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sha-Topat's robe. Immediately, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again, seeking for the opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge his blade to the hated man's heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two more close strokes and the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper part of the priest's garment hung in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leather vest he wore was revealed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the center was the metal catch where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fake sword had been held. And lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">down was the gaping cut where Nepah's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword had struck him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor's eyes narrowed when he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leather vest. Then, his mouth twisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">with contempt, he leaped forward, beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sha-Topat's sword aside and drove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of his blade through the gash in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stabbed with such violence that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged his sword up to its hilt. Sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Topat shuddered, horror contorting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. He dropped his weapon and stiff-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ened. Ki-Gor stepped away, his features</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sha-Topat went down slowly, his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrabbling the air. He kept opening and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing his mouth like a fish out of water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no sound came out. Then he slid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees, leaned forward and toppled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face. One violent spasm shook him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the High Priest of Raa was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor came to his senses gradually.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked about him and blinked. Crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about the altar were Teeva's guards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring strangely at the dead man. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no move to harm Ki-Gor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the door at a run came Tembu</seg><seg type="columnLine">George, N'Geeso, Helene and Nepah. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood the attitude of the guards very</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon then, for Nepali leaped to the altar</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him, harangued them savagely for</seg><seg type="columnLine">having let Sha-Topat fool them. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor walk down among them so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see his skin was truly white. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he showed them in the close light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">altar how Helene's hair had been dyed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her skin stained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now that you are warriors again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleansed of stupid fears," he said, "lead us</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the palace."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT TEEVA HAD APPEARED as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke. Like a pale shadow, Tal</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung close to her. "Let us avoid all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodshed we can," she urged. "Tal knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">the priest underground passage to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace. Let us go that way and we won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose any more men through battle with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bands of priests roving the city. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests will have to deal with me now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so we can get everything we want without</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nepah looked surprised, but he agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her request was reasonable, so trailed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">both the guards and the released prisoners,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they sought out the tunnel. In half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour they were in the throne room</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the palace. Teeva's first move was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send messengers calling all available war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors in the Empire to mass for her pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection. Then she had food and drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought for the prisoners Ki-Gor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The White Lord waited until the starved</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had eaten. Then he approached Teeva.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wanted two things," he said, "to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break the hold of the priestcraft on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjects, and to establish contact with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">56	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">people and the plenty of the outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Teeva stirred nervously, her eyes seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over the chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your first desire has been achieved,"'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ki-Gor went on. "Now let us speak of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second one. My friends and I are ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave Atlantis, and I would advise that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">send a mission with us to gather informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Teeva abruptly straightened. She didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him finish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sorry," she said curtly, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither you nor any of these prisoners are</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving Atlantis. I am prepared to be gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erous with you. You may live here as free</seg><seg type="columnLine">men." She leaned forward and stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "But none of you can ever leave."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But you said . . began Ki-Gor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She cut him off again. "I know what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said--but I didn't mean it.

"What</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lost colony you and Nepah were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to regain ?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no lost colony," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly. "We know we are not the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">whites in the world--that is, those few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us who rule know that--but the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">are taught differently. It makes them more</seg><seg type="columnLine">content with their lot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nepah had stood silently, shamefacedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Empress talked. Low-voiced now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "But Teeva, these people saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">your throne for you. You can repay them</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way. You must let them go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must?" she said. "Never again will</seg><seg type="columnLine">there be anything I 'must' do!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ki-Gor drew a deep breath. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken all he intended to take from Teeva.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If we can't go with your approval," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated with slow emphasis, "we will go</seg><seg type="columnLine">without it. And we are starting now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled mockingly. "Oh no.

"You put</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in command? By all the gods, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is more than enough.

No! I thought the lot of our people</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be improved. But it won't! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">never will!

The officer ran toward the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Break through these guards," he cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll reach the same tunnel by which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought you into Atlantis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men surged after him. Ki-Gor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">N'Geeso and Tembu George formed al</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield about Helene. The line of guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">held for a few minutes, but their heart was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in this battle and Ki-Gor's forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept them aside. Nepah led them through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the queen's rooms and into the abandoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">armory where they had first entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace. They had snatched every available</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch from the walls as they ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fumbled at the wall, and a block of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone eased open. "Take Helene!" Ki-Gor</seg><seg type="columnLine">told N Geeso. "You can follow the marks</seg><seg type="columnLine">you made with your spear in the tunnel."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the White Lord, Tembu George</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nepah stood back and helped speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excited prisoners into the tunnel. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">clash of arms in the hall told them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teeva's forces were closing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They pushed their way to the door as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear guard retreated into the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molaki was the last man in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get in that tunnel," ordered Ki-Gor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're in no condition to be fighting."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molaki gave him a taut smile and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm, helping beat off the guards trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">force the door until the last of his men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the tunnel. Then with Ki-Gor, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducked into the opening after Nepah and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tembu George. The,officer pressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAST-GODS OF ATLANTIS	57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden lever manipulating the secret door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it closed, crushing two guards who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tried to follow them in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time the guards broke the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, Ki-Gor's men were far down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel.

N'Geeso</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already sent parties out along the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gather in every available boat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within a short while, the little flotilla</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on its way across the lake. As they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the cavern, the bumbling Tal was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just beginning to put boats out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city.

Then Corony lurched back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the window with an oath, as a single,</seg><seg type="columnLine">padded footbeat resounded through the si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence, and a huge black shadow rose in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corony's arm spun up. A jagged flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire spat from the mouth of his revolver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Framed in the window, the black shadow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one arm flung wildly over its head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled backward and crashed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">OS	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One!" said Corony softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then another figure crouched be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him. It was Bruce, dragging a gaunt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray metallic thing that gleamed strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the uncertain light. Corony stared at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in amazement--at the long narrow barrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the solid mounting--at the strips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribbon-like stuff that lay beside it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A spitter!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bruce nodded without looking up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I use it," he answered jerkily, as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers strained with the mechanism, "for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting--mostly.

Give me a hand here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thing won't spin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corony hesitated. Once again that shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry rose over the clearing, penetrating to</seg><seg type="columnLine">every crevice of the lonely room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Corony strode from his place</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the window and leaned over his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion. His outstretched hand held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, take this.

I'll get this thing going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a word Bruce rose and went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening, with Corony's gun gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly in his hand. In the outer darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, shadows were moving about--many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. Once a great spear buried itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wall of the hut and clattered back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once, too, the little black automatic in Ker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's hand flashed up and barked an an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer, dragging a shrill scream from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time, motionless, Bruce stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his post. Occasionally he raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and fired, when the streak of flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst with living intensity through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. But for the most part he merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared intently into the wall of blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and followed the movements of the sinis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, half-visible shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're surrounded, Corony," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly.

Those devils are afraid of nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corony laughed. "Have you ever seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man, Kerman, who would walk into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">living chain of lead and like it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kerman's reply was to lift his hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire into the darkness. A swirl of smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">curled from his revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Four," he said softly.

The shadow of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">contorted body spread like a great tar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antula over the floor, hunched into a knot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He answered without raising his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know. Wait--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bruce made no reply. He turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head at that moment to look out again</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the torn window covering, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, with a cry of warning, jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward into the safety of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're up!

Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing heavy hurtled against the barrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you fix it?"

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers, wound about a bar of metal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained stubbornly to bend it back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape. And the words, when he spoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came almost in a sob between his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Impulsively Bruce stepped away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. With a grim laugh he dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corony's revolver on the table, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow light reflected its dull barrel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, in a stride, he reached the corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. When he appeared onoe more</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the circle of light, a long, heavy ax lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now," he said evenly, "let 'em come."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almost in answer to his words, a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">impact shook the door. With a splintering</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash of timber it burst inward, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bead of a huge battering ram flung into</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED TRAIL TO ZANZIBAR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. The protecting bar fell from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door-slot, cracked into splinters. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy clatter the door swung wide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a second a black shape hesitated on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the threshold. The big ax in Bruce's hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung back over his shoulder--and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended. The towering black form gur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled once, lurched forward 011 uncertain</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, and crashed mightily to the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly Bruce thrust the body across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came now in a rush of struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">black shapes, milling and thrashing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebony darkness. Only as they came across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sill were they visible, for here the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble light from the room glowed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely luminous glare on the glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies. And all the while the empty, dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the thing on the floor glared up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Bruce's heaving features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sweat coursed unheeded down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big man's shoulders. The huge battle ax</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a dead weight, leaden, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarl Bruce swung it 'round and gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it by the head, wielding the wooden shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">with deadly force on the lunging forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">that strained to pass him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hurry--Cor--ony--hurry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corony jerked an answer from between</seg><seg type="columnLine">his teeth. He was creeping forward now</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the floor, dragging the heavy machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun after him. In a moment he was under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the older man's feet, swinging the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Open--your legs wide, Bruce. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold 'em that way--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a fraction of a second Bruce let</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes drop from the entrance. And in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that flash of time a mighty black figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the opening. A great spear arm went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. The light flashed on a hurtling shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rigid steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bruce's arm went up too late. The metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft burned savagely into his flesh, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with both hands clawing wildly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim spear that seared through his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, he stumbled backward over his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion with a groan of pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The long, gray barrel swung into a rigid</seg><seg type="columnLine">position. Framed in the entrance was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">target, the immense form of a snarling na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive. Corony dropped his head and jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly on the trigger lever. The gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke into a murderous, spitting sheet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame. The savage, with the snarl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph still on his lips, raised one arm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly to his chest and crumpled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sharp staccato of gun shots rattled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the clearing. A livid sheet of fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorched the darkness, throwing into blaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing detail the writhing shadows that lunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from it with cries of terror. Corony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring with half-closed eyes down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black barrel, swung the muzzle deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a semi-circle, relentlessly back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, as the spitting flame cut into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark. And, at last there was silence, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corony knew the attackers were gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Corony--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weakly, barely audible after the din of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the recoiling machine gun, the name came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Coronv--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, Bruce?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This thing--for hell's sake, pull it out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grim-faced, Corony rose to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the floor. In the chair by the table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had stumbled in the agony of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound, Bruce sagged forward, his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging on his chest. In a last effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain upright, he strained backward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up at his companion. Corony bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him. Firmly, as his eyes found those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the victim, he grasped the protruding</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will hurt," he warned without emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pull it--out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corony pressed one hand firmly against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companion's shoulder. The other, slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, evenly, pulled against the tortuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft. Bruce's teeth clenched together as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half audible, whimpered moan broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his lips. Finally, with the bloody</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon in his hand, Corony stood up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Methodically he tore a long strip of cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his tattered shirt and wound it about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wound. Then with the lamplight glow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing queerly on his face, he stepped back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deliberately, abruptly, he went to the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed it, and as he turned slowly, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back to the wall, his eyes were once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again bitter and the snarl hung on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kerman, the intermission is over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BRUCE raised his head wearily.

With its each move</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jaguar spread claws as wide as dinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates over some new portion of it to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down. Just as a vastly magnified cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">might do with a rabbit. Only David's</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening advance kept it from sinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">its teeth into the colt's throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him horses snorted and stamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the white staring hysteria of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind so that their riders were hard put</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold them from bolting. The girl on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them stared almost as big-eyed, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth bitten over her lower lip as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured tensely:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be careful there, por Dios, Senor</seg><seg type="columnLine">David.

"You--like him?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">His question was almost an accusation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She didn't answer that. Instead she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though neither of them had known it</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, "Look, this orchid has a scent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smell." She held it toward him. He still</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at her, only unconsciously inhaling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flower's fragrance. She too, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious volition, drew closer, obeying</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own injunction to "smell". Their faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">were close over the flower's crimson con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluted lip. Then Dave saw her eyes close.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His own too-closely-focused vision swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond her and the flower was crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">between their lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She drew away slowly; her eyes opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blinked away an incongruous wetness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now I shall feel safe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave was drawing her back to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only looking his question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because," she confessed to his khaki</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt, "there have been times, since I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been alone, that I have been afraid--</seg><seg type="columnLine">amongst all these lawless men.

But not this evening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tomorrow I shall make courage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tomorrow," said Dave, "I shall go into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hills back there and collect a million of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these orchids."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TOMORROW. Manana. Everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens manana in those far places</seg><seg type="columnLine">South of the Border. Sometimes faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the North thinks. Next day, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot hills Dave heard a gunshot coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the direction of the hacienda. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">78	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't like that.

He started walking, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearer he came to the house, the faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked; till he was running; and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came quite close, his heart was choking</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his already strangled breath in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, for he could hear the inchoate</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamour of South of the Border that takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">its emotions noisily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he charged past the deserted ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vants' quarters around to the front that</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhung the river, people milled about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; peons, house servants, all buzzing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, mumbling, murmuring incoherently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like bees, hiveless, who had found a leader.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dave's anxiety flared to fury at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningless yammerings. A woman clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him screeching. He shoved her off</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily; and then he saw that it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluttery frail Senora of the house. All she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could pronounce was, "My daughter! My</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor daughter!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mob surged Dave toward a smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob; and that one immediately detached</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself from its interest' to coalesce with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the larger swarm and each shrill its com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Its interest had been Ramon. He lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">propped up against a moss-grown stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate post; he had bled frightfully; was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still bleeding through the fingers of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman who had a cloth to his chest. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could speak coherently, saving his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Grac' al buen* Dios!

"Perhaps some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Romero balateros down the road can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">organized."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramon waved the suggestion off with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a weak hand.

"One chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the canoe!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave swallowed and said the obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time. "Ramon, you will die here if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ramon's hand pushed feebly at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So will she--unless--" His face twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a wracked grin. "You said you wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go--some day, and I--I told you it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to be alone." His voice came</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger. "I denounce the fatherless ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal before God. I name him for the ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand sins of his mother. I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TIME! Dave shoved the chittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">peons from before him and tumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the river embankment. Over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzing of the swarm that he left behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could hear Ramon's fearful invective</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was taking with him to lay before</seg><seg type="columnLine">God. Dave fell into the canoe, nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamped it--baled it frantically and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't know what he was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do: or what he could do--alone. The race</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the river gave little opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan; the strain of sheer physical endeavor</seg><seg type="columnLine">for speed left scant room for thinking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Speed! For what? Vaguely the pattern</seg><seg type="columnLine">set itself in his mind that he must contrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cut off the raiders somewhere along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path. Vaguely, too, came a small comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing reminder that his rifle that he always</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried into the jungles still bumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his back on its web strap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Speed! Time! How far might six hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing men have shoved, hustled, carried a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl along a jungle trail in two hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">start? Too far! The mounting rage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">futility burned in each heaving gasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The canoe was looking down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maw of the gorge before Dave had co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">herent plans. But hope, at least, had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. Ten miles of rapids, Ramon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him, roared through that defile. There,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Heaven, would be speed! Much faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">than men on a rocky path. IF--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shot the canoe into the suck of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark water between the granite buttresses</seg><seg type="columnLine">that scowled their "keep out." The gorge</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared in his ears and took hold of him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a liquid avalanche that showed him how</seg><seg type="columnLine">puny were strong muscles, and a fine spray</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dimmed the bulk of rocks wickedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, rushing up at him, gnashing jagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. Speed, at all events, he had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Canoes, Ramon had said out of his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience, didn't live in that gorge--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon, disaster came as easily as disaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">always can. An insignificant submerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">MATTO GROSSO FURY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">79</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, hardly big enough to cause any sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face flurry, took the edge of the canoe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned it neatly over. Dave was plucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and rolled under and over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around like any other flotsam before an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other rock deflected him again to the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Death, Ramon said, lived in that gorge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Death was undoubtedly preparing to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">business; but Death, alone of all con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingencies, always had Time. As yet, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river played with Dave; sucked at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spewed him out, tossed him, hurtled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, spun him, finally playfully into an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eddy where Dave was able to swim to and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutch at a great snag of a tree left</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranded from last season's rains. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to haul himself along to where its</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered stem was imbedded in a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">oasis of clean white sand littered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">other flotsam. With the help of a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray root he was able to heave himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet and he tried to shout his exul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation, but all he succeeded in doing was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">belch hugely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thought surged in his mind. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">won TIME! Surely that, at least. No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body could have traveled the twists and ups</seg><seg type="columnLine">and downs of a cliffside trail with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful speed. They would be coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">along presently, dragging Jane with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">damn their black souls. And then what?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Six of them. Dave still had had no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think what he might do but they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be along. Surely they would be coming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fate, even in this savage country, couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be so brute merciless as to have let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">already go by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must find the trail, wherever it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be winding and dipping along on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillside behind him. He must contrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. Some desperate thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be good against six armed men. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must--and then Dave knew that the Fates</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the gods who ruled here were those</seg><seg type="columnLine">sardonic heathen ones who grant favours</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take their payment in immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted antithesis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lived, and he had won Time. But--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked madly at his hillside, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, at the river; and he saw it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail! There it was, an unmistakable beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">path, dipping down from broken rocks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross a strip of sandy beach--And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute gods of the river and jungle had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spewed him out on the other side!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RIVER raced along, chuckling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roaring its laughter at him. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile--two miles--he couldn't see how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much farther the rapids extended. Thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet across--a little thirty feet. But noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing alive could' swim across; not even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish. The best they could do was to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves be whirled down a mile in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes and then work their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, snuggling banks and backwaters, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave's reaction of exhaustion swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him and he sagged down against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead tree. Even his futile hope of cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the gang was hopeless. He lay a shape-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less heap on the hot moist sand, numb in</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, dead in mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Till suddenly above the roar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, he was conscious of a muted shout.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More shouts.

Thirty feet away; only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little thirty feet across an uncrossable</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulf!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then those heathen gods laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him and told him what a Man could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. It seemed to Dave that he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes staring at him out of jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows, cynical, malicious. He could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">their voices chuckling in the river:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Civilisation ends at your American</seg><seg type="columnLine">border■"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave's voice coughed some of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">water from his lungs to croak a hoarse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Or" the insidious voices chuckled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"does it end when things come very close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to home?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dave said nothing.

According to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good Father's account there were inscrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions carved in the face of the cliffs near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He unrolled two maps on the table; one</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large scale map of the district, the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">procurable he assured me. The other was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quaint old map made bv Father Jerome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were neat little drawings of castel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated towns showing the position of native</seg><seg type="columnLine">kraals and all the chiefs thereof were called</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dukes" "Marquises" and "Counts." I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered that the old missionary must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have run into a good deal of lion trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had been seeing them in his sleep, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had written across all the empty spaces;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"hie sunt leones."

I thought that if the ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrine were half of what Father Jerome</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it out to be, the Zu-Beni who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to inhabit the district, would be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give us information. What bothered me</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the fact that I would have to hire</seg><seg type="columnLine">porters at Ngomano. Not that I had any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing against the Companhia do Nyassa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I did have plenty against Senhor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manoel Barahona, their agent at the post.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wrhen I was a raw lad, just out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the States, I'd signed up with the Company</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they had sent me up to Barahona as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his assistant. He was a big brute of a man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd been a ship's officer and still thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was slave driving. He ran the post like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bucko mate. Life had delt kindly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me up to the time I arrived at Ngomano,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mine was the self-assurance, the arro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gance of the youngster who has yet to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLOOD FOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his chastisments. I ran foul of him about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week after my arrival. He gave me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst beating I've ever taken and kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">me out.

The tapping of coopers' hammers com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the oil shed made an accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paniment to their toneless chanting. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stench of palm-oil and dried fish hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a haze over the hard, red earth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I headed straight for the store.

A couple of white men lounged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rattan chairs with a table between them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking gin. I didn't know them, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed that one of them was Barahona's</seg><seg type="columnLine">candidate for my job. The Senhor himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">was talking to the Professor with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbows resting on the counter. He hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed much either, a little flabbier, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps. His skin was blotchy and the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">bags under his close-set eyes were more</seg><seg type="columnLine">conspicuous than when I'd last seen him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he was still a very big hunk of man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the old fear and hatred of him struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my stomach like fangs.

I walked up to the counter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment the power of speech seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to desert me, then pent-up hate poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of me like bilge-water. My Portu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guese was not of the kind one sees in</seg><seg type="columnLine">print but it was fluent, rich in burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">oaths and invective and I'd had five years</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which to compose a suitable verbal</seg><seg type="columnLine">description of Barahona's attributes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">two Portuguese were staring at me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mouths hanging open. Barahona</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened with a fixed smile on his thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips until I ran down like a mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">toy. Then he turned to the Professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head and said in English:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see what a man he is?

It was a sharp, sting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blow and when he wiped his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood showed on the b&amp;tk of his hand. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at it with a surprised expression,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then roared out a string of oaths and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaulted the counter. The board floor shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bottles rattled on the shelves as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on my side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Often I had dreamed of this moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had planned what I would do to the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail.

I kicked him off and got a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hard blows home to the pit of his stom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ach. He roared and came at me with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head down. He hit me again and again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The room whirled; I lost all sense of time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barahona's face grimaced at me out of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">red haze; I smashed at it desperately while</seg><seg type="columnLine">his punches thudded into my body, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded in my face. I wondered vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I was still on my feet. I saw Barahona</seg><seg type="columnLine">stagger back against the counter; he reeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">along it and his breathing filled the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I knew I was on my feet because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he couldn't kock me down. A hoarse yell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of exultation came to my lips with bubbles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood. I leaped at him and struck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck in a kind of frenzy until he lay at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet groaning; his face beaten into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody pulp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I became aware of the Professor's voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was pulling at my arm;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come away, Buckland!" he urged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come away!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I followed him in a daze; my legs feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as if hundred pound weights were</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to them.

They rose before us in two pitches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosing and concealing a labyrinth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">valleys, some shallow and several miles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">breadth; others deep, narrow and as dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late that afternoon we came out onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly open and elevated country with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorgeous view of the Chengwari range. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foreground a massive lump of granite</seg><seg type="columnLine">reared two hundred feet above the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms and mimosa with their cream balls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feathery foliage. It divided the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">into twin streams. The streams raced be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween high wooded banks that threw a cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">green light on the swift-flowing water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Herds of gazelles zig-zagged across patches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of amber pasture land, their beige and white</seg><seg type="columnLine">markings merging with their background</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that they were seen and gone in a flash.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A path branched off from the river. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat broader than the usual jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">"road" which is seldom wider than a man's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">foot. A little farther on we came across a</seg><seg type="columnLine">log buried across the path and dirty rags</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluttered from stripped palms on either side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trail,--charms to keep ghosts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leopards away from the village I knew must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be nearby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although I had not mentioned it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor, the fact that we'd seen neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide nor hair of the Zu-Bengi had begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">to worry me. We were getting low on sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies. We knew that we must be in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicinity of the temple, but without a guide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we might wander among the hills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the maze of canyons for a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">and never find it. However, it was dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we came in sight of the village and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since your African's an unpredictable cuss</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his best, especially so if you sneak up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him after dark, I gave orders to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER WE'D FINISHED our meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor and I sat talking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking in the moonlight that filtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the trees in the glade where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had our camp. All around us were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night noises of the forest, its unaccountable</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoing and ghost-like sighing. From across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest hill came the muffled sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum tapping and the moaning wail of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horn or conch. It had a peculiar tone, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather two tones, so that one seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear it first with one ear then with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. I'd never heard anything quite like</seg><seg type="columnLine">it before and I sat listening with my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocked on one side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's not unlike the moan of a lion,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Or one of the guardian spooks of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple," I said jokingly. Then something</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened that made me stop joking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bwana! Bwa--na!" Kula's voice rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a scream that had mortal terror in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Professor and I sprang to our feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran to the back of the camp. Kula was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing on top of a packing case under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree where he had set up his oil-tin stove.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was an oil lamp fastened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunk of the tree. It's flickering light</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed on his black, rigid figure and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white under-belly of a cobra. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">six feet long if it was an inch. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reared up one third of its length and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">distended hood was close to Kula's bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. The poor devil was petrified with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fright and dared not move. The cobra was</seg><seg type="columnLine">86	JUNGLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hissing loudly and I knew it was prepar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to strike. I clawed at my gun. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had it clear of leather, flame flashed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore my eyes and two reports slammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against my ear drums. The cobra's head</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared, blown clean off! Stupified, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to stare at the Professor who stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a smoking automata in his hand. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave me a queer little smile, then slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun into a holster under his arm, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away. The shots had roused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp and the men were standing around</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabbering like a cage full of baboons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kula had gone after the Professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his hand and was pouring out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratitude. I got the men quieted down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to join Hurst. I didn't speak as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down facing him. I figured it was up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him to do the talking. There was silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment and then;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're thinking of pop-guns, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buckland," said he with a quizzical smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are uncommonly fast with the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing," said I. "I didn't know it was your</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit to carry a gun." I might have added</seg><seg type="columnLine">I liked a man to carry his weapons where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could be seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That snake," said he with a dry cough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"was one of the imponderables, the sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thing a man can't foresee."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't need to apologize for that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said I. "But let me have it straight.

" I don't like being led by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nose into anything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE REMAINED SILENT, evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning something over in his mind;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look Buckland," he said at last. "I'm not</seg><seg type="columnLine">at liberty to speak too freely. You'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fill in some blanks. To begin; for you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war was over in 1918, but for men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my profession the end of one war is just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning of another. That may sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">cynical when everyone is quoting Tenny-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, talking about the brotherhood of man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But that's the way it is.

I urged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I thought you knew about those rifles,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he. explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You suspected me!"

"But it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be worth your while if you do. Think it</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. Sleep on it, Buckland." He went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tent, leaving me to think it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1MUST HAVE SAT THERE for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time. I don't know what it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that disturbed my concentration, but some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing did. I rose with a tingling sensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">running up and down my spine. The camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quiet. A light wind was rustling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm fronds and threw moving shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLOOD FOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">across the clearing. A jackal howled like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lugubrious spirit close to the camp. Think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that it had been just such a prowler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosing among Kula's pots, that had roused</seg><seg type="columnLine">me I started for my tent. I had taken no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a couple of steps when the conch</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'd heard earlier in the evening blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silence. It was followed by the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of people crashing through the bush. Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures rushed at me from all directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 got my gun out but was snatched from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand before I could pull the trigger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I went down, kicking and yelling, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mass of greasy, stinking blacks. I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurst's gun go off. I struggled to my knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A blow from a knob-kerry silenced me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When my head stopped spinning, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them dragging Hurst toward me. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">yanked us to our feet and bound our hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind our backs. Then they yoked us to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether with a pole that had a loop at each,</seg><seg type="columnLine">end to fit around our necks. It was the sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thing the slavers had used in the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. They left us standing while they</seg><seg type="columnLine">looted the camp. They were all big fellows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with square ox-hide shields and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears. They went through our stuff like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch of women at a rummage sale. I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a real shock when I saw our own men</seg><seg type="columnLine">join in the fun, and I understood why</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barahona hadn't interfered* when I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hired them. He was mixed up in the gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">running all right!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A group of blacks bundled up their loot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and formed a line on either side of us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They yelled at us in a dialect that struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ear as similiar to that of the Intotela</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Tanganyika, but I couldn't catch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. However, they made their meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain enough when they prodded us into</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion' with the points of their spears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt sorry for Hurst as we trudged</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the narrow foot-path toward the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage. He wras in the lead and I was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice his size. The result was that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weight of the slanting pole sitting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of his neck. He staggered on with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a whimper; even flung back a joke or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two at me. Just a little guy with more guts</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a million. I could have blamed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fooling me into the mess we were in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I'm glad I found the fortitude to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with the chafing of that damned pole</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to keep my mouth shut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was still dark when we reached the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE JUJU	87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">village w'hich,--thank God,--was no great</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance from where we had camped.

Around her slen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der ankles and wrists were strings of blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">beads and the whole length of her left arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost from shoulder to wrist was orna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented scars, about the size of a wafer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An attendant placed a stool before her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">another opened an umbrella, one of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">green variety, a popular article of trade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She sat down under it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hurst coughed dryly; "If that's Mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doma," he whispered.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">wits were sharper than mine. Evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd decided to gamble on what I'd told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him of Memdoma, for he started to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fluent German! I couldn't understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he was saying, but the girl did. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression changed from open disbelief to</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzlement. She asked questions. Hurst</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered glibly. The native name Mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doma was mentioned several times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the girl seemed satisfied.

The in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior was furnished with skilfully woven</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables and chairs of rattan. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged tri-color of bunting hanging above</seg><seg type="columnLine">a skin couch,--what was left of a German</seg><seg type="columnLine">flag. As my eyes grew accustomed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim light, they came to rest on the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man that reclined on the couch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was the skeleton of a man with knot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted fingers and sunken chest, a body wasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by fever and dysentery.

Evident-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly Barahona's name was no recommenda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in Amatupa. I started to walk back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hut, wondering if I'd knocked the props</seg><seg type="columnLine">frotn under Hurst's flimsy story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VILLAGERS were still dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the ju-ju tree, and the compound</seg><seg type="columnLine">was full of dust and clamor. Two big In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">totelas detached themselves from the crow'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">and followed me at some distance. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled around a group that stood watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dancers, a native, bent double under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle of firewood, jarred into me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed at his load to prevent him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">toppling over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will come tonight, Bwana!" Kula's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice came from under the bundle. I threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quick glance over my shoulder and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Intotela guards bearing down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep going!" I hissed at Kula and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered on. The two Intotelas escorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to the hut and squatted down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade of the thatch near the opening. Goat's</seg><seg type="columnLine">milk, cassava and a calabash full of an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">palatable mixture of grain and putrid meat</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been placed on the floor. But the milk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after I'd skimmed a handful of bugs from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface, was sweet. I w'as hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to tackle the mess in the calabash</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Hurst showed up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, who's the girl?" I asked as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave me an amused look. "I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's natural at your age," said he. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she's one of the many children born to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Memdoma by native women. Brought her</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him from German East Africa."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's not that much black in her,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who said there was?

Does that satisfy</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, sure!" I agreed. "Just natural curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity. Did he mention Barahona?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave me a sharp look. "He did.

"It won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make any difference for us. He's mad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buckland, stark, raving mad! Disease has</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected his brain I suppose. He still thinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's fighting us. When I told him the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over and Germany had lost, he flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a rage and had me kicked out. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">downright pathetic to hear him talk of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">campaign he is going to wage to recover</seg><seg type="columnLine">all German territory in Africa."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But surely the others, --" I began.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," he interrupted. "All they know of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside comes through Barahona. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend makes a trip up here occasionally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for obvious reasons he has said nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturb Memdoma's illusions. On the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trary, he's been filling him up with stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">of German victories."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reasons were not so obvious for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I said so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's simple enough, Buckland," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained. "As I told you, we know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barahona has been shipping out gold-dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">in greater quantities than could be acquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the usual practice of the Company agents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We also knew that he had acted as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">under-cover man for the Germans during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war. Somehow, through the same under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground channels he used during the war</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably, he got to know what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to Memdoma. As you guessed, Mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doma ended his retreat out of German East</seg><seg type="columnLine">here at Amatupa. Now, those rifles, traded</seg><seg type="columnLine">for gold-dust and ivory, are worth a fort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">une. Barahona saw that, but he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do anything about it, not while Memdoma</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," I agreed. "The Intetola w'ould</seg><seg type="columnLine">have killed him, if he'd lifted a finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">against their hero, Memdoma."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly. All Barahona could do was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuade him to sell a few of the rifles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay for his services and to buy supplies</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the campaign that poor devil thinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's going to wage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Barahona is just waiting for Memdoma</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die, then he's going to take over the lot!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got it, Buckland! And my guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that Barahona will follow us here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded thoughtfully. It was obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had sent his men along just to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that we did not get beyond Amatupa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLOOD FOR THE JUJU.	91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The girl must have talked to our fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows," I reasoned. "She knows what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are after. But there's something between</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and Barahona." I could have told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it was, but I didn't think he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Memdoma will hold us till Barahona</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes in," said he. "We've got to get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of here before that happens, Buckland."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him of my meeting with Kula.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think he'll show up ?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gave him a confident grin; "I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kula.

A couple of hours later</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barahona marched in with a string of Swa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilis behind him, all armed with muskets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The leading men of the Intotela had gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered in the compound to receive him. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">we watched from the door of our hut, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed in a semi-circle under the ju-ju</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, with Barahona and his men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">centre. I guessed that there was to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big palavar and that our fate was the topic</seg><seg type="columnLine">under discussion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It looks ugly," commented Hurst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was watching Barahona.

Right then I would have given ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of my life to know what he was tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them. I could see that he was working</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up to do something. Presently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">witch doctors, in hideous masks and grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloaks that covered them from head to foot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began their capers in the centre of the gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering. They kept up their macabre antics</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some time, then suddenly one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched a spear from one of the warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flung it in the direction of our hut.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew what that meant; we had been smelt</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is it, Hurst!" I shouted and pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head back into the hut. In a moment the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors had followed the spear and came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">howling like a wolf-pack, to drag us out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I let the first one that thrust his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the low opening have my boot full</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the face. His body blocked the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening and gave me time to grasp his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear. For a while I held them at bay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I heard them tearing holes in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Dark Continents</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Your Mind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DO YOU struggle for balance?

They dropped on us from the roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ju-jutsu must have been part of Hurst's</seg><seg type="columnLine">training. Whenever he got his hands on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them the fellow screamed as a bone</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped. He stayed on his feet as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did. It was hopeless, of course.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear Hurst swearing softly and flu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently above the excited yapping of the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagers. Barahona was standing with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on his hips, watching us with a sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donic grin on his face. Then I saw Mahara.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She w'as seated among the elders. Her chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cupped in her hand and her gaze was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed steadily on me. As our eyes met, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved her hands in a swift gesture, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came to rest in her lap; for an instant it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was extended toward me, palm upwards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My pulse quickened with a thrill of hope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the conventional native gesture sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nifying peace.

"By this time you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must know that when you came to Ngo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mano and told me you were an archaeolo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gist looking for a temple, that you told it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wrong man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think so," replied Hurst cooly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When I told it to my friend, Mr. Buck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, I told it to the wrong man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barahona looked puzzled; then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed; "Under the circumstances I find</seg><seg type="columnLine">it hard to follow you, Senhor!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Permit me to explain," Hurst mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mured.

"As I was saying, when my em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployers handed this case over to me I</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied all the relevant facts and drew up</seg><seg type="columnLine">my plan of action. As I saw' it, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only two possible culprits; Mr. Buckland</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yourself.

Why?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, Senhor, because the guilty man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clever fellow.

Oh, I see that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are beginning to understand!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BARAHONA was plainly worried. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was staring at Hurst with his loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth hanging open. Recovering himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he twisted his face into a grimace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, Senhor," said he. "You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, but what good does that do you now ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see how angry these people are. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">told them that you have put a spell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their beloved Memdoma. They believe he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is dying because of the evil you brought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this place, Senhor. I would not be in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">place for all the ivory in Africa! I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what you have gained."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naturally," Hurst answered imperturb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably. "I omitted to mention that one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistants wras detailed to watch your move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. His orders were to follow as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you left Ngomano with soldiers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fort Louis Filippe. You follow me, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers follow you. It is as simple as that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senhor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Soldiers!" Barahona's face worked. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand flew to his gun and I thought he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to shoot us on the spot. He changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind; strode up to Hurst and struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him full in the face. The pole prevented</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurst from falling over backwards; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sank to his knees. Barahona stood over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him raving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You lie!" he roared, dragging Hurst to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. "A trick! But you cannot fool me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the Saints, you are both dead men!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even soldiers will not save you." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted at the Intotelas and they prodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">us into motion. We left the village, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by grim-faced warriors and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shrill curses of the women ringing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our ears. The witch doctors leaped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieked in the van like fiends out of Hell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We crossed the river over stones green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slippery with weeds and stretched out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long file along a jungle path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At midnight we halted for an hour or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. Barahona came back from the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the line with the Intotela headmen. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in a group arguing. From the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">words I caught I got the impression that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barahona was trying to delay the march.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLOOD FOR THE JUJU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They met his proposals with vigorous head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking and angry exclamations. He came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to us and stood frowning down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have yourself to blame for this,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll get the truth from the Intotela</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they'll hang you for it, Barahona,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurst answered cooly. "You bad better</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barahona spat, cursed him and hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">away as the order to march was given.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We struggled on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the sun came up we followed a spruit</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a narrow ravine. The light was sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought out harshly the chalk-rock cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rose from one hundred to three hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet on either hand. Suddenly Hurst</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped as if something had struck him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the butt end of the yoke jolted up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against my chin, nearly knocking me out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, Buckland!" he shouted back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. "The temple!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE IT WAS, sure enough! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked as old as the cliffs themselves,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact it was part of them, carved out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the living rock. It had two stories with</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns, but was so dwarfed by its massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">background that it looked like a toy. Ero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sian had softened its carvings so that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to blend into the pastel shades of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sandstone. A pile of stone blocks, evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently what was left of a great stairway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spilled out of a black, square hole that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance. As we drew nearer to it, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a great, black slab of stone, set up like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an altar about fifty yards from the entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Facing the altar, but at some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it, the column of warriors was halted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The witch-doctors and the headmen gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered in a group apart. Then the drums be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to throb and the warriors rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to form a semi-circle before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">altar, all scrambling to get into the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank. Barahona, I noticed, with his Swa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilis clustered around him, had taken up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a position on the right horn of the semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle. I noticed also that the Swahilis had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been disarmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently we were led into the centre of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circle.

All</seg><seg type="columnLine">but two of the witch doctors retired, effac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing themselves in the crowd. Of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining, one stood by me; the other stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Hurst. He took off his mask, revealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a face withered and old. Then he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">chant, contorting his body and muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">until his eyes bulged and his lips were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flecked with foam. Fascinated, I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him work himself up while the resemblance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of man slipped from him like a cloak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he became the personification of bestial</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage. He had snatched a long curved knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">from under his grass cloak and was holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">it aloft with both hands for every one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see when the report of a rifle rang out. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell across Hurst on his face and, still un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to believe my eyes and ears, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood ooze from a hole in the back of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull. As I turned my head to look in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the temple, a figure came dash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward me. It was Kula! In the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment that I saw him, a rifle flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the pile of hewn stones. I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bullet plop into the black beside me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Kula was slashing at my bonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Run, Bwana!" he panted. "Run for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone house!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I POUNCED on the witch-doctor's knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cut the bonds from Hurst's legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Kula freed his hands. Shrieks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger and dismay, punctuated by the sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack of the rifle filled the canyon as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Intotela, over the first shock of surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped what was happening. We raced for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of the temple. As we clambered</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the heap of stones, Mahara jumped up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from among them. I took the rifle from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told her to follow the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we reached the temple, even at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment I was impressed by its mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificent proportions, and the amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor that must have gone into its construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Father Jerome wasn't lying," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurst enthusiastically.

"Rifles and ammunition are</seg><seg type="columnLine">cached inside, Buckland."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We went into the temple. The sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and a pace beyond the threshold it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as black as night.

"My</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders were to find this cache and destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I've never failed in a mission yet.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know1 how many rifles were there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The flickering light of a match showed tiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cases piled on a wooden platform to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the damp from them. We broke out a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rifles. I saw that we'd have to take them</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart and get the grease out of them. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to the doorway where it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">less painful to breath. It didn't take us long</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clean the rifles, but Hurst and I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to sacrifice our shirts. While we</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked, Kula told his tale. When Bwana</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurst had shot the snake, he said, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the blood had spattered his legs. An evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, the blood of a cobra. A man's legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">would shrivel up if it dried upon them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, he had gone down to the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wash it off. He had heard a shot and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">run back to the camp, saw what was hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening and hid himself. Later he had fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed us to Amatupa. Shortly after I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left him, two Intotela had caught him try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLOOD FOR THE JUJU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing- to leave the village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is easy for a man to get into a village</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a bundle of firewood," he concluded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But only a fool would carry wood out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a village.
