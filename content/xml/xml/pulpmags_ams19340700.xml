We might anticipate</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as being quite natural, except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their simplicity surpasses what we know</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mother Nature on this little ball of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, rock, water and detritus on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we live, support ourselves, or try to, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty effectually kill each other. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mussolini is accredited the statement</seg><seg type="columnLine">that war ennobles a nation. Much that</seg><seg type="columnLine">has occurred in recent years makes one</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt the accuracy of such a remark. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is merely a question of killing people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will find that it is taken excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of by the automobile, but no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinks that automobile deaths ennobles</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bode's law is an impressive example</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an utterly simple relation between the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">distances of the planets from the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It will be found stated in any good as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomy book. By taking a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of numbers starting with 1 or</seg><seg type="columnLine">unity, multiplying each by three and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then adding four to each we get another</seg><seg type="columnLine">series the numbers in which are ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximately proportional to the indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual distances from the sun of nur</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and of most of the other planets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeans notes the interesting fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the law was enunciated before the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery of the planet Uranus, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">asteroids and of Neptune. When these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were discovered, Uranus and the aste-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roids were found to fit excellently well</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Bode series. Neptune was obsti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nate and did not join the group except in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a poor approximation. The planet acts up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the personality of the ancient sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">deity of the Greek mythology, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Homer depicts as anything but an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting or well behaved character.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The name, asteroid, meaning star-like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">is obviously a poor one, planetoid is</seg><seg type="columnLine">often used and is better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In their motions around the sun, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets have for their path one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">simplest curves in mathematics--the el-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lipse. It is one of the conic sections and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the simplest of all three of them, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle is one limit of an ellipse with</seg><seg type="columnLine">both foci in one. The line taken as ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tending from a planet to the sun is called</seg><seg type="columnLine">its radius sector. It follows the plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ets which move in ellipses varies in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, and the planets vary in the rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their rotation so that their radius</seg><seg type="columnLine">vectors sweep over equal areas as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet goes through its elliptical orbit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It will be understood that the radius</seg><seg type="columnLine">vector of a planet always extends from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to only one focus of the elliptical</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit and therefore varies constantly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If we go on with this picturing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our inner consciousness the simplicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some things in our cosmos or solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system, as it is better to call it, we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to quite a curious thing. Suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">we draw all the planets in a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, each in relative size and solar dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, we will find if we draw two lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">one above and one below them, we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the section of a fusiform, or spindle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped solid pointed at or starting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun, swelling out to pass the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jupiter, and coming to a point in distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. (Sir James Jeans).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this section there is a gap or</seg><seg type="columnLine">space with a quantity of little planets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetoids they are properly called, aste-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roids is one incorrect name which has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been bestowed upon them. These move</seg><seg type="columnLine">through space like the planets, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">asteroid in its own orbit, around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. It is the many asteroids in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbits, that in stories of interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel, the space ships are supposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread. Nearly a thousand have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">identified and there are lots more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. One theory is that they are the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments of an exploded planet, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit lay between little Mars and gigan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic Jupiter. These little asteroids are</seg><seg type="columnLine">very well behaved and never come into</seg><seg type="columnLine">collision with the earth. The fusiform</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid within which the planets fit fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, some far too small for their posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, is taken to suggest a one time fila-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of -matter extending out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun and collapsing into the planets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our system. We may wonder whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the asteroids are spheroids or angular</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments of metal or rock. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem that space-ships could avoid them</seg><seg type="columnLine">by going north or south. But as yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are no space-ships to try it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes what is called a shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">star is seen to fly across the sky, a bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant path marking is course. This has</seg><seg type="columnLine">had assigned to it a rather poetical name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of meteor. The brilliant light is attrib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uted to friction with the atmosphere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our earth. It is hard to believe that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few seconds flight through the air should</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat a rock or a piece of iron alloy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">incandescence or could even cause it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst into violent explosion. Meteors do</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow with incandescence, they sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">explode like a bombshell--and there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to make them do it except fric-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with the air. It implies an almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">inconceivable velocity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before they are visible they may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">called meteoroids. Webster unhesitat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly accepts this name with its defini-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, although the term is little used. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor sometimes falls to earth, often</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursting into fragments, which scatter in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all directions. In the middle of last</seg><seg type="columnLine">March a meteor flew over Western Can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ada and burst with tremendous violence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking houses in central Alberta, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightening the people, who rushed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their dwellings in alarm. It is proposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to send out a searching party to secure</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the pieces. The authorities in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yale University believe that the fragments</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the earth not far from New</seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTEROIDS AND METEOROIDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Haven, Connecticut.

Most un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunately it was not adequately investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gated. There is no adequate record of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fall. It is supposed to have devastated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a considerable extent of country. Other</seg><seg type="columnLine">large meteorites are reported in Mexico.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Arizona there is a curious, crater-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like depression, 4,000 feet in diameter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and about 550 feet deep. It lies in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain and a wall of rock, over 100 feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in height surrounds it on its edge. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is attributed to the fall of an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorite, but the mass has never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, although it has been searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">for most thoroughly. Several tons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteoric iron alloy have been found in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its vicinity, but borings have failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach any great body of metal buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the mile-wide canyon with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred foot wall is due to a meteorite</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if the great Siberian devastated area</seg><seg type="columnLine">is due to one, they would seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">very terrifying visitants. Yet they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">spared human life. One which fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">near a laborer in England was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">step in the path, which led to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion that they came from outer space</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that "shooting stars" were meteor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ites heated to incandescence by friction</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the air. The paths of shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars, meteors they are properly termed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">must lie within the atmosphere, if fric-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with the air produces their heating.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This leads to the conjecture, for it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">little more, that they become luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a height of some seventy miles. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious thing about them is that the bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant incandescence affects only a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin layer of the surface, not over one</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-fifth of an inch in depth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a museum piece on public exhibi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, the largest meteorite is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Museum of Natural History in New</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">York. It was brought by the Arctic</seg><seg type="columnLine">explorer, Robert J. Peary, from Green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land on his trip.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esquimaux whose intercourse with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whalers and explorers had taught them</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of iron are said to have used</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of the meteorite for making spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads or other objects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The largest iron alloy meteorite which</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been discovered and adequately re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported as to dimensions and composition</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in Southern Africa.

This does not say that individuals</seg><seg type="columnLine">may not have seen it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is now a national monument and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presumably protected so as to be free</seg><seg type="columnLine">from injury. It is but fair to say that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is so hard that it cannot easily be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced which has operated to protect it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It has been attacked by some unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">person with a blast-lamp, whose action</seg><seg type="columnLine">has left traces on its surface. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly rectangular in its surfaces, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out projections of any importance. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">it lies thirteen people can stand upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">top or upper surface. It is about ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">by nine feet in horizontal area. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest thickness in a vertical direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion at one end is 122 centimeters, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little over four feet; at the other end</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is 75 centimeters or thirty inches thick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taking its specific gravity as 7.96 the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight figures out at nearly eighty tons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before it was incandescent it may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed ten per cent more. As it em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedded itself in the earth it is sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to have formed a layer of ferru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginous shale, which encases it partially</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a thickness of about twelve inches.

The specific gravity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth is approximately that of the iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorites--this gives a foundation for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belief that its core or central por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is mostly iron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are also meteorites of stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing comparatively little metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron.

We read of the earth col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liding with a comet, but no one knew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from any effect produced, on account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tenuousness of the substance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the celestial visitor. Another curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem concerns the size of meteors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is true that we have found upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, a number of them of considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions, as in the case of the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">African one just noted and of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peary meteorite, yet the belief holds that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are numbers of very small ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if these get heated to a sufficient</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">extent to a high enough temperature</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                      v&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                      o</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they will of course seem larger than they</seg><seg type="columnLine">really are. The filament of an electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp whose thickness is measured in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousandths of an inch seems quite large</seg><seg type="columnLine">when seen across a room, and the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect undoubtedly obtains in meteors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there are large ones, the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">African one is supposed to weigh about</seg><seg type="columnLine">200 tons and if the Arizona Canyon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by one it must have been an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous projectile. It has occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospectors that if there were such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor in the Arizona crater, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a very valuable property, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of drillings have been made in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes of finding it, but so far without</seg><seg type="columnLine">success. Some fragments were recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered in the drilling and around the site</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crater bits of the meteor have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been picked up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the great Siberian meteor compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively little is known; because of its dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance in the almost arctic wilderness it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was never investigated except after a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">interval and then it is probably fair to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, inadequately. The destruction in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding forest from its fall was said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have been felt for many miles and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot but hope that some time in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future a really adequate investigation will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made and perhaps the meteorite itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be discovered. We know that Pea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ry's meteorite with its smaller com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions, rested as far as we know, intact</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the Greenland shore, but we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet found out why the Arizona</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorite cannot be found, and as yet we</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not know what may be the results of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a further search in Siberia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Life Everlasting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          By DAVID H.

These twin</seg><seg type="columnLine">afflictions had stunted her body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">warped her mind; when she was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious of the struggle to breathe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was keenly aware of the fight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">earn the necessities of life. The dual</seg><seg type="columnLine">conflict left her no time for the finer</seg><seg type="columnLine">things of the world; fortunately, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only dimly aware of their existence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Days of work, with nights of respiratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">anguish, dulled her soul till she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one pleasant anticipation, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of an early death.

For years he had made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good living selling papers and smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his patrons.

He was a man with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady income and no occupation. John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones was his New York name.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced one-third of the dances, rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other two-thirds, and never gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostess more than one ticket.

The old man could not keep his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes off of her curves, but he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his myocardium could not stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strain and. besides, her English</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ackerman turned on the radio, passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the candy, cake and cigarettes, and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be the perfect host.

"All my life I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken Green Mountain Asthma Cure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lately adrenalin, and even morphine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and everything else that anyone ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised. They all helped for a while and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I was as bad off as ever. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, having to work for a living</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it hard for me. Perhaps your</seg><seg type="columnLine">medicine is the same as the rest, good</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-day and no good to-morrow, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly helped me to sleep, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning I feel strong and rested. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt this way all the time, I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount to something, might have cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age to try doing something different;</seg><seg type="columnLine">might even go to night school and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">an education. I read in the paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">once that, even if a woman was ugly, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped if she knew something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you are not ugly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed bitterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You must be blind.

It is a terrible thing to fight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">every breath, as I have had to do all</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life. I used to dream of being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird, flying high in the sky, yet, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough air left in me to sing; but al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways would come the waking and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">asthma.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps the dream will come true,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied the scientist.

I had lots of things to</seg><seg type="columnLine">write about, but never any time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I did have the time the strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lacking. Then my heart went bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">after influenza. The doctors tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be kind and lied to me at first.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper was being sold on the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of New York one hour before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed statement of the Governor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ohio was handed to the impatient re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porters surrounding the prison.

Half truths are worse than</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole lies and at once a tangled fiction</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread, especially through Ohio, as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what was going on at Farview</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prison. A Chicago paper, driven to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spair by the success of The Purple Flash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to publish a series of articles in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the direct charge was made that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ohio, forced to balance its budget, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimenting with a new form ot</seg><seg type="columnLine">euthanasia, whereby thousands of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">criminals, abnormals and defectives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rapidly die and thus relieve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">State of their financial care. The fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that many states were having difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in providing for their Welfare Depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments made this appear plausible.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a matter of waiting. The panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be opened some time. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like hours to Mansfield as he slouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">there; his knees were becoming numbed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he didn't dare move for fear that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be at that moment that the blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">would deem it the right time to open</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. His eyes were glued on the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl for some sign: her eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">centered upon the closed portal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just when he felt, that he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to change his position or drop, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flicker in the girl's face. She nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperceptibly, the hand behind her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked up and saw that a square</seg><seg type="columnLine">light was thrown against the wall. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now or never! Were he to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">this chance it was a foregone conclusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would never get another one. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a black mind wouldn't fall for this sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple trick twice in succession. Mansfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">had accomplished it once before, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">black knew of that. That unfortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow was now a dissolved thing some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where at the bottom of the circular pit in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which reposed the man-eating matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard a voice above him say:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look! The stranger has at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen into the pit! Good! The girl is</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched there yet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several voices broke into a gleeful</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheer in the ante-room. To Mansfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of those throats meant that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have to strike decisively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The element of surprise must not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost. All of them must not be given</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to coordinate their actions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw Venia nod again. An outline</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a blackish physiognomy shadowed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall and then the full head was thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, into the chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a flash of lightning his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved up and fixed themselves around</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that neck. A heave, and the body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half way through. Bands of steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed the breath from the negro. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at such a disadvantage that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't bring his arms into play, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus Mansfield held him, choking him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into submission. And the Englishman</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw, with a cheering glance, that so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he kept the fellow half-in and half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out it would be impossible to close the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A black face slipped closer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening; there was an upraised club and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venia moved in front of him and fired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He flopped backward into the remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing black who was right behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!" she cried. "They are down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Release him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield steadied himself and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">sail the fellow. A hoarse howl of horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">throated from him, but it was the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound he ever made. He bounced out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">view presently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield lifted the girl and tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her through the aperture, following with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bound that knocked him off his feet as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he alighted right atop the fallen blacks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Immediately he was clenched with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising negro who sunk his teeth into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear. Venia huddled against the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched entranced the flailing arms, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rippling muscles. Their freedom had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been enacted within such a brief inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">val that she was momentarily stunned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun hanging limply from her fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers. But a gasp fell from her lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she saw the huge paw of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly forcing back Mansfield's head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she plunged into them, pointing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle of the weapon at the hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, pulling the trigger. The negro's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head turned, his eyes wide open; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands relaxed; he dropped on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strange weapon, however, was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for the girl of Atlantis. The su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pernatural ease and manner with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it dealt with the enemy was not lost upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">38</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and awed her deeply. She fell back</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall, the revolver slipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her finger tips. Mansfield caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as it fell, his hand touching hers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was gratitude in his eyes. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft skin electrified him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next moment he had crushed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him and was kissing her milk-white</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow. She clung to him with her re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining strength, eagerly. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first manifestation of love Mansfield had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever shown to any bit of womanhood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it had not its origin then. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours of fearful ordeals had they suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered together; many moments of try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hardships. These had molded them</seg><seg type="columnLine">together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strangely enough, no blacks had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">plowing into the chamber after all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting and noise. But Mansfield saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the fellow Venia had first fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon was now returning to conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. He sat up and looked stupidly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two who stood over him, held a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a creased head from which blood was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping. He cowered at the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun pointed at his breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield stood looking at him. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">jubilant feeling came over him. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed fortunate that Venia hadn't killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fellow. He was injured enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be incapable of fighting but he was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming clear-minded to answer ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. And that was what was wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. From this black Mansfield could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out how to get out of the beastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He prodded him with the gun, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrifying motions, and the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed. Perspiration was pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his face, eyes were distended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you want to die?" the scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The huddling man shook his head vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently, shrinking still farther away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the thing which catapulted death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No!

But Mansfield jabbed the gun into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ribs with a suddenness that knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him against the wall. The crcature cried:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That way! That way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he pointed directly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel of the pit of doom!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John Mansfield's brow furrowed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, in wonder.

The voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking again!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Conduct the ritual of victory to Ra in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the holy chamber Yuxa."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield was angry. Decidedly an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gry! His blood cavorted madly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of that voice. What beastly right</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it to break him from the ecstatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of holding the daughter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high priest in his arms? It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of a confounded old rascal, that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it was! His mind tensed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unuttered desire. He'd find out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of that thing before many hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">were over! He'd drag it all over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor for the white men to see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of Ra was using them in ridiculous</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjection. Yes--he'd---- But, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it, that voice had spoken for ages!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was this?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YfUXA stood in reverent position for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, then quit the room. Venia</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the wall and opened a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of it, giving a wide view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bustling throng below. She leaned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him at her side. The men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women below caught a glimpse of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and burst into hailing cries. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms flung upward in commendatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestures, their throats yelling themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The figure of the high priest appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all became still. Soon there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steady flow into the temple, up to the »</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber of the supreme deity of -At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis, the god worshipped by the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient Egyptians, and later supplanted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faith of the men of Atlantis by</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ancient character, Cheops. The vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory ritual was a holy one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two stood next to each other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking down. Presently there were but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few left below, those on guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, Sir John. We must go now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chamber of Ra was a vast amphi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theater with a huge golden throne</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the dais. Mansfield, entering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room from a corner near the altar, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the time he had gone through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with Yuxa. And he distinctly remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered that the high priest had told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the delicately carved seat had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained any living person; that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the recipient of Ra at all times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The place was peculiarly quiet, for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the many people seated and yet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seated. All heads were held in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectful posture. Gone was the exuber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance manifested but a short time before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The religious ritual in the chamber of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great god was too holy a one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The high priest entered presently and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came quickly up the rugged aisle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the altar. He was now clad in a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment which brushed the floor, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head was bare. It was nothing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those religious displays of the blacks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a hideous and horrifying face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to affect and move the assembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield found himself sitting next</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Venia. on a small, backless bench in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of Yuxa and a short distance away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the golden throne, that dull, glis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tening thing which squatted near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrine. The Englishman concentrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gaze upon the seat of precious metal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chair into which no one had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped. The legs seemed rooted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor, strong and well-rounded. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne of Ra would find an open wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in any museum, he mused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voices about him broke into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, purring incantation of one pitch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a plea for righteous life, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reward after death; for happiness to</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue and to enter into their mode of</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence. It was a hearty and true ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression that came from them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant every word they said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT this was only the preliminary</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayer, he discovered. The real</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, the victory ritual, came later. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what an ear-splitting din it was! Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sense of the supposedly listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">god it was considered as a holy gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Every person rose to his feet and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the arms in a plea. The lungs took</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep breaths, the voices suddenly break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into a growing shriek that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued until all air was spent, following</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they abruptly sat down. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the victory ritual!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was all highly interesting to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist. He missed nothing, however</seg><seg type="columnLine">irrelevant it might appear. The victory</seg><seg type="columnLine">ritual to the god Ra had been offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">since time immemorial. The ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">Egyptians returned from a slain foe</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hailing cries. This, to which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just listened, was a perfect replica</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the one of thousands of years ago!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ra, to the Egyptians, was a combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the majesties studding the wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacious heaven. But to Atlantis the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning of the sun or moon was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">historical, something none had ever seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But those living knew, however, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">such did exist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield glanced around at the tap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estries for some symbol which might</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain the shape of Ra. Generally a</seg><seg type="columnLine">god was caricatured in some form or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion. But the garbed walls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare of anything to that effect. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the golden chair seemed symbolic of</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. There was some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">inscription upon the legs and arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, like a thunderclap, there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the assembly a noise like a cough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And another. Everybody sat immobile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectant. The voice spread over them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all heads bowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "High priest of Atlantis, your vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory ritual has reached the ears of Ra!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, for the first time in the history of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis, there shall be an ascendence</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the heaven! Seat the heroic stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the chair of Ra!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a sharp and breathless halt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield's heart was pounding. Venia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time in her life, broke away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the respectful bow which held her</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooping head and raised it frantically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at him. Her eyes were terror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized. Such a thing had never occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">before in the annals of the underground</seg><seg type="columnLine">land--the seating of anyone upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne of holiness, the seat of Ra! None</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what would be incurred by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">act. There was a fear which leaped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her beautiful eyes, an apprehension</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Englishman did not miss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John Mansfield's eyes were cloud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. Was this a trick of some sort?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps the blacks were behind this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they now saw their opportunity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing away with him! But no! How</seg><seg type="columnLine">could the ebony creatures have got</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with this farce for so many ages?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It hardly seemed possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YET, there was something here which</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced itself upon the white man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something that he ridiculed as not being</seg><seg type="columnLine">of supernatural and godly potency.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There couldn't be anything like that!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted badly to uncover it, and what</seg><seg type="columnLine">better time was to be had than now?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The solution lay within his grasp. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to sit down in that golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne and await the consequences.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something would probably happen. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he intended to solve it all. If there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were danger imminent, that contingency</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be met somehow. But right now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must go through with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a soothing shake of the head he</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmed the girl, and her tremulous coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenance turned from him to stare ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He rose to his feet, every head looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him unblinkingly, and moved toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throne. Standing before it for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he studied intently the construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but perceived nothing which might</seg><seg type="columnLine">arouse his suspicions. Everything ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared forward and innocent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down abruptly! A silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could have been cut with a knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">held everybody transfixed. But nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting in the seat was nothing ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">traordinary. It was similar to any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">repose. Hard and not any too comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. He glanced about him, observing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faces focused upon him. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice spoke again with finality, upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling, twitching nerves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look upon the courageous man, men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Atlantis! He goes now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield had no time to prepare</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself for what followed. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown back into the chair and he clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to the arms, as a sudden blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash enveloped the entire dais and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot where the chair was placed. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinging sensation smarted his eyes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began to cough. As though from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distance, he heard the scream of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl and knew that it was Venia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cloud hung thickly over him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstructing all vision. He shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to clear it. Suddenly he felt him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self rising swiftly! He knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair was going straight up with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his arms were leaning heavily on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the golden arms of the seat. His stom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ach felt hollow from the spurt up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was it really shooting into heaven?</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tried to ask himself in amazement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This soaring up and up, what was it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What unearthly power made it ascend?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It couldn't be supernatural, he told him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. He was a scientist, cold and pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">etrative. And that realization made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">shudder. He felt now that he had it!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was going to be smashed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone ceiling, flattened into a lifeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">form! That was it! Someone was go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to get rid of him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But nothing like that happened. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">head suddenly shot into a brilliant light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that relieved his smarting eyes, but daz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled him so that he couldn't see any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for a while. He stopped cough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and sputtering. Something tore him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the chair and threw him upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft bed, stunning him but momentarily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His. eyes gradually became used to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">light and he gazed around him. The in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensity of the illumination was thinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ERE!" A thin voice was speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to him. To his ringing ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">it sounded very much similar to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">raucous voice. He whirled, sprang to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There, sitting before a great table</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon which a luminous light fell in bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant lances, was a small wizened figure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose body was dried and thin. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hairless, his face accentuated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">high cheekbones, and the only thing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore was a metallic girdle of sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The figure radiated an aura of untold</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. Even as Mansfield looked fasci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natedly at him, he could feel those eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing the weight of many centuries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thin face bore the semblance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. Was this that heavenly entity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ra? And was this--was this heaven?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?" Mansfield demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a queer tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other pointed at the table before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and beckoned. "Come here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield strode over and gazed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flat top. It was some sort of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flector, lined off into sections. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked eagerly. The old man was point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to a square of large dimensions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiny dots were spotting the glass. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned a knob and the section leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into huge proportions. Staring back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield was a lucid picture of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber of Ra, the one he had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit forcibly!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Englishman saw the impassive</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces staring at the cloud which still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung around the altar, saw Venia stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing near her father with her hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamped over her mouth. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist cleared away and he could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden throne sitting there as it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always sat. And of course it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl stared at the great throne</seg><seg type="columnLine">with distorted eyes, then slumped for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, to be caught by the high priest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carried from the room. The ritual</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over. All filed out with heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jV/TANSFIELD whirled upon the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, who sat with orbs fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you? W'hat is this magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which you cower these men?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are staring at Ra-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield exclaimed, "Bosh! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">rascality are you up to here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spontaneous and impulsive stran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger never lost the whimsical smile on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emaciated face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are a clever man, Sir John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield.

You are overwrought."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Mansfield was not to be forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a seat. With demanding tone he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked again, "Who are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eyes of the old man stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him eagerly, looking right through him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You demand, Sir John. Are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">really interested ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield's breath was coming faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. He couldn't diagnose that creepy</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling which was quivering down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spine. He nodded his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those deep, awfully deep eyes smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. The bald head bent forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am Cheops!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Flame of Life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUITE a little while later, Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Mansfield fouiid himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting in a chair with mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">agape, staring unbelievingly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amused countenance of the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Cheops!

"He died five</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand years ago.

Had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to see his own face at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he would have been alarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its colorless pastiness. He couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut his mouth; it was ope^ wide enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stick two closed fists into it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't think straight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An old, bony arm extended toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

Mansfield took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep breath and glared around him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A burst of dismay, of utter wonder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from him. Right to the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was a transparent wall through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he could see the entire city of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis, and, down below, there issued</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the floor of the temple orderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">throngs of men and women. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the ones who had left the chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ra shortly before!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't understand this. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sat now was somewhere at the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the temple. Probably on the top.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he could look down and see every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. The glass was in clear view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those below. Yet not one of those heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">which occasionally glanced upward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the edifice ever showed sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise or notice of it. He, Mansfield,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken in every line of the temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had returned from the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">land beyond the man-eating plant, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was positive that there had been noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like this above the holy building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been a blank wall at this point--</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that he was sure. What miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was this?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">f I IS roving mind clicked back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow who called himself Cheops.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He surveyed him from head to foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He was the most shriveled, living</seg><seg type="columnLine">mummy he had ever seen.

Yet, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood the paradox!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He whispered awedly: "Tell me, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you call yourself Cheops?

The globe was girdled by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strip of metal the same as that of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two balls which floated, were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed. He could see that the orbits</seg><seg type="columnLine">were similar to those of the sun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, and that the earth turned once</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully to represent the passing of a day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three hundred and sixty-five turns in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one entire revolution designated a fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed year. That much Mansfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered from the man who called</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself Cheops. The instrument was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very ingenious piece!

And yet he wanted to believe this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man before him. That strange feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was rippling through him wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">without import.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was pliant as it had seldom if</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever been before; it was as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been dipped bodily into a mythical</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountain of youth, and had had every</seg><seg type="columnLine">care and worry peeled off with a moth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erly hand and touch!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His arms lifted with a flexibility that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a joy.

Only, as he gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the shrunken form, he saw what</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages of the flame did to the body.

There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a far-away look on her face.

Mansfield, observing with fascina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the squares before him, saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stationary dots suddenly flit around like</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies. There was a crazy movement on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reflector table. And looking out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invisible glass he saw men pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of their domiciles and lugging cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drical objects. Below, the portals of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple were gushing forth hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cheops roared, to no one in partic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular. "What fools they have been!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where were the guards?

Mansfield</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! The blacks have destroyed them!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those rays couldn't fail on their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">account! What blasted minded creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blacks are! Can't they realize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gray stuff eats black the same as</seg><seg type="columnLine">white? They are doomed, too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was clear now! That gray matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked fast, so fast that it would swal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low dozens of men before the rays could</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive it back. If there were two bodies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men on either side of it and both di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected their cylinders at it at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, it could be held stationary until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main rays were fixed again. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no great number of men, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, on the black habitat side, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a handful, and those without ray tubes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The horrible grisly essence would eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">through them. And once that fiendish</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter was uncontrollable, man here</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be doomed! Cheops was right!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield was activated. He wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do something, not to sit up here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch the white people's chances go</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimmering. He must get down there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and direct the fighting. Quickly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Cheops of his intentions. Cheops</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened, strode to get at the mouthpiece,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Mansfield grasped it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! Not that way! I must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">down there with them! I have to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a second the ancient ruler hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated, then acquiesced. Swiftly he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wall and pulled back a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever. Mansfield saw a trapdoor in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor open; something was coming up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it. It was the golden throne from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chamber of Ra. The chair was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hoisted into it by four long poles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, until the seat was half in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. He threw himself into it, held</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight to the arms, and the last sight he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had of Cheops was his face turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass walls as he hurriedly pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the lever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even before the golden throne had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the floor, he had tossed himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the rugged ground and was streaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the entrance. Out in the corridor a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few men were making mad dashes down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. Practically everybody had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raced speedily to the chamber of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high priest and found it empty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yuxa and Venia were somewhere below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without a moment's hesitation he flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward, pacing in large strides. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtook some laggards, left them far</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, paying no attention to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled glances at his presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out in the city he ran, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of the temple. Men were still mill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing onward. His eye swept the scene,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he grew angry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What fools they are! Why don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">they do this systematically? They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all rushing into its horrible jaws!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But hundreds of men had seen him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST Cm'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They pointed at him, gesticulated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a surprised array of faces. From some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where ahead, Mansfield saw a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcing itself back through the mob.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the men had got into the clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found that they were hurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him, yelling. It was Yuxa and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his official heads, the men of learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other dignitaries. And Venia</seg><seg type="columnLine">was with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield gave them no time to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">him questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get all the men lined up, quick!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Against the edge of the city. Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">them point their cylinders directly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground in front of them. Pay no</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the gray stuff. There must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a wall of rays packed tightly to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, so that not one inch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth can get through!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YUXA flashed the order. Venia came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his side and Mansfield held her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. looking into her face. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fear in her! a resolute mouth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave eyes. She had the utmost con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up ahead the yelling, frantic voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">had subsided somewhat and a more or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derly tone was to be perceived. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined up without a qualm now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw the emanation from their tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly before them. Rays were cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a broad front from every angle, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit no minute avenue of seepage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then several men scurried up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with panting breath from the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The blacks have broken a tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">through to the dungeons and are coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward. They are destroying every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The news left everybody agape. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man strength was needed to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deadly matter; there could be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention paid to the blacks. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crafty minds of the ebony creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">had figured that out. They had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rays mechanism to get the whites</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all up above. Then they had crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with their strategic blow!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But their strategy was awfully cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rect now', Mansfield told himself with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shudder! That man-eating wall needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most careful of attention. If dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted, the stuff would come right in</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them all! Those hideous blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't reason that far ahead!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND at the verification of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack from the rear, which came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shape of howling, demoniac ebon</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies swinging clubs and cylinders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a furor in the ranks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men. Many tore away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line which had been created to fight the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray matter, leaving gaping holes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish front. Into the oncoming black</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass they threw themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mansfield drew Venia clear back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelter of the temple walls. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice rose and fell, trying to assemble</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men once again, but his efforts fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">on deafened ears. Nobody heard him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everyone was busy protecting himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from black, swishing arms which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflicting terrible blows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was useless to stand here like this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he couldn't do anything else. Mans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field easily saw that doom was approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing swiftly for all. That seething, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulating mass of animal procreation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumbling on and on, closer and closer!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a hundred yards away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city's edge! A groan burst from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He whirled on the girl.

He was not going to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lease Venia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then a thought came to him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood erect, gazing into the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl. Why hadn't he thought of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">before? This place was doomed to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinction now. But there might be some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to save Venia and himself if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He asked quickly, "Where is the cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the flowing water?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl didn't understand. "Flow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing water?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waxed more anxious. "Is there</seg><seg type="columnLine">any chamber where there is water, lots</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it?

"Come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how do we get there?" Once more his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes swept the fray, which was growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilder and wilder, and once more he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that the mass of gray would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them with gorging intent in a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">while. Nothing, nothing could be done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was there but once in my life, Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that it was one of the magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicles. They rushed into the car and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the door, just as a huge black</seg><seg type="columnLine">came bounding upon the platform after</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                                             - -p- - ■ \</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">r T IS club crashed against the closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and knocked it half open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in the split interim Venia had waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand over the glowing tube and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car moved away with a jerk, between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the large circular rings. The black</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled on the edge of the platform,</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't regain his equilibrium and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">head foremost down on the road-bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the carrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why do you want to go to the flow-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing water below? It is a nice place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to conceal ourselves, but we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be found in the end." The girl was</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at him queerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew what she was thinking. He,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strong man who performed miracles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was running away and hiding! But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed, causing the beautiful eyes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise in question.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked backward, toward the land which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reared her, and her eyes welled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was clear to her now. If Sir John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mansfield said that Atlantis was doomed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was conclusive.

Suddenly they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown against the wall as it stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly, permitting another car to pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">their front. The intersection showed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle ahead which was packed full with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocious blacks quarreling among them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves.

Mansfield fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the edge and peered over, but saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing other than the moving water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The walls were bare and solid. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">only opening was the one they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come through.

His heart sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the thought that he might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">duped by the emaciated old fellow. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber wasn't an outlet, but as perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trap as could be gotten into.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you sure there is no other cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber where there is water?" he asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head.

His hody fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swirling, swishing water, knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if something did not happen soon, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be all over with him.

Some of the party are at the beginning of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the line which is to be measured and are awaiting the arrival of a steamboat carrying much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of their equipment and other members, which at last comes up the river. The boat is made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to be knocked down, so that it can he put in pieces upon ox wagons and be taken from river</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to river or lake. We are told of the different attempts to measure a meridian, the details of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which are of much interest as presented by our author. Especially does he mention the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">meridian from the Balearic Islands to Dunkirk on the British Channel. This we are told is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">especially interesting because its termini are so located that the slight departure of the earth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from true sphericity is automatically corrected. One of the party, Sir John, is a great hunter,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and we are told of his successes among the great forms of African game, and we are to hear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more about it in the latter part of the story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    The party being bi-national--some Russian, some English--and the impending Crimean</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">War does not improve their relations.

During the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning the sky becamc covcred with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister-looking clouds, piled together</seg><seg type="columnLine">like bales of down of contrasted colors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yellowish hue distinctly relieving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of dark gray. The sun was wan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heat was overpowering, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barometer fell rapidly; the air was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">still that not a leaf fluttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although the astronomers had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been unconscious of the change of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather, they had not thought it neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to suspend their labors. Emery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">attended by two sailors and four natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">in charge of a wagon, was sent two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles east of the meridian to establish</seg><seg type="columnLine">a post for the vertex of the next tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle. He was occupied in securing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his point of sight, when a current of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold air caused a rapid condensation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which appeared to contribute immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a development of electric matter. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly there fell a violent shower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hail, and by a rare phenomenon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hailstones were luminous, so that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be raining drops of boiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver. The storm increased; sparks</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed from the ground and jets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light gleamed from the iron settings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wagon. Dr. Livingstone relates that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has seen tiles broken, and horses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">antelopes killed, by the violence of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">hail-storms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without losing a moment, Emery left</seg><seg type="columnLine">his work for the purpose of calling his</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">men to the wagon, which would afford</seg><seg type="columnLine">better shelter than a tree. But he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly left the top of the hill, when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazzling flash, instantly followed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peal of thunder, inflamed the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Emery was thrown down, and lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">prostrate, as though he was actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. The two sailors, dazzled for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, were not long in rushing to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward him, and were relieved to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the thunderbolt had spared him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been enveloped by the fluid, which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">collected by the compass which he held</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand, had been diverted in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, so as to leave him not seriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">injured. Raised by the sailors, he soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to himself; but he had narrowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped. Two natives, twenty paces</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart, lay lifeless at the foot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">post. One had been struck by the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of the thunderbolt, and was a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shattered corpse, while his clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained entire; the other had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">locally struck on the skull by the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structive fluid, and had been killed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. The three men had been un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deniably struck by a single flash. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">trisection of a flash of lightning is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual but not unknown occurrence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the angular division was very large.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Bochjesmen were at first over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed by the sudden death of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrades, but soon, in spite of the cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sailors and at the risk of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck themselves, they rushed back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp. The two sailors, having first</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided for the protection of Emery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyed the two dead bodies to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon, and then found shelter for</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, being sorely bruised by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hailstones, which fell like a shower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">marbles. For three-quarters of an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm continued to rage; the hail</seg><seg type="columnLine">then abated so as to allow the wagon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The news of the death of the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">had preceded them, and had produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deplorable effect on the minds of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bochjes nen, who already looked upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trigonometrical operations with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror of superstition. They assembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in secret council, and some more timid</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the rest declared they would go no</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther. The rebellious disposition be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to look serious, and it took all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman's influence to arrest an actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolt. Colonel Everest offered the poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">men an increase of pay; but content-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was not to be restored without</seg><seg type="columnLine">much trouble. It was a matter of emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gency ; had the natives deserted, the posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the caravan, without escort and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without drivers, would have been peril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous in the extreme. At length, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difficulty was overcome, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burial of the natives, the camp was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised, and the little troop proceeded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hill where the two had met their</seg><seg type="columnLine">death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Emery felt the shock for some days;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left hand, which had held the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass, was almost paralyzed; but after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it recovered, and he was able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">resume his work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For eighteen days no special incident</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred. The Makololos did not ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear, and Mokoum, though still distrust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, exhibited fewer indications of alarm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were not more than fifty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the desert; and the karroo was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">verdant, and enriched by abundant water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They thought that neither man nor beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">could want for anything in this region</seg><seg type="columnLine">so rich in game and pasturage; but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reckoned without the locusts, against</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose appearance there is no security in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agricultural districts of South Africa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the evening of the 20th, about an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour before sunset, the camp was ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged for the night. A light north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erly breeze refreshed the atmosphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The three Englishmen and Mokoum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting at the foot of a tree, discussed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their plans for the future. It was ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged that during the night the astron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">omers should take the altitude of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stars, in order accurately to find their</seg><seg type="columnLine">latitude. Every thing seemed favorable</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the operations; in a cloudless sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon was nearly new, and the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellations might be expected to be clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and resplendent. Great was the disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointment, therefore, when Emery, ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and pointing to the north, said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The horizon is overcast; I begin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear our anticipations of a fine night will</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly be verified."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," replied Sir John, "I see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud is rising, and if the wind should</seg><seg type="columnLine">freshen, it might overspread the sky."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is not another storm coming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hope," interposed the Colonel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are in the tropics," said Emery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and it would not be surprising; for to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night I begin to have misgivings about</seg><seg type="columnLine">our observations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is your opinion, Mokoum?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the Colonel of the bushman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mokoum looked attentively toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north. The cloud was bounded by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long clear curve, as definite as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced by a pair of compasses. It marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">off a section of some miles on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon, and its appearance, black as</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke, seemed to excite apprehensions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bushman. At times it reflected a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reddish light from the setting sun, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it were rather a solid mass than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any collection of vapor. Without direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply to the Colonel's appeal, Mokoum</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply said that it was strange.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes one of the Bochjes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men announced that the horses and cat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle showed signs of agitation, and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be driven to the interior of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, let them stay outside," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mokoum; and in answer to the sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion that there would be danger from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild beasts around, he added sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificantly, "Oh, the wild beasts will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much occupied to pay any attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">After the native had gone back, Colo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nel Everest turned to ask what the bush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man meant; but he had moved away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was absorbed in watching the advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cloud, of which, too accurately, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aware of the origin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dark mass approached. It hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">low and appeared to be but a few hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet from the ground. Mingling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sound of the wind was heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar rustling, which seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceed from the cloud itself. At this</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, above the cloud against the sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared thousands of black specks, flut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering up and down, plunging in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and breaking the distinctness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are those moving specks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black?" asked Sir John.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are vultures, eagles, falcons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kites," answered Mokoum, "from</seg><seg type="columnLine">afar they have followed the cloud, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">will never leave it until it is destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">or dispersed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the cloud?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is not a cloud at all," answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman, extending his hand toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">somber mass, which by this time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread over a quarter of the sky. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a living host; to say the truth, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a swarm of locusts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hunter was not mistaken. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europeans were about to witness one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those terrible invasions of grass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoppers, which are unhappily too fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent, and in one night change the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">fertile country into an arid desert. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">locusts, now arriving by millions, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dread schistocerca of the naturalists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and travelers have seen for a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fifty miles the beach covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">piles of these insects to the height of</seg><seg type="columnLine">four feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," continued the bushman, "these</seg><seg type="columnLine">living clouds are a true scourge to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, and it will be lucky if we es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape without harm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we have no crops and pasturages</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of our own," said the Colonel; "what</seg><seg type="columnLine">have we to fear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing, if they merely pass over</seg><seg type="columnLine">our heads; everything if they settle on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country over which we must travel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They will not leave a leaf on the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor a blade of grass on the ground;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you forget, Colonel, that if our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own sustenance is secure, that of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals is not.

In an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant the enormous cloud which over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowed them settled on the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing could be seen as far as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon but the thickening mass. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp was bestrewed; wagons and tents</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike were veiled beneath the living hail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Englishmen, moving knee-deep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insects, crushed them by hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">at every step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although there was 110 lack of agen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cies at work for their destruction, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">aggregate defied all check. The birds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hoarse cries, darted down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, and devoured them greedily; from</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, the snakes consumed them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous quantities; the horses, buffa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loes, mules and dogs fed on them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">great relish, and lions and hyenas, ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phants and rhinoceroses swallowed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by bushels. The very Bochjes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men welcomed these "shrimps of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">air" like celestial manna; the insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">even preyed on each other, but their</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers still resisted all sources of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bushman entreated the English to</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste the dainty. Thousands of young</seg><seg type="columnLine">locusts, of a green color, an inch to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch and a half long, and about as thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a quill, were caught. Before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have deposited their eggs, they are con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered a great delicacy by connoisseurs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and are more tender than the old insects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which are of a yellowish tinge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes measure some inches in length.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a half an hour's boiling, and sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soning with salt, pepper and vinegar, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushmen served up a tempting dish to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three Englishmen. The insects, dismem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered of head, legs and skin, were eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">just like shrimps, and were found ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely savory. Sir John, who ate some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds, recommended his people to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take advantage of the opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a large provision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At night they were all about to seek</seg><seg type="columnLine">their usual beds; but the interior of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagons had not escaped the invasion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was impossible to enter without crush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the locusts, and to sleep under such</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions was not an agreeable pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect. Accordingly as the night was clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the stars bright, the astronomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rejoiced to pursue their contem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plated operations, and deemed it more</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant than burying themselves to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck under a coverlet of locusts. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, they would not have had a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's sleep, on account of the howling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beasts which were attracted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their unusual prey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day the sun rose in a clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon, and commenced its course over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brilliant sky foreboding heat. A dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustling of wings among the locusts</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that they were about to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">their devastations elsewhere; and toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight o'clock the mass rose like the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">furling of an immense veil, and obsured</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun. It grew dusk as if night were</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning, and with the freshening of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind the whole inass was in motion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For two hours, with a deafening noise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cloud passed over the darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, and disappeared beyond the west-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After their departure the bushman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">predictions were found to be entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized. All was demolished, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil was brown and bare. Every branch</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stripped to utter nakedness. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a sudden winter settling in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of summer, or like the dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a desert into the midst of a land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty. The Oriental proverb which</seg><seg type="columnLine">describes the devastating fury of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Osmanlis might justly be applied to</seg><seg type="columnLine">these locusts, "Where the Turk has</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed the grass springs up no more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Desertion and Reunion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was indeed no better than a desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">which now lay before the travel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel and his companions thus had</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite hopes, and were inspirited to</seg><seg type="columnLine">persevere. But the hired Bochjesmen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who knew nothing of any scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">ardor, and who had been long ago re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luctant to pursue their journey, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly be encouraged to hold out; un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">questionably they suffered greatly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were objects for commiseration. Already,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, some beasts of burden, overcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">by hard work and scanty food, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">left behind, and it was to be feared that</seg><seg type="columnLine">more would fall into the same helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition. Mokoum had a difficult task</seg><seg type="columnLine">to perform, and as murmurs and recrim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inations increased, his influence more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more lost its weight. It became ev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ident that the want of water would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious obstacle, and that the expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion must either retrace its steps, or, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the risk of meeting the Russians, turn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right of the meridian, to seek some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the villages which were known to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered along Livingstone's route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not long, however, before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman one morning came to the Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onel, and declared himself powerless</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the increasing difficulties. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">drivers, he said, refused to obey him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were continued scenes of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">subordination, in which all the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined. The Colonel perfectly well un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood the situation; but stern to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, he was stern to others. He refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suspend his operations, and declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that although he went alone, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue to advance. His two compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions of course agreed, and professed</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves ready to follow him. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">newed efforts of Mokoum persuaded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives to venture a little further: he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt sure that the caravan could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than five or six days' march from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lake Ngami, and once there, the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imals could find pasturage and shade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the men an abundance of fresh wa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. All these considerations he laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the principal Bochjesmen. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed them that it was really best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance northward. If they turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west, their march would be perilous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to turn back was only to find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">karroo desolate and dry. The natives at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length yielded to his solicitations, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the almost exhausted caravan continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">its course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Happily this vast plain was in itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorable to all astronomical observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, so that no delay arose from any</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural obstruction. On one occasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">there sprang up a sudden hope that na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture was about to restore to them a sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply of the water of which she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so niggardly. A lagoon, a mile or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">in extent, was discovered on the horizon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The reflection was indubitably of water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">proving that what they saw was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirage, due to the unequal density of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmospheric strata. The caravan speed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily turned in that direction, and the la-</seg><seg type="columnLine">goon was reached toward five in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening. Some of the horses broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from their drivers, and galloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the longed-for water. Having smelt</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, they plunged in to their chests, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost immediately returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. They had not drunk, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Bochjesmen arrived they found</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves by the side of the lagoon so</seg><seg type="columnLine">impregnated with salt that its water</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be touched. Disappointment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was keen, it was little short of despair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mokoum thought that he should never</seg><seg type="columnLine">induce the natives to proceed; but for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately the only hope was in advancing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even the natives were alive to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conviction that Lake Ngami was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest point where water could be pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured. In four days, unless retarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by its labors, the expedition must reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shores of the lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every day was momentous. To econ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">omize time, Colonel Everest formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger triangles and established fewer</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">posts. No efforts were spared to hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the progress of the survey. Notwith-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing the application of every energy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the painful sojourn in the desert was</seg><seg type="columnLine">prolonged, and it was not until the 21st</seg><seg type="columnLine">of February that the level ground be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to be rough and undulating. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain 500 or 600 feet high was</seg><seg type="columnLine">descried about fifteen miles to the north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">west. The bushmen recognized it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mount Scorzef, and, pointing to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north, said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lake Ngami is there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Ngami! the Ngami!" echoed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives, with noisy demonstration. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to hurry on in advance over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen miles, but Mokoum restrained</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, asserting that the country was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fested by Makololos, and that it was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant to keep together. Colonel Ev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erest, himself eager to reach the lake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolved to connect by a single triangle</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station he was now occupying with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mount Scorzef. The instruments were</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore arranged, and the angle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last triangle which had been already</seg><seg type="columnLine">measured from the south was measured</seg><seg type="columnLine">again from the station. Mokoum, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatience, only established a temporary</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp; he hoped to reach the lake before</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, but he neglected none of his usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">precautions, and prudently sent out</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsemen, right and left, to explore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">underwood. Since the oryx-chase the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Makololos seemed indeed to have aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doned their watch, still he would not in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cur any risk of being taken by surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus carefully guarded by the bush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, the astronomers constructed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangle. According to Emery's calcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lations it would carry them nearly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentieth parallel, the proposed limit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arc. A few more triangles on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side of Lake Ngami would com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete their eighth degree; to verify the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations, a new base would subse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently be measured directly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, and the great enterprise would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be ended. The ardor of the astron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">omers increased as they approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">completion of their task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile there was considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity as to what the Russians on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their side had accomplished. For six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months the members of the commission</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been separated, and it seemed pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bahle to the English that the Russians</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not suffered so much from heat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirst, since their course had lain near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er Livingtone's route, and therefore in</seg><seg type="columnLine">less arid regions. After leaving Kolo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beng they would come across various</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages to the right of their meridian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they could easily revictual their</seg><seg type="columnLine">caravan. But still it was not unlikely</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in this less arid, though more fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quented country, Mathew Strux's little</seg><seg type="columnLine">band had been more exposed to the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack of the plundering Makololos, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was the more probable, since they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have abandoned the pursuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the English caravan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although the Colonel, ever engrossed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no thought to bestow on these</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, Sir John and Emery had often</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussed the doings of their former</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrades. They wondered whether they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come across them again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether they would find that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained the same mathematical result</seg><seg type="columnLine">as themselves, and whether the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">computations of a degree in South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Africa would be identical. Emery did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not cease to entertain kind memories</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his friend, knowing well that Zorn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his part, would never forget him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The measurement of the angles was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now resumed. To obtain the angle at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station they now occupied, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to observe two points of sight. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these was formed by the conical sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit of Mount Scorzef, and the other by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp peak three or four miles to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left of the meridian, whose direction was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily obtained by one of the telescopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the repeating circle. Mount Scorzef</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was much more distant; its position</seg><seg type="columnLine">would compel the observers to diverge</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerably to the right of the meridian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but on examination they found they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other choice. The station was there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore observed with the second telescope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the repeating circle, and the angular</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance between Mount Scorzef and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller peak was obtained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Notwithstanding the impatience of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives, Colonel Everest, as calmly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he were in his own observatory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made many successive registries from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the graduated circle of his telescope, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, by taking the average of all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">readings, he obtained a result rigorously</seg><seg type="columnLine">exact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day glided on, and it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the darkness prevented the reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the instruments, that the Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought his observations to an end, say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' "I am at your orders, Mokoum; we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will start as soon as you like."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And none too soon," replied Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">koum ; "better had we accomplished our</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey by daylight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The proposal to start met with unani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous approval, and by seven o'clock the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirsty party were once more on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">march.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Some strange foreboding seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighing on the mind of Mokoum, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he urged the three Europeans to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully to their rifles and to be well</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided with ammunition. The night</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew dark, the moon and stars were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peatedly veiled in mist, but the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere near the ground was clear. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman's keen vision was ever watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the flanks and front of the caravan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his unwonted disquietude could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail to be noticed by Sir John, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">likewise on the watch. They toiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the weary evening, occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopping to gather together the loiterers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at ten o'clock they were still six</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from the lake. The animals gasped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for breath in an atmosphere so dry that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hygrometer could not have detected</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trace of moisture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mokoum was indefatigable in his en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavors to keep the disorganized party</seg><seg type="columnLine">close together; but, in spite of his rem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onstrances, the caravan no longer pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented a compact nucleus. Men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts stretched out into a long file, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some oxen had sunk exhausted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. The dismounted horsemen could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly drag themselves along, and any</seg><seg type="columnLine">stragglers could have been easily carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">off by the smallest band of natives. Mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">koum went in evident anxiety from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another, and with word and gestures</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to rally the troop, and already,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without his knowledge, some of his men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were missing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By eleven o'clock the foremost wag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ons were hardly more than three miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their destination. In the gloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of night Mount Scorzef stood out dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly in its solitary height, like an enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous pyramid, and the obscurity made</seg><seg type="columnLine">its dimensions appear greater than they</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually were. Unless Mokoum were</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken, Lake Ngami lay just behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mount Scorzef, so that the caravan must</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass round its base in order to reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tract of fresh water by the shortest</seg><seg type="columnLine">route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bushmen, in company with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three Europeans, took the lead, and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to turn to the left, when suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">some distinct, though distant report, ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested their attention. They reined in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their horses, and listened with a natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety. In a country where the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">use only assegais* and bows and ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows the report of European firearms</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rather startling. The Colonel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir John simultaneously asked the bush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man from whence the sound could pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceed. Mokoum asserted that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceive a light in the shadow at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">summit of Mount Scorzef, and that he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  'An assegai is a light spear used for throwing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as in close comhat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had no doubt that the Makololos were</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacking a party of Europeans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Europeans!" cried Emery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," replied Mokoum; "these re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports can only be produced by European</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what Europeans could they be?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">began Sir John. "Be who they may,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke in the Colonel, "we must go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their assistance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; come on," said Emery, with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">little excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before starting off for the mountain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mokoum, for the last time, tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rally the small band. But when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman turned round the caravan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispersed, the horses were unyoked, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagons forsaken, and a few scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows were flying along the plain to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The cowards!" he cried; then turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the English he said, "Well, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must go on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Englishmen and the bushman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering up all the remaining strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their horses, rode on to the north.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After awhile they could plainly distin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guish the war-cry of the Makololos.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever was their number, it was ev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ident they were making an attack on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mount Scorzef, from the summit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which flashes of fire continued. Groups</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men could be faintly distinguished as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cending the sides. Soon the Colonel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companions were on the rear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the besiegers. Abandoning their worn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out steeds, and shouting loud enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be heard by the besieged, they fired at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mass of natives. The rapidity with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they reloaded caused the Mako-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lolos to imagine themselves assailed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large troop. The sudden attack sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised them, and letting fly a shower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows and assegais, they retreated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without losing a moment, the Colonel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir John, Emery, Mokoum and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors, never desisting from firing, at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked the group of natives, of whose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies no less than fifteen soon strewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Makololos divided. The Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peans rushed into the gap, and overpow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering the foremost, ascended the slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward. In a few minutes they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the summit, which was now en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely in darkness, the besieged having</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended their fire for fear of injuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who had come so opportunely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their aid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were the Russian astronomers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strux, Palander, Zorn, and their five</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors, all were there: but of all the na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives belonging to their caravan there</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained but the faithful pioneer.

Each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meridians crossed the lake, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite shores it was necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unite trigonometrically by a large tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle.

After leaving Kolo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beng, the Russian party had continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">without irregularity. The old meridian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had fallen by lot to the Rus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sians, crossed a fertile and slightly un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulated country, which offered every</seg><seg type="columnLine">facility for the triangulation. Like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">English, they had suffered from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat, but they had experienced no hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship from the want of water. Streams</seg><seg type="columnLine">were abundant, and kept up a wholesome</seg><seg type="columnLine">moisture. The horses and oxen had</seg><seg type="columnLine">roamed over an immense pasturage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">across verdant prairies broken by forests</seg><seg type="columnLine">and underwood. The wild animals by</seg><seg type="columnLine">night had been safely kept at a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">by sentinels and fires, nor had any na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives been seen except those stationary</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the villages in which Dr. Livingstone</seg><seg type="columnLine">had always found a hospitable recep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. All through the journey the Boch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jesmen of the caravan had given no</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause for complaint, nor was it until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous day, when the Makololos to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of 200 or 300 had appeared on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plain, that they had shown them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves faithless and had deserted. For</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-six hours the expedition had now</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied the little fortress.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Makololos had attacked them in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening, after plundering the wagons</seg><seg type="columnLine">left at the foot of the hill. The instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments fortunately, having been carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the fort, were secure. The steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat had also escaped the ravages of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives; it had been immediately put</seg><seg type="columnLine">together by the sailors, and was now at</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchor in a little creek of Lake Ngami,</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the enormous rocks that formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the mountain. Mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scorzef sloped with sudden abruptness</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the lake, and there was no dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger of an attack from that side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such was Matthew Strux's account.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel Everest, in his turn, related the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incidents of his march, the fatigues and</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulties, and the revolt of the Boch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jesmen, and it was found by comparison</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Russians had had a less harass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing journey than had their rivals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night of the 21st passed quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Makoum and the sailors kept watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the walls for the fort; the Mako-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lolos on their part did not renew their</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack, but the bivouac-fires at the foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mountain proved that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not relinquished their project. At day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">break the Europeans left their casemate</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the purpose of reconnoitering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain. The early morning light illumin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated the vast extent of country as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon. Toward the south lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert, with its burnt brown grass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">barren aspect. Close under the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain was the circular camp, containing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a party of 400 or 500 natives. The fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still alight, and some pieces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">game were broiling on the hot embers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The encampment was something more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than temporary; the Makololos were</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently determined not to abandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their prey. Either vengeance or an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctive thirst for blood appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompting them, since all the valuables</seg><seg type="columnLine">of both caravans, the wagons, horses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">oxen, and provisions had fallen into</seg><seg type="columnLine">their power; or perhaps it might be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they coveted the firearms which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europeans carried, and 1 of which such</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible use has been made. The united</seg><seg type="columnLine">English and Russians held a long con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sultation with the bushman, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that they could not relax their</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch until they should arrive at some</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite decision. This decision must de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pend on a variety of circumstances, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">first of all it was necessary to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly the position of Mount Scorzcf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The mountain overlooked to the south,</seg><seg type="columnLine">east, and west the vast desert which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers, having traversed it, knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended southwards to the karroo. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west could be discerned the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlines of the hills bordering the fer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tile country of the Makololos, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose capitals, Maketo, lies about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred miles northwest of Lake Ngami.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the north the mountain commanded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">country which was a great contrast to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arid steppes of the south. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were water, trees, and pasturage. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred miles east and west lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long Lake Ngami, while from north to</seg><seg type="columnLine">south its width was not more than 30</seg><seg type="columnLine">to 40 miles. Beyond appeared a gentle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">undulated country, enriched with forests</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watered by the affluents of the Zam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">besi, and shut in to the extreme north</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a low chain of mountains. This wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">oasis was caused by the great artery, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zambesi, which is to South Africa what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Danube is to Europe, or the Amazon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to South America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The side of the mountain toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake, steep as it was, was not so steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that the sailors could accomplish an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascent and descent by a narrow way</seg><seg type="columnLine">which passed from point to point. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus contrived to reach the spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Queen and Csar lay hid, and, obtain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a supply of water, enabled the lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle garrison to hold out in the deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort as long as their provisions lasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The astronomers wondered w-hy this</seg><seg type="columnLine">little fort had been placed on the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain. Mokoum, who had vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited the country as Livingstone's guide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained that formerly the neighbor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood of Lake Ngami was frequented by</seg><seg type="columnLine">traders in ivory and ebony. The ivory</seg><seg type="columnLine">was furnished by the elephants and rhin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osceroses; but the ebony trade was but</seg><seg type="columnLine">too often another name for that traffic in</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings which is still carried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the slave-traders in the region of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zambesi. A great number of prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">are made in the wars and pillages in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior of the country, and these pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oners are sold as slaves. Mount Scor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zef had been a center of encampment for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ivory-traders, and it was there that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been accustomed to rest before</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending the Zambesi. They had for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tified their position to protect themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their slaves from depredations, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not an uncommon occurrence for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoners to be recaptured for fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">sale by the very men who had recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">sold them. The route of the traders was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now changed; they no longer passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shores of the lake, and the little fort</seg><seg type="columnLine">was falling into ruins. All that remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an inclosure in the form of the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor of a circle, from the center of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose a small casemated redoubt, pierced</seg><seg type="columnLine">with loop-holes, and surmounted by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small wooden turrent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But notwithstanding the condition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruin into which it had fallen, the fortress</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered the Europeans a welcome re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat. Behind the thick sandstone wralls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and armed with their rapid-firing guns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were confident that they could keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">back an army of Makololos, and unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">their provisions and ammunition failed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would be able to complete their ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servations. At present they had plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ammunition; the coffer in which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was contained had been placed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same wagon which carried the steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, and had therefore escaped the ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pacity of the natives. The great diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty would be the possible failure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">provisions. The Colonel and Strux made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a careful inspection of the store;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found that there was only enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">last the eighteen men for two days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a short breakfast the astronomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bushman, Makoum, leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors still to keep watch around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, assembled in the redoubt to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuss their situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I cannot understand," said Mokoum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"why you are so uneasy. You say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have only provisions for two days;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but why stay here? Let us leave to-mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, or even to-day. The Makololos</seg><seg type="columnLine">need not hinder us; they could not cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake, and in the steamboat we may</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the northern shore in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The astronomers looked at each other;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea, natural as it was, had not struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">them before.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have fixed on a peak in the extreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">northeast, so that the side of the tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle will cross the lake obliquely."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," said the Colonel, "if the peak</seg><seg type="columnLine">exists, I do not see any difficulty."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The only difficulty," replied Strux,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"consists in the distance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the distance?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Over a hundred miles, and a lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal must be carried to the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Assuredly that can be done," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Colonel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And all that time, how are we to</seg><seg type="columnLine">defend ourselves against the Makololos ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the bushman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will manage that, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mokoum said that he would obey the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel's orders, and the conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended. The whole party left the case-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate, and Strux pointed out the peak he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had chosen. It was the conical peak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Volquiria, 2,000 feet high, and just</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible in the horizon. Notwithstand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the distance, a powerful reflector</seg><seg type="columnLine">could thence be discerned by means of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnifying telescope, and the curvature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth's surface, which Strux had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken into account, would not be any</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstacle. The real difficulty was how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lamp should be carried to the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain. The angle made at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mount Scorzef with Mount Volquiria</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the preceding station would com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete the measure of the meridian, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the operation was all important.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zorn and Emery offered to take this</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey of a hundred miles in an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known country, and, accompanied by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pioneer, prepared to start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the canoes which are manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factured by the natives with great dex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terity, would be sufficient to carry them</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the lake.

From time to time, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, recognizable by the richness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skins which he wore, ascended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope of the mountain and tried to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amine the approaches to the summit; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the report of a rifle always took him</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily back to the plain. The Mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ololos then raised their war-cry, bran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dished their assegais, and all became</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following day the natives made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a more serious attempt, and about fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them at once scaled three sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain. The whole garrison turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to the foot of the enclosure, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">European arms caused considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravage among the Makololos. Five or</seg><seg type="columnLine">six were killed, and the rest abandoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">their project, but it was quite evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if several hundred were to assault</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain simultaneously, the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sieged would find it difficult to face them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all sides. Sir John now thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mitrailleuse, which was the principal</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon of the Queen and Czar, and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed that it should be brought up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">defend the front of the fortress. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a difficult task to carry the machine up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks, which in some parts were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most perpendicular; but the sailors</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed themselves so agile and daring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in the course of the day the mit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">railleuse was installed in the embrasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the embattled enclosure. Thence, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five muzzles, arranged in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape of a fan, would cover the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fort, and the natives would thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">early make the acquaintance with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine of death which in after years was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to effect such devastation among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized armies of the European con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dry air and clear sky had enabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the astronomers each night to pursue</seg><seg type="columnLine">their observation. They had found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latitude of Mount Scorzef to be 19°,</seg><seg type="columnLine">37', which result confirmed their opinion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were less than half a degree</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the northern extremity of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">meridian, and that consequently the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangle would complete the series.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night passed without any fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm. If circumstances had favored the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pioneer, he and his companions would</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach Mount Volquiria the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, so that the astronomers kept un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flagging watch through the next night</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the appearance of the light. Strux</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Colonel had already pointed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope to the peak, so that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuously embraced in the field of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the object-glass, otherwise it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been difficult to discern on a dark night;</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was, the light would doubtless be</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived immediately on its appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All day Sir John beat fruitlessly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes and long grass. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">unearth a single animal that was fit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat. The very birds, disturbed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their retreats, had gone to the underwood</seg><seg type="columnLine">on shore for shelter. Sir John was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely vexed, inasmuch as he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting merely for personal gratification,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to supply the necessities of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party. Perhaps he himself suffered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from hunger more than his three col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues, whose attention was more en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grossed in their application to science.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sailors and Mokoum suffered equal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly with Sir John. One more day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their scanty reserve would be at an end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if the pioneer's expedition were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">layed, they would soon be exposed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">severe extremity of hunger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dark, calm night was passed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching; but the horizon remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped in shade, and no light appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the object-glass of the telescope. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">minimum of time, however, allowed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expedition had hardly expired, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they felt that they were bound to exer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cise patience for a while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day the garrison ate their</seg><seg type="columnLine">last morsel of meat and biscuit; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">their courage did not fail, and, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they should be obliged to feed on what</seg><seg type="columnLine">herbs they could gather, they were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved to hold out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The succeeding night passed without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any result. More than once the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomers believed that they had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light, but it always proved to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">star in the misty horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the 1st of March they were com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled absolutely to fast. Having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some time accustomed to meager and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inadequate nourishment, they passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first day without much acute suffering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but on the morrow they began to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience the pangs of craving. Sir John</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mokoum, haggard-eyed, and sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitive to the gnawings of hunger, wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered over the top of the mountain; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">no game whatever was to be seen. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to think that, as the Colonel had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, they should literally have to feed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on grass. If they unly had the stom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">achs of ruminants, thought poor Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John, as he eyed the abundant pasturage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would be able to hold out; but still</seg><seg type="columnLine">no game, still not even a bird! He gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently over the lake, in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors had fished in vain; and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to get near the wary</seg><seg type="columnLine">aquatic birds that skimmed the tranquil</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, worn out with fatigue, Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">John and his companion lay down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass at the foot of a mound of earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">some five or six feet high. Here they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, not precisely into a sleep, but into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy torpor, which for a while be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbed their sufferings. How long this</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsiness would have lasted neither of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them could have said; but in about an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour Sir John was aroused by a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreeable pricking. He tried to slumber</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, but the pricking continued, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last impatiently he opened his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was entirely covered, face, hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clothes, with swarms of white ants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He started to his feet, and his sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement aroused the bushman, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was covered in the same way. But to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir John's great surprise, the bushman</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of shaking off the insects, carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">them by handfuls to his mouth, and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voured them greedily. Sir John's first</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation was disgust at his voracity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, eat, do as I do!" said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushman; "it is the rice of the Bochjes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that was, in truth, the native</seg><seg type="columnLine">term for these insects. The Bochjesmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feed on both the black and white species,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they consider the white to be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior quality. The only drawback is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they must be swallowed in large</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantities to satisfy any longing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">food. The Africans generally mix them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the gum of the mimosa, thus ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering them capable of affording a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">substantial meal; but as the mimosa did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not grow on Mount Scorzef, the bush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had to content himself with his rice</seg><seg type="columnLine">an naturel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sir John, in spite of his repugnance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolved to imitate him. The insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured forth by thousands from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous ant-hill, which was none other</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the mound of earth by which the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weary sufferers had reclined. Sir John</seg><seg type="columnLine">took them by handfuls, and carried them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his lips; he did not dislike the flavor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was a grateful acid; and gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt his hunger moderated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mokoum did not forget his compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions in misfortune. He ran to the fort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought out the garrison. The sail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ors were without difficulty induced to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack the singular food, and although the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers hesitated for a moment, yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouraged by Sir John's example, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half dead with inanition, they soon at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least assuaged the intenseness of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger by devouring considerable quan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tities of these ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But an unexpected incident procured</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the starving men a more solid meal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In order to lay in a provision of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects, Mokoum resolved to destroy one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the enormous ant-hill. It con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted of a central conical mound, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller cones arranged at intervals</seg><seg type="columnLine">around its base. The hunter had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">made several blows with his hatchet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a singular grunting sound from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center attracted his attention; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused in his work of destruction, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened, while his companions watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in silence. He struck a few more</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows, and the groan was repeated more</seg><seg type="columnLine">audibly than before. The bushman</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed his hands, while his eyes evident-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly sparkled. Once more attacking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant-hill, he opened a cavity about a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide. The ants were escaping on every</seg><seg type="columnLine">side; but of them he took no heed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the sailors to collect them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacks. All at once a strange animal ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared at the mouth of the hole. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a quadruped with a long snout, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small mouth, and flexible tongue, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">protruded to a great length; its ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">were straight, its legs short; and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail long and pointed. Long gray bristles</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a reddish tinge covered its lank</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, and its feet were armed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous claws. Mokoum killed it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">MEASURING A MERIDIAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">once with a sharp blow on the snout.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is our supper," he said.

Now for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fire, and a ramrod for a spit, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will feast as we have never feasted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lives."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bushman speedily began to skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">the animal, which was a species of eden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate, an ant-eater, very common in South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Africa, and known to the Dutch at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cape under the name of "aardvark."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swarms of ants are devoured by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature, which catches them by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its long glutinous tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The meal was soon cooked; perhaps it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been better for a few more</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns of the spit, but the hungry men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were impatient.

I had some recol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lection of having done it all, but I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not make head or tail of it after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of the series expansion. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped the folded sheets into my pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left without thought of breakfast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was not unusual because I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose early enough for it, and, at that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I usually had to hurry to my eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock classes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I would not see Pearson until eleven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since we were not taking the same elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive courses. At eleven we met outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of 301 and entered Kroelich's</seg><seg type="columnLine">classroom. When we had reached our</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats, Kroclich came up to us, and, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a word, put before us half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheets of figures. Immediately I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if he had had the same experience</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had the night before.

The watch was gone!</seg><seg type="columnLine">We ran to the receiver and saw what</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have formerly been the watch, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it looked more like a metal duplicate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fried egg than anything else I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of. At the time we forgot the sad</seg><seg type="columnLine">plight of the professor's watch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced about shouting, at the tops of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our voices, various incoherent words to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect that we had been successful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the first violent reaction, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were partially dazed.

We waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps it was only a few minutes un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til there was a snap, and a page of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor's notebook appeared before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. On it was his cramped writing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right, fellows.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter is queer looking, but, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, it resembles ours to some degree. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have also examined the receiver in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment with me and find it not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like our own.

Where was he? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the transmitter did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall near any of the planets of our sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem. Perhaps he was on a system re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mote in our galaxy or perhaps even out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that! IIow long had it taken him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the journey at one billion the vel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocity of light?' I hastily wrote a note</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking the professor to time the arrival.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had always prided himself on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">accuracy of his new watch, (we had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to iron out the one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty cycle ripple on his old one), and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the laboratory was an electric clock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Certainly the distance was great enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get some idea of its magnitude. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the time of transmission, and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to the second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back came the message, "No mea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surable lapsed time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kroelich cut down to a factor of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand times the velocity of light and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we tried again.

Next we tried the velocity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light itself, but still the professor could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not measure the interval. We began to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">look at each other in surprise. Three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four seconds should be noticeable. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make the distance roughly half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million miles, and what body was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the earth? Yet the indications</seg><seg type="columnLine">were that it was even closer. I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think that something was quite wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here goes the reversing switch," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pearson as he changed the multiplier to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a divisor. "Half the velocity of light."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time the dean showed surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inquired if everything were in work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing order.	r</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One hundredth, or only 1860 miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per second," said Kroclich.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still too small to measure was the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port.

Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly I sat up in bed. If distances in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own solar system were relatively the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same as those of the supposed atom, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not life be possible on an elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tron, such as we thought the latter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be? Why could not all of the stars we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see in the sky be protons with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their planets the electrons of some ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crocosmic system? Was there a limit in</seg><seg type="columnLine">either direction? Were the relative dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tances and structures merely accidentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such nonsense I told myself, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not sleep. I realized suddenly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was trying to prove to myself that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dean had been only forty feet from us</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the time, tremendously reduced in</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of course. But what could cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a reduction ? Wrhat would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">his molecules shrink accordingly? If</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had not, he would have been all</seg><seg type="columnLine">protons and electrons with no space!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The energy needed to force all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrons from their orbits would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been more than a human mind could</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceive. There would have been no</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor, as we had known him, if that</seg><seg type="columnLine">process had taken place. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been in the wall in a microcosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary system, that was all there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it! The minutes he had been away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us would have been thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries on an electron. Yet scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">were agreeing there was no such thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as time; we merely measured intervals</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of seconds, minutes, hours,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">etc. Yet would not full lives seemingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lived to men, assuming the possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life on an electron, in a bare fraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a second ticked off by an earthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock? Perhaps, after all, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing definite about time!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a few more attempts at an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation, I fell back to sleep. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning I was in as much of a muddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">as before. Why did my idea persist</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I knew it could not be? I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">say nothing about it to my friends be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it seemed so absurd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet, during the next two days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the checks we made proved that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the indicator was correct, and the idea I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had was more firmly fixed in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. Its unreasonableness kept me</seg><seg type="columnLine">from mentioning it, though I wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Pearson had similar thoughts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"TT seems we must accept things as</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they are until we can get an</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomical chart from the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, or give them one of ours, hoping</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they, with it and their advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">science can point out their location in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our galaxy, if they are that near us,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the professor after we had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">up trying to solve the riddle. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no link to show the reason for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous discrepancy. Why not all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us take the trip ?

I said to myself, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next afternoon, after the dean, Kroelich</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pearson had taken the voyage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent reassuring messages, I found my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self on the pedestal as if in a dream. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be real, and I believe I actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed out loud, rather hollowly, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Calloway, Kroelich's junior assistant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been taken into our confidence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at the controls of the transmitter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was cold through and through, as,</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAM TRANSMISSION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one by one, the switches were closed. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calloway touched the last switch handle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had a mad desire to jump, but fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">had paralyzed me, and, suddenly, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisked from the light through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefest interval of darkness and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">light again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ABOUT me were my three friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">J~\ smiling, each with reassuring words</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not bad, was it?" inquired Pearson</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hand on my shoulder, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">look r</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did and stared in wonder at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight before my eyes. Yes, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive, but what a nightmare! Four mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters, living discs fully as great in di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ameter as an average man's height with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacles eight feet long. And what</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces! Still, there was no ferocious ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression, only what I should interpret as</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerness. They were a deep red color</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had large, piercing black eyes. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">were reclining on an edge of the disc</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed to be the body proper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting it to keep it from falling flat by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of the smooth, snake-like ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacles. All about the periphery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disc were two rows, one on each edge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of little cup-like appendages. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no sign of hair or clothes with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exception that small discs of metal on</seg><seg type="columnLine">cords were about their stubby necks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ears were membranes about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of a silver dollar on the sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head on the surface. The hole between</seg><seg type="columnLine">and below the eyes was undoubtedly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing tube. The lips were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy, but the mouth was very wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lending rather an unpleasant expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the face. The teeth were quite like</seg><seg type="columnLine">human teeth in shape, quite uniform and</seg><seg type="columnLine">black as ebony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dean, an old friend by virtue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his previous visit, was naturally our</seg><seg type="columnLine">spokesman. At the time he resorted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesticulations and sign language. First</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of all he tried to show the creatures that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we wanted to leave our prison of glass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In response, one of the beings pressed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">button on the wall, and shortly after, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man entered, not a bit different from us</seg><seg type="columnLine">except in his manner of dress. He wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tunic which fell to his knees, and on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet were sandals. His features were</seg><seg type="columnLine">classic, while his hair was kept from fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over his eyes by a red band about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, crossing his forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS attitude was not that of a servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">for there was no suggestion of ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vility in his manner. After a short con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation, while he was kept from us by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intervening sheets of glass, the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the room. Nothing transpired for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time, so I took in our compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. It was entirely made of clear glass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was the antiseptic atomizer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dean had mentioned in his first message.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the exception of insulating ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terials, which seemed to be of a sulphur</seg><seg type="columnLine">basis, the receiver was not unlike our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own. The transmitter in the room out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, was a bit larger than ours, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was recognizable as the counterpart. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was lighted indirectly by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hanging, translucent bowls. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls were smooth and white, the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial was similar to gypsum plaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The creatures were standing, if it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be called that, about a table near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter. On the wall behind the lat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter was a control board, and, to one side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a series of buttons, one of which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned the man to the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I cannot guess how much time elapsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the man had returned with three</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions, because the strange sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roundings were of such interest. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">had what turned out to be thin, light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hermetically sealed suits with removable</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent helmets. On the front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each was a disinfector like a gas mask,</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowing free intake of air for breathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but sterilizing it and the exhaled breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as the latter passed out to the outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. Apparently there was little differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence in the composition of their atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere from ours. I learned later that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen content was a little lower, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference being made up by nitrogen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, little difference existed in the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gravity of that world from our own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The suits were placed in a small glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber adjoining ours. The door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, and the first man we had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated we were to open the door lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the small chamber to ours and</seg><seg type="columnLine">don the suits. They had been sprayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">after having been placed in the small com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment to safeguard us. Without much</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitation and little discussion we did so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall spray each other to eradicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effects of touching the suits," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor before we connected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmets, which were secured by a quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that, we used sign language be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween ourselves, since our voices were</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaudible through the helmets. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprayed each other, the creatures and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four men showed pleasure that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the meaning of the whole proce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dure. The creatures' mouths curled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">what must have been smiles or grins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the expressions on the men's faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">were those of happiness of normal peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple as we know them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER we had finished our disinfec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, we passed through the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass doors and stood before the group.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only friendliness was apparent, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could hardly judge the superior be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings by their expressions. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy when the man we had first seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a few words with one of the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, led us from the room to a corri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dor, into which opened many doors at</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular intervals. We entered an auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic elevator not much different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">those on earth, and, at a rapid rate, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended. After perhaps twenty seconds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the elevator came to a stop, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out into a corridor similar to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one many stories above. Our guide opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first door and motioned for us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter what were apparently our living</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters, a suite of five rooms with com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable lounges and pillows. The gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral impression was that of earthly orien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal luxury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After ten minutes of gesticulation, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide succeeded in explaining to Dean</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harvey that we could remove our suits</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our quarters, but we must wear them</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we intended leaving it, using a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">infectant as before. Then he nodded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the door. We immediately took</seg><seg type="columnLine">off our suits with various comments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderment over what we had seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pearson was the first one out of his suit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reached a window before the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us. Below, many stories, was a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenue, while all about were glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">white towers and massive structures</seg><seg type="columnLine">graceful in spite of their immensity. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw, at the end of the avenue, a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">park with white groups of statues and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountains, but the angle of vision from</seg><seg type="columnLine">our position was so narrow that we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see very little of it. The other end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenue continued as far as the eye could</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach with tall buildings hemming it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on both sides. A number of cross-streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also visible at regular intervals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sun was shining in the heavens</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere, but the most startling thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that the sky above was a bright car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine in color. Fleecy white clouds drift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed across this (to us) amazing back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, blown by a breeze we could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel in our closed apartment. Dean Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vey forbade us to attempt opening a win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Apparently I was correct in my ideas</seg><seg type="columnLine">of contamination," he said without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride. A man of his learning makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">statements of facts without even expect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to be refuted and finds no satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in their ultimate proof, for he knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAM TRANSMISSION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth when he states the facts.

When all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts are considered, it is really a won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der that men exist at all on this world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much less so near in scale to the domi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant beings. Why should evolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">choose our type to be supreme or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent on every inhabited planet, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably all of them are inhabited? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should life be impossible in atmospheres</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed almost entirely of hydrogen or</seg><seg type="columnLine">in temperatures too low for us?

I am surprised that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">world is as similar to ours as it is, espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially with regard to atmosphere, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact is very important to us, naturally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably existing in very few of the my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riads of solar systems. We are the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">extra-terrestrials to visit this world. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">may of course be rightfully proud and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel highly honored, but it has been du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicated countless millions of times in</seg><seg type="columnLine">other systems. The universe is without</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, infinite in the fullest meaning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word.

Mechanical forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as the lever and the wheel would</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear with the dawn of any civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half a dozen men and four women, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter the first we had seen, were await-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing us.

The girl then put on</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm-length flexible gloves of a material</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to rubber, and, taking a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty hypodermic syringe in her right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, inserted both hands through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes in the wall. I saw then that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">too were rubber covered, each having</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opening which would close when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms were withdrawn, preventing an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening to the air of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shrank back when I saw the syringe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	was not going to be a martyr to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments or a sacrifice to furnish ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial for a few notebook pages on ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced surgical experiments! The pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor was nodding to me, telling me not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be frightened.

It did not take her long to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">me she merely wanted a blood specimen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After that I co-operated to the best of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ability, grasping my left arm tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the elbow with my right hand, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time flexing the fingers of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN a moment, like an expert which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">undoubtedly was, she had applied a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swab and made the introduction into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vein.

In part, this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, but the microscopes through great</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnification and very brilliant illumina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion projected the images on screens</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted horizontally behind the instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leucocytes and red corpuscles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent as well as various other cell</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms, bactcria, no doubt, but I was hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly familiar with this study and could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">identify them. Movements were per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptible in some, but the heat from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant source of lighting was causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each operator was sketching all differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent cell forms before him and writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">comments after each. The work required</seg><seg type="columnLine">very few minutes in the hands of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">experts. A comparison was made by all</seg><seg type="columnLine">four men. Evidently one of them had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found evidence of something different</seg><seg type="columnLine">or unusual. Immediately I wondered if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I were sick with something, but the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendant, who had made the discovery, mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned to Dean Harvey to follow him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our guide then touched our shoulders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and beckoned the three of us to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. We were reluctant to leave the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor behind, but we could conceive of</seg><seg type="columnLine">no harm coming to him, after our experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence with the doctors of this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we had removed our suits in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our rooms, Pearson and I voiced our cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iosity. Kroelich was silent for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then spoke words which sickened us</seg><seg type="columnLine">at heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess you boys did not know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dean Harvey is dying of internal cancer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is one of the reasons he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid to make the first trip. He has not</seg><seg type="columnLine">many weeks to live, but he certainly is</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting up a mighty brave fight. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">say anything about it to him. I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these men have discovered his serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">state through some evidence in his blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimen. They would naturally show</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in something different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms in our blood specimens."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">D ROFESSOR HARVEY returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">during our further discussion of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">plight, whereupon we forced smiles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all helped him remove his suit. In spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his apparent cheerfulness, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a hidden hint of terror in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I feel far more honored than</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fellows," were his first words.

Never a word from</seg><seg type="columnLine">those lips complaining of the mental and</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical torture he had endured for</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, without the slightest ray of hope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Discovery had been too late for surgical</seg><seg type="columnLine">removal. Every day brought the inevit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able end much nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was some time before we were able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think of other things about us. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, and sometimes twice a day, we ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed messages with Calloway. Prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably I shall not mention this fact again</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for it became one of our regular routines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That evening upon our response to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock, four figures in suits entered. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had books and writing materials under</seg><seg type="columnLine">their arms. At first glance their helmets</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed different from those we wore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Closer scrutiny revealed they were equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped with transmitters and receivers for</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication with us and that the wear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers were femiffine. We were to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">our first lessons!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seems they hope our visit will be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthy one," Pearson observed, "but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">see no need to hurry our departure since</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can go at any time, and this is some</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience. I'll bet we will be shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is no need to go into much de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail concerning the instructions. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had expected, the language was simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">after centuries of change and perfecting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, it was common to the men and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior beings. After only a week we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had practically mastered the spoken as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as the written tongue. The voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the girls were little different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">those we had heard on earth. The langu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age itself was hardly beautiful in sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was practical. I wondered if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardness was typical of the race, if art</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unknown and if everything was sacri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficed for practical things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our instructors were both patient and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant. They had duties to perform</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were performing them, probably feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing some pride in being the first to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">really intelligent contact with the visitors</seg><seg type="columnLine">from another planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as we had the barest working</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the new tongue, we poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">continual streams of questions into our</seg><seg type="columnLine">teachers' ears. There were no secrets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all of the answers were simple and</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct. Either everyone knew all there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to know or these four were particul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arly cognizant of their world and its hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penings. Judging from what standards</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could supply, their globe was only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly smaller in diameter than ours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but its surface was nine-tenths water with</seg><seg type="columnLine">only two continents, Sar, upon which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, and Poru, a nearby island of very</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly the same size. There were smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands, belonging to each continent, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">relatively little importance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE days were approximately twen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty-two hours of our time in length</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the temperature ranges were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to those on the earth, even at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poles which were solid ice-caps. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fyns, or creatures we had first seen, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">truly a puzzle to us. They bothered lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle about the humans, being more tolerant</seg><seg type="columnLine">than loving. They acted as protectors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but did not demand tribute or even labor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They supplied much of the machine de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign for they were very skilled mentally.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The brain was not any larger than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man, but the Fyns concentrated only</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few fields. Surgery and medicine</seg><seg type="columnLine">were far advanced as were mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">devices. Atomic power had been released,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but was not yet extensively used except</seg><seg type="columnLine">in aircraft and vehicles. There was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy work to be done outside of mining</seg><seg type="columnLine">and building, and the older atomic hydro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gen engines were relatively efficient. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical energy was still used as a source</seg><seg type="columnLine">of much power. The change to atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">power was being made gradually.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men were taught by the Fyns and given</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything in the way of knowledge. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">civil wars had ever been recorded. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was understood that men were expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to aid in a national emergency. So, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they mixed little socially and lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart., life, in general, ran very smoothly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed the Fyns even looked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride upon their kind and unselfish treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the other race though they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">never arrogant. There was perhaps a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of superiority--rightfully, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew that man depended on them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for better methods and other vital mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters. Men were their children!</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAM TRANSMISSION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the island of Poru lived the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings like the Fyns except in color,</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Rus, and, with them, in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner as on Sar, men similar to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sar. The same relations existed also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the population had become far too</seg><seg type="columnLine">great for convenience. Sar, hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years before, had been visited by a plague,</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced to bacteria from the nearest planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their solar system, which had wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out three-quarters of the population in</seg><seg type="columnLine">four days, before it had been checked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with serums. , Poru had lost only rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively few, for their physicians had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">an antitoxin, luckily enough, at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the very first day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BECAUSE the Rus had been too busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">saving their own nation, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not given much thought to their neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bors on Sar. A feeling of bitterness de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped quite naturally, the Rus claim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing medical superiority, while the Fyns</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated all the peoples of Poru, becausc they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not aided them. Though the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies had passed, it was not difficult for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two nations to find little hates to add</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the original store, for one does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">need to go far to find trouble. A state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of armed truoe had existed for fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. Neither side cared to strike the</seg><seg type="columnLine">offensive blow, since both had the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines of destruction and protective de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vices against them. New inventions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas did spring up, but both nations had</seg><seg type="columnLine">such clever spy systems that nothing im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant ever happened on either island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which remained a secret longer than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day or two!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was obvious that such a truce could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not last forever, and, sooner or later, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">break would occur, probably instigated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the people of Poru, who must find</seg><seg type="columnLine">space for their extra millions. By very</seg><seg type="columnLine">special precautions, the Fyns had kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret the method of our coming, but our</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence was at once known, and also</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were visitors from another solar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">system. The Rus demanded they be al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed to extend the visitors a welcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Poru, which was only fitting and prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er they said. But prompt refusal was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the answer of the Sarians. Immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">diplomatic relations were strained to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping point. The four of us had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned to aid in the destruction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poru, was the gist of a message!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our quarters were immediately changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lower floors of the building, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hundred feet under the surface, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of armed men stationed 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">every floor above us to prevent our kid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naping, but after a few days the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew over as such matters do. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">cancer was added on both sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of the depth, we detected no</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference in the comfort of our new</seg><seg type="columnLine">suite, even dampness being lacking. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course all of our illumination was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial. What wre had taken for incan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent bulbs were really radiators of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light flux fed by quartz rod transmission</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines from central light-stations. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to see all of these things in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, we were told by our instructors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who still spent hours with us, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part devoted to answering our ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. The dean had been repeatedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">called away to the surgical room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For some tests," he explained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a week he had lost the haunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in his eyes, and he seemed less like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dying man that we thought he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These fellows certainly are medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">geniuses," he said. "I'll have something</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous to tell you boys before long, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tests are successful!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His smile was more in evidence day</seg><seg type="columnLine">after day. A few days later the four of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us were taken to the medical laboratory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">,and all but the dean were given a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">injection and told to lie upon the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately. The dean told us that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had his the day before. Suddenly we</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a terrific nausea followed by pains</seg><seg type="columnLine">100</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which caused a sudden lapse of conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, perhaps only for several seconds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still feeling weak, we were motioned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arise and remove our suits!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole nation of Sarians had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">inoculated for all of the diseases we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried, and we had been likewise inocu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated for theirs which were very few. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">injections we had just had were also for</seg><seg type="columnLine">something the dean had carried in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodstream, not found in the three of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it is not contagious," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor to the attendant, "and it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a germ disease!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will agree that you are recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, will you not?" asked the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, but your injections have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct and merely destroyed what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">term the irritant which causes abnormal</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell growth such as cancer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True enough," returned the Sarian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but if this irritant were duplicated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory and strengthened a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand fold, it would promote cancerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth on contact and at a prodigious</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate. See!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE were led to another room where</seg><seg type="columnLine">large glass jars stood in long rows</seg><seg type="columnLine">on tables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In cultures, all of your bacteria were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bred separately and serums made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their destruction.

We were asked to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the roof where our ships awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.

Now and then one of us would</seg><seg type="columnLine">dart off unexpectedly, due to our inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience, but in fifteen minutes we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuver quite expertly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tops of the cabins could be pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">back from the cockpits so we could con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse if the distance between speakers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not too great.

No doubt, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of these beings, green foliage and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue sky would be just as entrancing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast forests spread below and beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue cliffs, we had seen, in various shades</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blue while lighter patches denoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings in the forest, often following</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams for many miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We reduccd our speed and lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">our ships to just clear the tops of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tallest trees.

Soon we came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large rocky clearing, a bright yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch in contrast to the field of blue. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered our craft gently and stepped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The yellow coloration was due to a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sandstone, fragments of which cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered several acres, forming a low hill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We walked to the edge of the forest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a cool inviting breath from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomy depths.

Suddenly there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep rumble of thunder. We concluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had best return if we wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep our clothes dry. As we retreated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thunder became louder and more fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent. Drops of rain fell here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time we reached the clearing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lightning was illuminating the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky with such frequent flashes, that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seldom darkness. The rain had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started in earnest! A stiff wind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring through the forest all about us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying the tops of the trees violently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dean and Kroelich were first to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ships and hurriedly pulled their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin tops over them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pearson and I were not much behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and soon all of us were rising,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kroelich and Harvey above.

Pearson saw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled away over the tree tops too, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of us settled down just before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached the tree tops. No use to bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle that storm, for, if it were like an earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly thunder storm, it would last only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short while. We settled close together and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited. The rain was falling in such tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rents that the forest edge could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. The electric display had almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased. Soon I could no longer make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pearson's ship in the terrific downpour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After perhaps ten minutes the flood</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to lessen, and I peered out. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rain was still too heavy to see Pearson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I did see his ship. I looked a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Yes, his cabin was open! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he done? Regardless of the rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was still falling, I pushed open my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatch and jumped to the ground. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in the ship! Certainly he would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone into the forest. I saw too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">footprints of men's shoes in the stiff clay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with evidences of a struggle, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his ray pistol at one side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shouted his name again and again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rain had ceased, and the sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining through the thinning clouds. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about the clearing and saw an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ship, half turned over against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. I grasped my pistol and ran to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inside was an inert figure slumped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seat. The ship must have been hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the earth by the wind while the rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">was falling heaviest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I HAD some difficulty in opening the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof since the car had been badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">warped by the fall, but I finally forced it</seg><seg type="columnLine">open with a rock far enough to grasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pilot under the shoulders and hoist</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out. It was a girl, unconscious or</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps even dead, to judge from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">color of her face. I dipped my handker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief in a puddle of water formed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollowed rock and wiped her face with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. She was not dead, for I could feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">her pulse and detect her breathing. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">she groaned and opened her eyes. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not speak but bit her lips to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">from crying out, pointing to her right</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg. I removed the boot she was wearing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first I had seen on Sar, and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">her leg had been fractured just above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ankle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I was thus occupied, I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts from behind and found that Kroe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lich and the professor had returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely. I breathed a sigh of relief that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no harm had befallen them. They ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me, thinking some harm had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Pearson. When they saw that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAM TRANSMISSION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl beside me, they asked the where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts of our companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He just disappeared!" I said. "When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rain had stopped sufficiently for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make out his ship, I saw the cabin top</seg><seg type="columnLine">was open. He must have been captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">by someone, for there are footprints in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mud about the ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went over to it and began shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his name. The girl's ship was hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly wrecked, so I carefully carried her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mine and made her as comfortable as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could in the small cabin. I was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to squeeze in myself. The ship rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a very noticeable effort due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual load. Kroelich and the dean had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally given up the search and were fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing me, soon passing us on their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the city to report the kidnaping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I landed on the roof of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building, scouts were already on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the forest clearing.

"Cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly no Sarian would do a thing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that!

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">said she had seen nothing and heard no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. She frequently flew over the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ests, landing often and wandering about</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the solitude.

He will be returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-morrow. It is thought the abductors</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be caught before they can make good</seg><seg type="columnLine">their escape. The message sent was sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">castic in tone, the essence of it being, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the men from another world were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not permitted to taste the hospitality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poru, it had been forced upon one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them at least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any further news will be given you</seg><seg type="columnLine">on receipt."

I was securely</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound but otherwise not maltreated. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed within fifty yards of a Sarian pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol ship, but they didn't see us! One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pilots grinned and motioned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect that the Sarians were fools.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fellows, that ship had been rendered</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible!

We rose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof and found the professor, Pear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and Kroelich already there, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of picked troops formed a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don under a canopy which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched over the entire square mile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof-top. A thousand bullet-like atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes stood in line, their red, sleek</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream-lined sides glistening in the arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial lighting under the cover. Small</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass bombs of the terrible cancer cells</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their catalyst were being attached to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bomb droppers inside the ships. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">untold horrors were these ships with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">single pilots, some Fyns, some men. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">least half of these small craft were radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled, faster and more deadly by far</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the others. The acceleration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those having living pilots was limited by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human factor as was the maneuver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability. Not so with the radio-controlled</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships. They could speed up to a tenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">the velocity of light in thirty seconds, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could dip and turn with such great speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no living being could exist in them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After loading, the ships were lined up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the far edge of the roof preparatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">to taking off on their sinister missions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, one by one, the long slender ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships dropped under the canopy and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their full compliments of waiting men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Fyns, a hundred to a ship. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were four hundred of these, yet all were</seg><seg type="columnLine">manned and poised behind the smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships in three-quarters of an hour. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to withstand the brunt of the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense the Rus would put up, and to allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many as possible of the torpedo ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break through the protective screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls which would be erected about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongholds of Poru. In these ray ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the men and Fyns who would con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol the radio-directed ships. These four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred ships were not the last, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secondary ships were being manned one</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one, ships of various uses with special</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays and destructive powers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T ET us go below to the screen," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lele as the secondary offensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes were being manned and pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into position behind the ray ships. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack will be launched by the time we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> W^hen we had reached the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lele had made the proper adjustments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ships were already leaving the roof top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The night is very clear," she com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented, "and we shall not miss any</seg><seg type="columnLine">details."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The receiving beam followed the van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard accurately under Lele's skilled fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers. As the miles flew by, the magnifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation kept pace, but very little definition</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half way to the island of Poru some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing happened. Suddenly and, to us, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectedly, the tiny bullet-like torpedo</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, in twos and threes, grew luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then incandescent. Brilliant white</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots appeared, and the tough metal sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">108</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">melted off in great blobs. The ray ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled ahead as the torpedo craft all</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowed down. No enemy ships were visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble, but those heat rays were not capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of transmission for many thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. The great emerald and violet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue rays, beautiful to see, slowly cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the sky above and the ocean below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly a luminous glow appeared. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an enemy ship, caught in a ray, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it had been almost invisible when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it attacked the torpedo ships. It writhed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twisted in the beam from the ray ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">but could not escape the nimble fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Sarian operator. Another ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined the first and gradually the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">outline of the green Poruvian ship be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came visible, as the invisibility screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke down under the tremendous energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A third ray, a repulsive ray, Lele said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot out to the ship. It writhed for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment and then whirled away. A sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den scream rent the air for miles as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth ray from the Sarian ship stabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night, a vacuum ray which caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship as it was being hurled farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. It flattened as the last ray pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship irresistibly against the repulsive</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray. The rays released the ill-fated at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacker which fell to the sea with no life</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But more Sarian torpedo ships were</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling. Other invisible enemies were at</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, their numbers increasing steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently. The ray ships were being at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked now, though their protective</seg><seg type="columnLine">screens were holding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a change in the formation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sarians was made. The ray ships formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cube with the torpedo craft inside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again the relentless advance continued. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was struck by the lack of strategy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">foresight. At any time the invisible en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emy might pass on and attack Sar. Lele</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied that the lust for battle, so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsatisfied, made both nations crazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the desire to wreak havoc each upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. The thrill would be lacking if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sar were attacked, unprotected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every now and then an enemy ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be caught in the maze of rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out by the larger Sarian ships, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the increasing number of glaring spots</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the protective screens of the latter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">told of hundreds of invisible ships. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to me that the Poruvians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not using their new weapon to the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage. The long peaceful era had</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly brought about a decay of battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">tactics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the distance a faigt green glow ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The protective screen wall about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island of Poru," explained Lele. "It will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to be broken down before any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our ships can pass through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now there were more brilliant splashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of color on the ray ship screens. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays were bringing into visibility the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ships of Poru awaiting the armada</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Sar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I 'HE real battle begins here and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  -I- now!" I said aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cube formation changed to a cyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inder with the open end toward the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fensive ray screen of the Poruvians. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward ships of Sar concentrated their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays upon a single spot, hoping to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the screen to give an opening for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the torpedo ships. Ships of Poru hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise, for they immediately began a</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated attack on the foremost craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cylindrical formation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After several ships had gone directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the Sarians and the screen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">been instantly vaporized by the concentra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of rays, the remainder stayed well</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside of the path. The screen of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poruvians was becoming very dense about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attacking fleet, being barely visible a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards away. What an opening it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, but the torpedoes were all inside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the formation and could not take advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage of it. The protective wall could</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEAM TRANSMISSION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">109</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have been broken down with very few</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams I was sure. It was holding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sarians at the point of attack, however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Poruvians now adopted the tac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tics of the attackers, half a dozen ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">directing their concentrated rays on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sarian ship. Screens of the latter flared</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliantly, great flames of energy shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the air for hundreds of yards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now came the special Sarian ray ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing to the aid of the larger craft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacking the Poruvians from the flank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With this new menace, many of the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned from attempting the destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cylindrical formation to fight off</seg><seg type="columnLine">this new enemy. These special ray ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">were small and nimble. With only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">special ray as a weapon and small pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tective screens, they were forced to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the way of the larger ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We soon saw that the enemy had such</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships in his fleet, with the result that dog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fights ensued with the most spectacular</seg><seg type="columnLine">displays of rays and coruscations, beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful to see but terrible in their destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive powers. Millions upon millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsepower were being expended in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">few cubic miles of space just off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island of Poru. Screams of vacuum rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crackling of protective screens fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off attacking rays made a din which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even at our distance, we had never before</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined. Ship after ship dropped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">molten masses after the slightest breaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their screens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The forces were too evenly matched</seg><seg type="columnLine">for progress in either direction. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall must be penetrated soon or no tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedo ships would reach the island. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">change in formation suddenly appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a double layer of Sarian ray ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the attacking end of the cylinder. Half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the torpedo craft were left unprotected</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this change in formation, disappear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing almost instantaneously as the Poru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vians rayed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the screen was flaming miles high.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At any moment it might break down. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deep rumble rose above the already terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fic roar, the ray ships trembling from</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem to stern. Lele explained that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were making the last attempt, liberating</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy at an inconceivable rate. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplies would be gone in a very few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes at this rate, and they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless before the enemy-rays. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last straw. The roar grew as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">visor screen before us grew misty. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat must have been terrific, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean was boiling and steaming for miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">around from the secondary radiations</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a tremendous blaze of glaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">white light, the island screen snapped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly a solid stream of torpedo ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">were through, probably eight or nine of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them before the screen again closed. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one, the Sarian ships cut their rays,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they flared incandescent and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhing to the boiling ocean below. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had accomplished their missions. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">none were left, and the special ray ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing the brunt of the attack of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole Poruvian navy, suddenly ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting and hurtled back for Sar. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit came the invisible fleet, intent on</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally reducing Sar. They could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that in a few hours they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only living Poruvians, and when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to Poru, victorious, they too</seg><seg type="columnLine">would contract a horrible death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHILLS ran up and down my spine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How long would our protective</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen hold the hordes with no navy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid us? Vengeance of the Poruvians</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be horrible. Life on Sar would</seg><seg type="columnLine">end just as life on Poru was ending even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Lele trembled as she followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat and the advance. A few auxiliary</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships of Sar were coming to the useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack of an invisible enemy.

Soon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiss of the rays was audible through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed windows of the room, and the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emy ships came into actual view.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor was gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a terrific roar and crash that</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw us from our feet.

I felt myself disintegrate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was not painful in the least! I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still conscious. I tried to open my eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pain was coming back. The din was</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing fainter.

They burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightfully as I did all over. I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, but I did hear a murmur of</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices nearby, and something cold touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">my forehead. I closed my eyes once</seg><seg type="columnLine">moie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bell!"

I opened my eyes with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort, and this time I saw something</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly above me. I realized I was flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my back. Slowly my vision was clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and I made out the face of Lele.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you dead, too?"

Was I not dead? I moved my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head slightly and saw Pearson, Kroe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lich and the professor all smiling through</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears. They moved closer to me. I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head to the other side as I felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prick in my arm. Several doctors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing there, one of whom was admin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istering a hypodermic injection. I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the others once more. The pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">was driving me mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where am I?"

Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, I was happy to have Lele with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me all of the time, but I did miss the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daily visits of my partners.

For instance, one end</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be on the surface and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">end on the bottom of a river, or the vor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tex may extend between two objects in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fluid, terminating with one end on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each object, but it is utterly impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a vortex to remain half way in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluid without terminating in two boun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">daries of the fluid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about a smoke ring," I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded him. "Isn't that vortex?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes/' he admitted. "It is a vortex</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ends united to form a circle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm glad you brought that up, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it illustrates the idea I am undertak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to convey to you. In a smoke ring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the particles are revolving like small</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings strung on a large ring. In other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">words the ring is repeatedly turning in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side out. That of course is possible in</seg><seg type="columnLine">three dimensions, since the ring is sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilar to a two dimensional object which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is being twisted through a third dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The vortex motion which Hinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">uses to explain electrical phenomena is</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat analogous to this movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that instead of moving in rings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vortexes are in the shape of hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheres, which are constantly turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside-out. To use a familiar analogy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoke ring is like a rubber band</seg><seg type="columnLine">being twisted, while the vortex motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the electric current is like a tennis</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball which is being repeatedly turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Which led me to say, "Baron Munch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausen told some good ones, too."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What I am telling you are facts, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairy tales/' was his indignant response.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I can readily see that there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">little use for me to cast any more pearls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let it suffice to say that Hinton's theory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of four dimensional vortex motion in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ether surrounding an electrical con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductor, supplies a very logical and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vincing explanation of the way electricity</seg><seg type="columnLine">behaves.

Then, the ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion released, he gave vent to a torrent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of abuse and profanity that would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a mule driver blush with shame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thoroughgood paid no attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

Straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward us that great locomotive thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered.

For-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately the grove in which I.landed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpcted with thick, springy under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer's wife there, for some reason or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, took an interest in meteorites, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which there were a number lying about</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the vicinity of their home, so she</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to collect them, her husband tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing no interest in the matter. When she</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to get an unusually large one on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wagon, he contemptuously threw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. But presently a collector came</seg><seg type="columnLine">along who was interested in these celes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial visitors, and he began purchasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the farmer's wife, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are told that the farmer at once changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his point of view and took a very active</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in the affair. Quoting the words</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of Ralph Waldo Emerson, we may say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he "Found Gold and Gems in These</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dull Facts" and found that a meteorite</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a "rock of diamonds" just like Em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erson's "day of facts."

Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">in tarnation is that no account boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">now?" Ma Jones looked up from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooking, and as she wiped her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her apron said, "Well, Pa, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">might know, he is out in the workshop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixing that radio for the Roger boys.

"I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see why you couldn't relieve me once on</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for supper." "I'm sorry, Pa,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freddy returned, as he passed on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way down the path, to the filling station.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The old man went on into the house still</seg><seg type="columnLine">grumbling and solemnly assuring Ma</seg><seg type="columnLine">that "that boy never will amount to two</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticks, as long as he fiddles around with</seg><seg type="columnLine">coils and condensers and tubes and them</seg><seg type="columnLine">other radio gadgets." But the flames of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wrath were soon squelched under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deluge of a supper table covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an abundance of Ma's home cooking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Freddy always ate early, and then took</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the station from supper until clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing time. When business was slow, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-night, he spent the time with his short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave set. He heard the police dispatcher</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at Frameton broadcast a report of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank robbery in Louisville, and advising</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers to be on the look out for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue limousine with five men, carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">license plates 309227. For the next few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours he spent the time, between cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomers, by copying code.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About 11:00 P.

Freddy's first</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought was of the police report earlier</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the evening, as a second glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that it contained five men. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">well dressed young fellow hopped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the driver's seat and called to Freddy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fill 'er up son, we're in a hurry."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freddy went around to the rear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly passed out when he noted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">license number 309227.

The filling had to be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a can, which Tommy filled from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply inside the station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Freddy took the cap off the gas tank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to keep up his courage said to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver, "Boy, she's almost dry!" "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that," agreed the driver, "but just</seg><seg type="columnLine">go ahead, fill 'er up and make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">snappy." Freddy wished this bird would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take his right hand out of that side</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat-pocket, but since he didn't, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing else to do but "fill 'er up,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so he did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before Freddy could empty the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">can the driver was wanting to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">"how much?"

Freddy paused in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway as he heard the machine cough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sputter, then come to life and go roar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down the road toward Fernvale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Park.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Freddy decided to do a little unlicensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcasting.

"No no," Freddy assured him,,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"this is straight stuff, and you'll find 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalled, between here and the Park."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The police dispatcher evidently took</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freddy at his word, for he immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">started three cruisers in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Park. True to Freddy's predic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, they found five of. the Fuesetti</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang stalled by the roadside, lights out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ready for action. But when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluecoats unloaded with riot guns, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered the odds too great and "put</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em up." It was the work of but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes to frisk them, put on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bracelets and drive them to the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, where they were mugged and as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed to nice new quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old chief himself, delivered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reward to Freddy, patted him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, and rather insinuated that nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be said about his being non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licensed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took a snooping reporter to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the facts.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only fault that I can find is with some, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, of the stories you publish having "Time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Travel" as a theme. Some of these, it seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my mind, are overloaded with a great deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of technical complexities that the average</seg><seg type="columnLine">reader would fail to comprehend, as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">author had allowed his knowledge (or should</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say lack of knowledge, since little seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be known of this branch of science) of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject to run riot. I must admit that a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of it is away over my head, and since you</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit that A.

Of course, I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one among your thousands of readers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my dissatisfaction in this regard may be only</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to ignorance, while others may appreciate</seg><seg type="columnLine">such stories as being possessed of a better un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dertanding of the matter. My preference is</seg><seg type="columnLine">for interplanetary stories, of which I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">never get a surfeit, for, like many other would-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be adventurers, I like to read of new and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange worlds and to explore them at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spirit.

I disagree, since my contention is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing mankind uses is unnatural. Man uses</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we term artificial light, but it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnatural, because man is a product of nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so are the metals he uses to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery which produces that light, so we</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the conclusion that the artificial light</seg><seg type="columnLine">he uses is also natural. In the same way</seg><seg type="columnLine">telepathy is, under a given set of conditions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite normal and natural, and in our present</seg><seg type="columnLine">environment telepathy might be considered ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal but never unnatural. Man in the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of evolution may come to a stage where en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vironment and natural conditions will make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spoken word insufficient or even impossible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he would naturally turn to telepathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a substitute for speech. Such a transition</seg><seg type="columnLine">might require centuries to take place, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels of evolution turn slowly; still I am of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opinion that such a transition is at least a</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility, whereas your correspondent con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tends that telepathy will never be used, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnatural.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In conclusion I must tell you that A.

I think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have some fine writers who turn out an</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent group of stories, but after considering</seg><seg type="columnLine">them I would like to know if your stories are</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific or just some adventure stories with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific setting. I especially refer to Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith's tales. I will not deny that they are some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most interesting and exciting stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I have ever read, but the science in them</seg><seg type="columnLine">is used only to produce a thrilling story, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to expound any ideas, or to give information;</seg><seg type="columnLine">in other words, I think that he takes too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the science in his stories for granted. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">applies to most of the rest of your authors also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I just used Dr. Smith as an outstanding ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have before me the third installment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Terror Out of Space." This story is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the most plausible stories of Science-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fiction that I have ever read. The main points</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its favor are that it does not assume that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth is victorious in all things, or even that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is better than average; it just gives it as is</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaves all the super-science to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet that might very possibly have it. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">other planet does not come in and invade the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth in order to be gallantly defeated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero in the nick of time;. instead, it comes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">much the same way as the white men "helped''</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indians, with the exception that Mars is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good deal more fair. Finally, the hero is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a super-scientist, and does not frustrate all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies' plans; instead, he is a quite human</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who is content to take the back seat when</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary-. Altogether it is a thoroughly en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyable, plausible story that is being enjo&gt;*ed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by yours truly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">My last point concerns the much discussed</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory of time travel. For some months I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been trying to formulate a convincing argument</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was much gratified when I found it in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Jameson stories (incidentally, let me say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I enjoyed them very much). I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that physical time travel is impossible because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its absurdity. For example: supposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">you invent a time machine and go back fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years into the past, meet your parents when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were children, and kill them. Then you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never have been bora, you wouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented the machine, and therefore you wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have killed them. You see how silly it is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now if you went into the future, discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a certain man would change the destiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the human race, went back and killed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents before he was bora, and thus contra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicted the future, it would be just as bad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, if you believe that you can travel imo</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past, it certainly follows that you believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that people who have died are still alive, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                      Robert Dentsch,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                    5108 Kimbark Ave.,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                             Chicago, 111.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (We feel that you are perfectly right, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously so, in what you say about time-travel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it has given a basis for some very good</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories.

For instance, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">reader (Mrs. Buller) expresses a dislike for</seg><seg type="columnLine">"mush," "sex stuff/' "cruelty" and "supersti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion." She wrote, however, with the intention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of keeping these evils out of your stories. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">all due apologies to the lady, I must say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mush, in the hands of skillful authors, can be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come pathos.

Apologizing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Buller again, my opinion is that young</seg><seg type="columnLine">readers who must be sheltered from such in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluences are in the minority.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly enjoy "heavy drama," but between</seg><seg type="columnLine">killings a little chuckle doesn't go amiss. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">Editors realize of course, that only a small por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of your readers write you, but your only</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of judging their likes or dislikes is by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters you receive, Therefore, I hereby resolve</seg><seg type="columnLine">to write and tell you when I like a story, else</seg><seg type="columnLine">the majority of lazy satisfied readers may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruled by the few who like to write!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now for science.

In my opinion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the science fiction writer has an almost--no an</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely--unlimited field. The wildest dreams</seg><seg type="columnLine">are possible plots. Very good stories can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">written without an iota of science to back them</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. For instance, I remember "The Finger in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Past" in the November 1932 issue was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly impossible and unscientific, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusing and good reading.

Jules Verne's stories in par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular were an abomination--his fiction i3</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopelessly old-fashioned. Reading his stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">is about as thrilling as reading about a journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a Ford--written in a tone of awe at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical marvels of said Ford. And yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">each issue I dread seeing you announce, tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphantly, that at last you are going to pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish that masterpiece of Science Fiction, "20,-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">000	Leagues under the Sea".</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the last two issues you have two stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Poe.

From the tone of the letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your column of discussions, your readers</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not illiterate. It is reasonably certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of your readers have read the works of</seg><seg type="columnLine">so eminent an author as Poe. The very fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they read the type of stories you publish</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your magazine makes this certain. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking from experience. One of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">volumes I selected for my library was a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete "Poe".
