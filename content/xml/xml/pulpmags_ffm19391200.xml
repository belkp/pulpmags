It was a warm evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">late in August, and I was sitting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kitchen steps of my Chappaquiddick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island farmhouse, discussing the drought</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one of the farm hands. Suddenly there</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in the sky over our heads a flam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fiery mass, rushing straight downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's where a shooting star gets me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought, as I instinctively ducked my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, just as though such a feeble move</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ducking one's head could afford any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">possible protection from the flaming ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror. The next instant there came a dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash, followed by silence, which in turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">was broken by the hired man dryly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marking: "I reckon she struck over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cow Hill." Cow Hill was the slight ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vation just back of our farmhouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the meteor hadn't been aimed ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly as me, after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If that thing had hit me, some one else</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be giving to the world this story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We did nothing further about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor that night, being pretty well shaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">up by the occurrence. But next morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as the chores were done, the hired</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and I hastened to the top of Cow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Copyrighted, 1921. by The Frank A.

Every spear of grass was singed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the top of the hill; the big rock on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the summit showed marks of a collision;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and several splinters of some black igneous</seg><seg type="columnLine">material were lying strewed around. Lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the big rock there ran down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep side of the hill a gradually deepen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing furrow, ending in a sort of caved-in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We could not let slip such a good oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to get some newspaper publicity for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our farm. And so on the following Thurs-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day a full account of the meteoric visita-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion appeared in the Vineyard Gazette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the result that quite a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">summer folks walked across the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bathing beach to look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there was another result, for early</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following week I received a letter from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Gerrish, of the Harvard Ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servatory, stating that he had read about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meteor in the paper, and requesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">that 1 send him a small piece--or, if pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, the whole meteor--by express, col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lect, for purposes of analysis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anything for dear old Harvard! Unfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately all the black splinters had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried away by tourists. So I set the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to work digging out the main body. Quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hole was dug before we came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor, a black pear-shaped object about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size of a barrel. With rock tongs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains and my pair of Percherons we</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged this out onto the level. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped that it would be small enough so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could send the whole thing up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harvard and perhaps have it set up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the Agassiz Moseum, marked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bronze plate bearing my name; but its</seg><seg type="columnLine">size precluded this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My wife, who was present when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled it out, remarked: "It looks just</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a huge black teardrop or raindrop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And sure enough it did. But why not?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If raindrops take on a streamline form in</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling, why might not a more solid meteor</seg><seg type="columnLine">do so as well? But I had never heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one doing so before. This new idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompted me to take careful measurements</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to submit them to Professor O. D.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kellogg, of the Harvard mathematics de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment, who was summering at West</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chop near by. He reported to me that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form was as perfectly streamlined as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was possible to conceive, but that my sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mise as to how it had become so was ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE making these measurements</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was attracted by another feature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the meteor. At one place on the side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtless where it had struck the big rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black coating had been chipped away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disclosing a surface of yellow metal un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derneath. Also there was to be seen in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal an absolutely straight crack, extend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as far as the metal was exposed, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewise direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the time the crack did not attract</seg><seg type="columnLine">me so much as the metal. I vaguely won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if it might not be gold. But, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded of Professor Gerrish's request</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a sample of the meteor, I had one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men start chiseling off some pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The natural spot to begin was alongside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the place where the covering was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">chipped. It was hard work, but finally he</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed several pieces, and then we no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed that the crack continued around the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">waist of the meteor as far as had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">chipped. This crack, from its absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularity, gave every indication of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">man-made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our curiosity was aroused. Why the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularity of this crack? How far did it</seg><seg type="columnLine">go? Could it possibly extend clear way</seg><seg type="columnLine">around? Was it really a threaded joint?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if so, how could such a phenomenon</seg><seg type="columnLine">occur on a meteorite dropped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forgotten was the second crop mowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had planned to do that day. Hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoning the rest of the help, we set to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work with cold chisels and sledges, to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">move the black coating in a circle around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the huge teardrop. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and tedious task, for the black sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance was harder than anything I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever chipped before. We broke several</seg><seg type="columnLine">drills and dented the yellow metal unmerci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, but not so much so but what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that the threaded crack did actu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally persist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dinner hour passed, and still we</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked, unmindful of the appeals of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">womenfolk, who finally abandoned us with</seg><seg type="columnLine">much shrugging of shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was nearly night when we completed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chipping and applied two chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenches to try and screw the thing apart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, after all our efforts, it would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">budge. Just as we were about to drop the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenches and start to chisel through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal some one suggested that we try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unscrew it as a left-handed screw. Happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I For, in spite of all the dents</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had made, the two ends at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually untwisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What warrant did we have to suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was anything inside it? I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">confess, now it is all over, that we went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through this whole day's performance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of feverish trance, with no definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">notion of what we were doing, or why;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet impelled by a crazy fixed idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were on the verge of a great discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And at last our efforts had met with</seg><seg type="columnLine">success, and the huge teardrop lay before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in two neatly threaded parts.

I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time regaining my senses, but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had finally and fully recovered I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself lying on a, sandy beach, beside a</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm and placid lake, and holding in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand the small blue vase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The atmosphere was warm, moist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragrant, like that of a hothouse, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lap-lapping of the waves gave forth such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pleasing musical sound that I lay where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was and dozed off and on, even after</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had recovered consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I seemed to sense, rather than really</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see, my surroundings.

The sky was completely over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouded at a far height, and yet the clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone with such a silvery radiance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day was as bright as any which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen with full sunlight on earth, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a difference, for here the light diffused</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all quarters, giving the shadowless</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect which one always notes in a pho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tographer's studio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To my right lay the lake, reflecting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silvery color of the sky. Before me</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched the beach, unbroken save for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional piece of driftwood. To my left</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the upland, covered with a thicket of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what at first appeared to be dead trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but on closer scrutiny were seen to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">some gigantic species of the well-known</seg><seg type="columnLine">branched gray lichen with red tips, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I used to find on rocks and sticks in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods as a child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No birds were flying overhead, I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">because there were no birds to fly. I fell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to wondering, vaguely and pleasantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I was and how I got there; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the moment I remained a victim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete amnesia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, however, my ears were jarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a familiar sound. At once my senses</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared and I listened intently to the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant purring of a motor. Yes, there could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no mistake--an airplane was approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Now I could see it, a speck in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, far down the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nearer and nearer it came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sprang to my feet, and to my intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise found that the effort threw me</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a distance into the air. Instantly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought flashed through my mind: "I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be on Mars!" But no, for my weight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not nearly enough lighter than my earthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight to justify such a conclusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some reason my belt buckle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the buttons which held my clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">together were missing, so that my cloth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing came to pieces as I arose, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shed it rapidly in order to avoid im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peding my movements. I wondered at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But my speculations were cut short by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the alighting of the airplane a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards down the beach. It seemed to land</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertically, rather than run along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, but I could not be sure at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance. What was my horror when out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it clambered not men but ants! Ants, six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">footed and six feet high. Huge ants, four</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, running toward me over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening sands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gone was all my languor as I seized a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of driftwood and prepared to defend</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself as well as I could. The increase in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my jumping ability, although slight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupled with an added buoyancy, enabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to prolong the unequal encounter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ants came slowly forward, four</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast, like a cavalry formation, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I awaited their onslaught, grasping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick of driftwood firmly in my hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When nearly upon me they executed right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by-troopers and started circling in an ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowing circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the ants wheeled and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verged from all four points of the compass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">clicking their mandibles savagely as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. The whole movement had been exe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuted with uncanny precision, without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single word of communication between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange black creatures; in fact, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a single sound except the clicking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mandibles and a slight rattling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their joints. How like a naval attack by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fleet of old-fashioned Ford cars, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When within about ten feet of me, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a concerted rush; but I leaped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side, at the same time giving one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my antagonists a crack with my club as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they crashed together in the center. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">denouement seemed to confuse them, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they slowly extricated themselves from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tangle and withdrew for a short dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, where they again formed and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">glaring at me for a few minutes, clicking</seg><seg type="columnLine">their jaws angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they rushed again, this time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">close formation, but again I jumped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side, dealing another blow with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">club. Whereupon the fighting became dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">organized, the ants making individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushes, and I leaping and whacking as</seg><seg type="columnLine">best I could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I scored several dents in the armor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my opponents, and finally succeeded by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky stroke in beheading one of them. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this the other three came on with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">newed vigor. Although each ant wore some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of green weapon slung in a holster</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its side, they fought only with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandibles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The slight difference in gravity from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which I had been accustomed finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved my undoing; for, although it in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased my agility, it also rendered me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit less sure on my feet, and this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enhanced by the rapid disintegration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soles of my shoes. The result was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last I slipped and fell, and was immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately set upon and pinned down by my</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies. One of the ants at once deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately nipped me in the side with his huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandibles. An excruciating pain shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through my entire body; and then, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second time that day, I lost conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I came to, I found myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying in the cockpit of an airplane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding through the sky. One of my ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">captors was standing on a slight incline</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bow of the ship, operating the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol levers with his front feet; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other two were watching the scenery. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead ant was nowhere to be seen. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was paying any attention to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was not bound, and yet I was unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move. My senses were unusually keen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet my body was completely para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyzed. I had no idea as to what sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">country we were flying over, for I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise my head above the edge of the cock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit. I didn't know where I was going, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I certainly was on my way all right. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so all right, at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Overhead was the same silvery glare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a patch of blue sky. No sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from my sinister, indifferent captors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The only noise was the throbbing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to the time of day, or how long</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had been on board, I had no idea; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was more, I didn't particularly care.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rather a pleasant sort of a jag, if it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not for the intense pain of lickering-up..</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while the pleasant sensation wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, and my throat began to feel dry. I tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call to the ants, but of course could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, because of the paralysis; and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">desisted even the attempt when I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered that the ants were speechless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hence probably unable to hear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By a coincidence, however, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures seemed to sense my needs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me some water in a bowl, gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding up my head with one of his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paws so that I could drink. This action</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched my heart, and also filled me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope that the ants might not turn out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be such bad captors after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I fell to studying them. First of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, I noticed that each ant carried on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of his thorax a line of peculiar white</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters, somewhat like shorthand writ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting; and below it several rows of similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing, only smaller in size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The peculiar green-colored weapon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slung in a holster on the right-hand side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">each ant, I had already noticed during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight. But, apart from the white marks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the green weapons, my captors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely naked; and so far as I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were exactly like the ordinary black</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants to which I had been accustomed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, only of course magnified to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I studied the faces which the ants now</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally turned toward me. These faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sinister and terrifying. They recalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my memory the fright which I had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">had when, as a child, I attended an ento-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mological movie and was suddenly con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronted with a close-up of the head of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">common insect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the ant who had brought me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water had a human look which relieved him</seg><seg type="columnLine">of much of his terrible grimness. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he struck me as vaguely familiar. Ah! Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had it! A certain stolidity of movement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amounting almost to a mannerism, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded me of one of my Harvard class-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mates, a homely, good-hearted boy whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had all known by the nickname of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Doggo." And so, from then on, I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively thought of that particular ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">as named Doggo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, for the first time, it struck me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as strange that these ants, instead of scut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling aimlessly over the ground, or having</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings of their own to fly with, as in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mating season on earth, were utilizing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully and scientifically built airplane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently of their own make. And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck me as even more strange that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wondered about this before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But then the events of that day had oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred with such startling rapidity--from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flash in my Beacon Street laboratory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through my awakening beside that strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake, the approach of the airplane, my fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ants, and my second lapse from</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness, down to my present predica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment--that I was to be excused for not</seg><seg type="columnLine">considering any particular phase of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventures as being more extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, however, that I had had time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw my breath and collect my thoughts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it dawned on me with more and more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">force that here I was, apparently on some</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange planet of which the ruling race,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently of human or superhuman in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligence, were not men. And they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even some other mammal, but were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects--ants, to be more specific. For all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I knew, I was the only mammal--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps even vertebrate--on this entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I remembered a remark by Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Parker in Zoology I in my freshman</seg><seg type="columnLine">year at Harvard: "The two peaks of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopment, in the chain of evolution from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amoeba upward, are the order of hy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menoptera (bees, wasps and ants) among</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects, and the order of primates (men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and monkeys) among mammals. In any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other world it is probable that evolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">would produce a ruling race, in much the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same way that man has been produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the earth; and it is a toss-up whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mling race would develop along the *</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of the hymenoptera, or in a form</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to the mammals; but one or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other seems inevitable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said I to myself, "old Parker</seg><seg type="columnLine">is certainly vindicated, at least with respect</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one planet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus I mused, as the airplane sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">along. Then the purr of the motors lulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to sleep, and for the third time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day I became unconscious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I awoke the sky was losing its</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous silver quality. On one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was faintly pink, and on the other the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver color merged into a duller gray. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">airship still sped along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doggo brought me another bowl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and I found, to my joy, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could now iift my head enough to drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any further assistance than to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have Doggo hold the bowl. At this sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of recovery, one of the other ants ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced menacingly as if to bite me again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Doggo jumped between us, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">much snapping of mandibles and quivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of antenna by both, the other ant de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This event decided me that Doggo was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friend worth cultivating, but I was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a loss how to make advances which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be understood. Finally, however, I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to attempt stroking the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant in a way which I had found to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">very effective in making friends with ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly, when Doggo came near</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, by a great effort I overcame my</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralysis sufficiently to reach up and touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on the side of his head just behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his great jaws. Apparently this</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased the ant, for he submitted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caress, and finally lifted me to a sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">position, so that the patting could be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued with greater ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I later learned that this patting, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had resorted purely by accident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a universal custom of this planet, corre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponding to shaking hands on earth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">signifying greetings, friendship, farewell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bargain binding, and the like.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other ant man occasionally would</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance menacingly toward me with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head lowered, but each time Doggo would</seg><seg type="columnLine">step between us, lower his own head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">agitate his antenna, at which the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">would desist. I nicknamed the other Satan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of his diabolical actions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In my new sitting position I was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to see over the side of the airship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were passing above gray woods, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional silver-green fields, in which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazing some sort of pale green animals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too far below to be easily distinguishable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the woods and fields ran what</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be roads, but as nothing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving on them, I could not tell for sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly my attention was distracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the view by the frantic action of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant man who was steering the ship. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be having difficulty with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls. And then, so quickly that it gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">us no warning, the ship reared up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and made a complete loop. That is,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I merely suppose it made a complete one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for when the loop was half done, I dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and fell like a plummet through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remember a momentary exultation at</seg><seg type="columnLine">being free from my captors, and a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiteful joy at the thought that'l should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">undoubtedly be dashed to pieces and thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">rob them of their prey. Then I had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun to wonder whether I shouldn't pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fer captivity to death, when I struck- -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And was not dashed to pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I still lived, for I had been thrown slant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise into a net of some sort, and was how</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying gently back and forth like a slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pendulum. Hooray! I was both fref</seg><seg type="columnLine">and safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But my joy was short lived, for I soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that the fine silken strands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the net were covered with a substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">like sticky fly paper, which held me firmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The more I struggled, the more I drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">other strands of the net toward me to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle me. At last I paused for breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the truth dawned on me: I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in a gigantic spider web! And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure enough, there came the spider toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from one corner of the web.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He wasn't a very large spider. That is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say, judging by the size of my previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">captors, I should have expected that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiders of this world would be as big as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eifel Tower. He was quite large enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, having a body about the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my own, and legs fully ten feet long.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I call him a "spider," for that is the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">word which comes closest to describing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With great assiduity he began wrapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">me up into a cocoon, a process which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to enjoy much more than I. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did me no good to struggle, for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of me which showed any indications</seg><seg type="columnLine">of moving was immediately pinioned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fresh strand of rope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last the job was finished, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely enveloped with a layer of thick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarse, sticky silk cloth, translucent, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not transparent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUT OF THE FRYING PAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I had dropped from the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane into the spider web, the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been nearly evening. All night, off and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, I struggled, but to no avail. Finally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly after daylight, something startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me by falling--plop--into the net close</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me. Another victim, thought I. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least I should have company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this other creature was not any more</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined to take its captivity calmly than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been. It thrashed and struggled vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently, until finally it tore a rent in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper end of my shroud, so that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My companion in misery was an orange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-black-striped bee about the size of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse. He was buzzing frantically and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slashing about with his sting, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider hopped around him with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">agility, dodging the thrusts of the sting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and applying a strand of silk here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, whenever an opportunity offered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus gradually the bee's freedom of mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion became less and less, as strand after</seg><seg type="columnLine">strand were added to his bonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the spider, getting bolder as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">captive's struggles diminished, finally mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged one thrust; and the imprisoned bee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting all his effort into the stroke, drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sting home. The spider toppled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the web, and the fight was unexpectedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now the bee and I were free, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we only could get free. Of the two of us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had the easier task, for my cocoon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dried during the night and was now no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer sticky. But it was still very tough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, inch by inch, biting, clawing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tearing, I gradually enlarged the hole near</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head, until finally I was able to step</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and jump to the ground, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ten feet away, a drop equivalent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a little less than eight feet on the earth;</seg><seg type="columnLine">not much difference, it is true, but every</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bit helped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I now decided to assist my rescuer, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bee, to escape. A rash decision, one would</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, and yet the bee seemed to realize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was helping him, for not once did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike at me. Picking up a tree branch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hacked at the cords which bound him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until finally he was able to fly away, trail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a large section of the web after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he left, I noticed that one fif his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind legs was gone from the knee down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that he bore a peculiar scarlike mark</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the under side of his abdomen. I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">know him, if ever I were to meet him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The web had been stretched between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two large gray leafless trees of the sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had observed near the beach, but with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the red tips to the branches. Near by</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a wood of similar but slightly smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, bordering on a field of thickly matted</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver-green grass, very similar to earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass, except in color. In this field were</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazing a herd of pale green insects a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger than sheep with long trailing an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenna.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These creatures swayed from side to</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, lifting first one foot after another as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they munched the matted grass. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of some of them clung one or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright red parasites, resembling lobsters in</seg><seg type="columnLine">size and appearance; but their green hosts</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem to mind or even notice them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor did they notice me, for that matter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I passed between them across the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the further side of the field was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, built of concrete, resembling in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">way such concrete roads as we have on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth; and along it I set out, whither</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, I had had nothing to eat since</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found myself on the sandy beach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous morning. Also I had fought two</seg><seg type="columnLine">battles on an empty stomach. The day was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot and moist, my feet were bare--as was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of me--and I felt discouraged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">depressed. Still, I trudged along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can it be true," said I, '"that only</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday I rejoiced at freedom from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant men?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I was alone and lost--lost on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange planet.

On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaunt gray trees hung a tangle of tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">vines, and between the trees grew some</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of small shrub with large heart-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves, on each leaf of which there sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless one or more purple grasshop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers about four inches in length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the distance I occasionally caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of some strange sort of bird--as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought--flitting in tandem pairs from</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree to tree. A multitude of tiny lizards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling miniature kangaroos, hopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">about on the concrete and by the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a while the strange fauna and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flora stimulated my curiosity and kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind off my troubles; but then I rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly lost interest in everything. My stom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ach gnawed. My knees wabbled. My mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to cloud. And from that time on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wandered as in a dream, for I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">not how many hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I vaguely remember falling on the road-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and then crawling along for a while.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silly thoughts obsessed my brain, such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering whether my tail light was lit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what made the weather so foggy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally I collapsed utterly, and had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength enough to drag myself off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concrete lest I be run over by some pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I lay there in the bushes by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the road, there came to my nostrils</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smell which partially revived me--a smell</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly of griddle cakes and maple</seg><seg type="columnLine">syrup. Opening my eyes again and follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my nose, I discovered that this pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant odor emanated from a large bowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped leaf only a few feet away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon dragging myself toward it, I dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that in the bottom of the bowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a brown mass, looking very much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like a stack of wheats, covered with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticky substance. But unfortunately this</seg><seg type="columnLine">delectable dish was quite obscured by little</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopping lizards, now much bemired and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopping no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I reached out my hand to brush them</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and instantly the leaf closed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arm like a steel trap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My brain cleared at once, and I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frantic struggle to extricate my hand;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was too late, for with a gentle mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saging motion the plant commenced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallow my arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inch by inch my arm descended into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rapacious maw.

Satan did not seem overjoyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see me, but Doggo rummaged through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wreckage and finally produced a bowl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into which he put water and some medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cine, which revived me greatly. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid me on a pile of grass, covered me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves, and stood guard over me as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink twilight deepened and the night fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it began to grow dark I could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">an occasional tinkle like the sound of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japanese wind bell, first on one side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then on another. This music gradually in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased, until it assumed the volume of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fairy orchestra. I had never heard such</seg><seg type="columnLine">dainty, bewitching tunefulness in my entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. Many weeks later I learned that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the song of the large purple grass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoppers I had seen; but even the knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of its source has never robbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of its sweet mystery for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fading silver radiance of the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed a moonlike light over all below. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint breeze sprang up, gently fanning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moist, fragrant, hot-house air against</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">my cheeks. The foliage around us waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a sea of silver grain. And the tune</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that elfin melody quickly lulled me into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a soft and dreamless sleep, secure in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence that a faithful friend was watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing near.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next morning I was awakened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doggo stripping off my leafy coverlet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Satan was not to be seen, but grazing near</seg><seg type="columnLine">us were some more of those peculiar large</seg><seg type="columnLine">green insects, with long trailing antenna,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had seen in my flight from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider web.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I sat up, Doggo presented me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bowl of pale green liquid.

The passage was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long, narrow, dark and winding, but pres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ently we emerged into a room about thirty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feet square by ten feet high, lighted by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">narrow windows opening toward the west-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ern sky.

Then they walked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">several times around me, viewing me from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all sides with evident interest, until, at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a stiffening and quivering of Doggo's an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tenna, they hurriedly left the room. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">noticed that Doggo no longer carried the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">green weapon, which seemed strange, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he was very evidently on guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then I fell to wondering about the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">couch. It was a simple affair, and yet quite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">evidently intended for a bed. Upholstered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with some kind of dark blue cloth, at that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What need have ants of a bed?" mused</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I. "Certainly they cannot lie down; and,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even if they could, such a couch as this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be of little use to one of them, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this is only a man-size couch, whereas these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ants are about ten feet in length!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  My perplexity was tinged with a hope</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that there might be human beings here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My perplexity and my hope were both</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased by the return of one of the ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">wha. had brought the couch, this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing a sleeveless shirt or toga of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">matted material, like very thin silk felt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching about to my knees, with a Grecian</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave design in light blue around the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom edge and around the neck and arm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes. But what increased my perplexity</seg><seg type="columnLine">still further, and at the same time de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed most of my hope, was the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two vertical slits, with the same blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">trimming, in the upper part of the back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two ant man watched with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest while I put this toga on, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently pleased to find that I knew how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do so. The messenger ant then with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew. and presently returned with a bowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green milk, which I drank as usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  By this time it had become quite dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, but the room still remained light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to two long glass bulbs, set in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling, and containing some sort of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">candescent substance. At that time I little</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed what a part those bulbs would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to play in my life! They resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercury vapor lamps; except that, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of shining with a marked purple or</seg><seg type="columnLine">green light, they gave forth a radiance</seg><seg type="columnLine">indistinguishable from daylight, doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to the substitution of some other gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">for mercury vapor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  These lamps showed that the inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this planet were well advanced in elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trical engineering.

Ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent-mindedly I started to time the right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand pointer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One chimpanzee.

The pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vailing color of the foliage was gray and</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver green. Many of the twigs bore knobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of red or purple, and a few of the plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brilliantly colored blue and yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers somewhat similar to those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dandelions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time I aimlessly gazed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">this beautiful garden.

But finally even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beauties of the view palled upon me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I returned to the blue couch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then Doggo ushered into the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">with great deference, four ant men slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller than himself, but more refined</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking than he, if one can appreciate such</seg><seg type="columnLine">differences among ants. That is, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">more slender and delicate, like machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">built for precision rather than for strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They evidently were a bit afraid of me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">for after eying me furtively from the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">they appeared to confer with Doggo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though not an audible word passed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them.

They counted my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers several times, and then counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">my toes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the thing about me which amazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the most was my ears. These they</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied for a long time, with much in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">audible consultation, as I judged by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motions of their antenna.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally they took their departure, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doggo came to me bristling with excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and apparently having much im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant information to impart; but, alas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not know my language, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no language at all. I patted him again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this time it did not soothe him, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he broke away from me impatiently and</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to his station by the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LEFT to myself, I fell to studying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meter again, watching the counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clockwise rotation of its hands.

Then I counted chimpanzees again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found that the right hand pointer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still rotating counterclockwise at the rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of about fifty chimpanzees per graduation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Counterc/oc&amp;wise! Why, perhaps this ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine was a clockI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made a hasty mental calculation: "One</seg><seg type="columnLine">graduation equals fifty seconds. Twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">graduations--one complete rotation--equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">six hundred seconds--ten minutes. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">one graduation of the middle dial repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sents ten minutes, and its complete circuit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">represents two hours. By the same token,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a complete circuit of the left dial would</seg><seg type="columnLine">represent twenty-four hours--one day!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My guess was apparently correct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At that time it did not occur to me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange that a day on this planet should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be twenty-four hours as on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The figure to the left of the top of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">dial was a single horizontal line, presum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably standing for unity; for a single line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either horizontal or vertical, is the almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">universal symbol for unity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''Then," said I, "the next figure must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be two, the next figure three, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">on around to twelve. Eureka! I can now</seg><seg type="columnLine">count up to twelve with these creatures;</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus establishing, in writing at least, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of a possible basis of communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eager to test my newfound knowledge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I beckoned to Doggo. He came to my side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Scratching the ant figure five upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor with a small pebble which I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a corner--for I could not reach the dials</seg><seg type="columnLine">to point to their figures--I held up five</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. The effect was electrical. Greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited, Doggo rushed to the door. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pausing on the threshold, he returned; held</seg><seg type="columnLine">up three legs, looking at me almost be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seechingly, as I thought; and, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote an ant figure three on the floor, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy knew no bounds. He patted me on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of my head for a moment, to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">his appreciation, and then rushed once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more from the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And now, for the first time, I was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">unguarded, but I had no thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape; in the first place, because it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be unfair to my friend; and in the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond, because escape merely from the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be useless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently Doggo returned with the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittee of four, and put me through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">paces. He would hold up a certain num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of legs, and I would scratch the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">responding character upon the pavement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, as a crowning stunt, I wrote down</seg><seg type="columnLine">five and six, pointed to them, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote down eleven. The committee were</seg><seg type="columnLine">much impressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then Doggo had me put on and take ofl</seg><seg type="columnLine">my toga for them. Evidently he was try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to convince them I was a reasoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">human being like themselves, though what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disrobing performance had to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it I could not see for the life of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the committee left, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a very nice luncheon was served;</seg><seg type="columnLine">more green milk, some baked cakes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">honey. Real, honest to goodness honey, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have on earth! You can't appreciate</seg><seg type="columnLine">how these little touches of similarity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">good old terra firma appealed to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly homesick after three whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">days' absence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After luncheon, Doggo brought me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pad of paper and a pointed stick like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">skewer, with its tip incased in some lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like metal. This stick could thus be used</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a pencil. He himself was similarly</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped, except that his pencil had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strap for attachment to his left front claw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The difference between the two pencils</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted my attention and excited my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder, but I could hot account for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Instruction began at once. I would point</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some object; Doggo would make marks</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his pad; and then I would copy them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on mine, adding the name in English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These additions puzzled and annoyed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructor; but I persisted, for otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might early forget the meaning of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratch marks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When a vocabulary of about twenty con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crete nouns had been accumulated, Doggo</seg><seg type="columnLine">took away my sheet, and then pointed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the articles in turn, while I wrote down</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ant names, as well as I could re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member them. Fortunately I have a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">visual memory, for I was no more able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to invent sounds for the ant words, than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have been able to read aloud a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinese laundry ticket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After several hours of this absorbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sport, Doggo produced a book! With rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of mind, I figure that as ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">men wrote with their left hands and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">counterclockwise clocks, their books would</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably begin at the wrong end; so ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordingly I opened at the back. And, sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, the last page was numbered one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This proof of my intelligence pleased my</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructor greatly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On page one was the picture of an ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Under it was printed the word which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doggo had given me as equivalent to him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Next came the same word, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a strange word. Then these two words</seg><seg type="columnLine">were repeated, followed by two others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reasoning by the analogy of my primary</seg><seg type="columnLine">school days at home, I decided that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">words were: "Ant man. An ant man. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is an ant man." But I was wrong, for on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this basis, the next line made no sense;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, reading from right to left the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">line would be: "An ant man is this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, I had it! "Ant man. The ant man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I see the ant man. The ant man sees me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">To test it, I wrote down the word for</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I," and pointed to myself. Doggo, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been watching me intently as I studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the page, now showed unmistakable signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pleasure at this evidence of my intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence; and, departing, soon returned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large, furry, beetlelike creature about</seg><seg type="columnLine">two feet square, called a "buntlote"--so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I learned later--which he set on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me with every expectation of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treme gratitude on my part. I tried to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear grateful; but could not figure out</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I was supposed to do with the beast!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The buntlote, however, had much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite views on the subject, for he ambled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to me and patted me on the side with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his front paws. I looked inquir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly at Doggo, who indicated that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to feed the buntlote with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the remains of my luncheon, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still sitting on the couch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE buntlote, after satisfying his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger, curled up in a corner and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep, whereupon I returned to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">studies. Evidently ant men kept pets the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same as humans; but whether this bunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lote was suppoiid to be a dog, or a cat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or what, I did not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doggo then taught me how to write</seg><seg type="columnLine">"buntlote," and the words for food, mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eat--my first verb, by the way--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By supper time I was in a position to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry on a very elementary conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my instructor, but only by pad and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencil, of course, for not a word or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound had I ever heard him utter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And since their speech was not articu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">late, their written language could not, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, be phonetic. It must be ideo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphic, like the Chinese. The fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">each word consisted in but a single char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acter lent color to this surmise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet I noticed that all of the char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acters which I had so far learned could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be decomposed into distinguishable parts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that there were only about thirty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these parts in the aggregate. This fact cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly pointed to a phonetic alphabet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty sounds, for it was inconceivable that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these highly cultivated animals possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thirty ideas. And yet how could an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unspoken language be phonetic? I gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the puzzle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Supper came, the lights on, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">buntlote uncurled and ambled over to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed. I decided to regard him as a cat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so named him Tabby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this meal Doggo joined me, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we ate, my attention was again attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the white marks on his back, which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my surprise I now noticed were exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">like those on the clock. They must be his</seg><seg type="columnLine">license number: "334-2-18."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the large figures represented his li-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cense number, I thought, what did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small figures stand for? The license num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of the cars he had run into, perhaps?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I little guessed how near this came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">being the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night I went to bed well satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my progress. But, alas, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doggo proved to be an indefatigable</seg><seg type="columnLine">teacher, I did not get on so well during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the succeeding days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I did make progress in one thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however; namely, in acquiring a beard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although facilities for washing and bath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing were provided in a little alcove off my</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and although a fresh toga was forth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming from time to time, yet my captors</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not furnish either a razor or a mirror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course ants have nothing to shave, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they cannot be blamed for not caring to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at themselves in the glass. I tried my</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to explain to Doggo what I wanted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was no use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If this manuscript is ever discovered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the reader try to figure out how to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">explain by sign language to a person who</seg><seg type="columnLine">has never seen either a razor or a looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass, that you want them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the beard got well under way, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">committee of four were recalled to view it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were even more impressed with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard than they had been with my ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made frequent visits to take notes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its growth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This convinced me that they had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">before seen any men, or at least any unneat</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones, and so my hope for human compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ionship received another blow. Yet if there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no men on this planet, how account</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the fact that when I drew a sketch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a table and a chair these were at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthcoming, together with a written name</seg><seg type="columnLine">for each?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course all my time was not spent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessons. Sometimes I played with Tabby</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sometimes I took long walks. Gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally I became more of a guest than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner or even a curiosity, and so I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">given the run of the entire city, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">built as one large connected house; a verit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able jumble of rooms, passageways, ramps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and courtyards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this freedom nearly proved my un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day when I had strolled unusually</seg><seg type="columnLine">far from my own quarters, I met my old</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy, Satan, in one of the courtyards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instinctively I shrunk back, but he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">every indication of wishing to be friendly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to the extent of turning his head on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side to be patted. Distasteful as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">act was to me, I decided that discretion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the better part of valor, and so patted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him gingerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Apparently as a reward for this service,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he beckoned me to follow him. And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did, through many a winding corridor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our way finally led to the outskirts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, to a grating guarded by a sentinel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom Satan promptly relieved. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old guard had gone, Satan, to my great</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, opened the gate and motioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to step out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was indeed a favor, for, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had been able to get plenty of fresh air</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the courtyard flower gardens and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the roofs, yet I had felt cramped and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained, and had longed for the freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a run in the open fields. So, patting him</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, to show my gratitude, I rushed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned several handsprings for joy on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silver sward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I regained my feet, what should I</seg><seg type="columnLine">see to my dismay but a squad of ant men</seg><seg type="columnLine">issuing from the gate and rushing toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">me at full speed, with Satan at their head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his savage jaws snapping with hate. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood astounded for a moment, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At an earthly speed of running a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have little hope of distancing one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these creatures, but the added buoyancy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this strange planet gave me a slight ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage over them, until I had the mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune to stub my toe on something and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall. Whereupon the pack closed over me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fall stunned me, and as my brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened, I felt the sharp mandibles of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy fasten upon my throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A VISION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE full measure of Satan's perfidy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now evident. Under the guise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretended friendship he had lured me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city gate and had persuaded me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">step outside. Then hastily calling a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tachment of the guard, he had informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them that I had escaped. He had led them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in pursuit of me, and my flight had furn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished sufficient verification of his accusa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So now I was entirely in his power. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was free to kill me without fear of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequences, for the whole squad would back</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his story that I had fled and that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been forced to slay me for the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose of preventing my escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why he did not bite me at once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">end my life I do not know. Perhaps he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished first to gloat over me. At any rate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after I came out of my daze, he lbosened</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hold on my throat and, planting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">front feet upon my prostrate body, threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head aloft, as if singing a pean of vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, although of course no sound came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly he sprang away from me</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely. And now I discovered the mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and use of the peculiar green weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which every ant man carried slung in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster at his side when out of doors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These supposed weapons were nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more nor less than green umbrellas which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Satan and the others were now hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting up in very evident terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting up weakly, I tried to figure out</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had so frightened them as to cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to desist abruptly from their at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack on me. But I could discern nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">except a patch of sunlight, the very first</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had seen, by the way, since my advent on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet. My late antagonists were ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently watching this--to me--very</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant sight, with every indication of</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme fear. Looking above, I saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small bit of blue sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The patch of sunlight passed close by</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and proceeded toward a small herd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">green cows who were grazing near by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, as it passed among them, the shift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of their feet stopped, and every cow</seg><seg type="columnLine">on whom the light had rested shuddered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilted and dropped in evident agony upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I realized that this planet must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be very close to the center of the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">system, and protected from the intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat of the sun only by the dense, silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds which surround it. I was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly certain, as I had surmised before</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the prevailing silver-gray and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity slightly less than that on earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this must be the planet Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was still gazing abstractedly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken cows in the wake of the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat, when I was rudely called to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses by the ant pack closing over me</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more. And once again the mandibles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Satan fastened on my throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the best laid plans of mice and men</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and even ant men--gang aft aglee. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his clever scheming, Satan had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">one fatal mistake: he had reckoned with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the faithful Doggo. As Satan's jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">were about to pierce my jugular, again</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dropped me, and stood at attention,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if in response to a peremptory com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mand from a military superior. I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and saw that the rest of the guard were</seg><seg type="columnLine">also standing at attention, while rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching us from the city gate came</seg><seg type="columnLine">my old friend, Doggo, with antenna erect</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quivering. Once more he had saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How I regretted the blows which I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him in the fight at the beach on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">first day upon this planet, and how glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was that his had not been the head which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had severed in that spirited encounter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently, as if in response to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">command, Satan slunk away, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squad of ant soldiers returned to the city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Doggo came and stood solicitously</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my side. When I had rested sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rose to my feet, and together we returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was time for my lesson, but I was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no mood for study, so I gloomily pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the books and papers to one side and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood by one of the windows, gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimlessly at the beautiful garden below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It is always darkest before dawn. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there at the window, with my spirits</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a low ebb, there came to my eyes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision which changed the entire course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For, crossing the courtyard below me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was what seemed to be a human being 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here at last was some one for me to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But was it a human being, after all?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He, or she, or it, stopped just in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my window, and began daintily to pluck</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bouquet of flowers, so that I had ample</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to study the creature. It wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blue and white toga, similar to the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the ant man had furnished me. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now I saw the reason for the slits in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, for through them protruded a pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tiny rudimentary butterfly wings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">iridescent pearly hue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The complexion of this dainty creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a softer pink and white than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had seen on any baby. Its hair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely cropped and curly and brilliantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden. But the most attractive thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it was the graceful way in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it swayed and pirouetted, as if before a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror, though there was no mirror there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless in its own imagination. This pirouet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting, led me to suppose that the creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether human or not, was probably femi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Is there any more beautiful sight in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, or in any world for that matter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a beautiful girl admiring herself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">preening herself, and acting altogether na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tural and girlish, when she thinks that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">is alone and unobserved?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But was this a girl? She was pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to be an angel, or a fairy, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little wings suggested something along</seg><seg type="columnLine">that line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But then I began to notice certain other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things about her which puzzled me. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first place, she had an extra little finger on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each hand, and six toes on each of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare little feet, yet this fact did not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least detract from their dainty slimness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, too, there projected from her fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head two tiny antenna, such as one sees</seg><seg type="columnLine">on pictures of elves. Also she apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no ears. Anyhow, the lack of ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hardly noticeable, though the absence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little pink tip just barely showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the edge of short hair, did give</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slightly unfinished look to that part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Antenna and wings! This must be either</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fairy, or some new and beautiful kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of creature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She bore such a close resemblance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a human being, that my lonely spirit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheered by the thought that at last there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a possibility of speech and human</seg><seg type="columnLine">companionship on this planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So intent had I been on drinking in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision of beauty below my window that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had not noticed Doggo approach me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">place himself at my side. I was terribly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful lest the girl should go away with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out my finding out who she was and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might see her again. So, forgetting my</seg><seg type="columnLine">manners and even the fact that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an unknown race, I plucked up sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage to address her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear young lady," began I; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got no further, for without noticing me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the least, she picked up her flowers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RADIO MAN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">left the courtyard. Then I turned, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was Doggo standing beside me. So he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, had seen the fairy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seizing my pad and paper I wrote:</seg><seg type="columnLine">What is that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he replied: "It is a Cupian."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are there many Cupians?" I wrote.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Am I a Cupian?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His answer was: "We do not know. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzles us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT afternoon I made more progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my studies than I had made in</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks. For now I was no longer fitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself merely for a bare existence in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant civilization; but rather I was prepar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for communication with--and I hoped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">life among--creatures closely resembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beautiful Cupian was evidently, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ant menr devoid of hearing. Apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">she lived here in the ant city, and so un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly understood the ant language.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to make sure, I asked Doggo on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pad: "Do Cupians read and write this</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of writing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he answered: "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this I certainly did tackle my work</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a vim. It was clear now that if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to communicate with her, I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect myself in the written language of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ants; and so I set myself assiduously</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every day at about the same hour she</seg><seg type="columnLine">came and picked the blue and yellow flow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers and the red and purple twig knobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the garden below my window. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day I sat in the window and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and racked my brains for some tact-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful way in which to attract her attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course I raised the question with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doggo, but he kept putting me off by say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, in substance: "It is not yet time."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This I took to mean that I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet write fluently enough to converse with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and so I redoubled my efforts at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">studies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So rapid was my progress now_under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spur of my desire for human compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ionship, that within a very few days I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">able to graduate from my primers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">read real books.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the first real books which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me was a history of their world;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this interested me greatly, as it furn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished a setting for the experiences which</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly were to crowd upon me. The book</seg><seg type="columnLine">confirmed my theory that this world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silver planet, Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally I reached a point where my in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest was such that I could not wait to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wade further through the voluminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages; so, taking my pad and pencil, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Doggo: "Tell me briefly about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more recent events on Poros." For so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the planet, though of course, I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet know the sound of this word, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">even whether it had a sound. "Tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">more particularly about the great war."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he replied, also in writing, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course: "A little over five hundred years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago the entire inhabited part of the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poros, that is to say the continent which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is surrounded by the boiling sea, was di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided up into twenty or more warring</seg><seg type="columnLine">kingdoms of Cupians and one small queen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom of ant men, namely Formia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Formians, who were possessed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the virtues, became more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">vexed with the increasing degeneracy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their neighbors, until, for purely altruistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons, the Formians began a conquest to</seg><seg type="columnLine">extend their culture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the first convenient excuse of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered we declared war on one of the Cupian</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations, which we proceeded to attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the territory of a neutral state."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But wasn't this wrong?" I interjected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He admitted: "I suppose that you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and that it really was in violation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all treaties and of the solemn customs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet. But it was all in a noble</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The other nations did not have sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough," he continued, "to rally to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bat the common menace, and so the For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mians gradually conquered them one by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, until at last Formia was mistress of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all Poros.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There must have been some very able</seg><seg type="columnLine">statesmen in the Imperial Council at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">time, judging by the terms imposed by our</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquering nation.

I can't understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A glance convinced me that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. In less than a minute I saw a speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men literally grow under my eyes into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">full-fledged parameba. I can liken the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeding only to the coming of an ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject toward one, with all the attendant</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase in size that the movement im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PERHAPS I may make myself clearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I say that the restoration of para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meba, as I saw it then and many times</seg><seg type="columnLine">after, was like a railway train traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward one from the distance. At first a</seg><seg type="columnLine">far speck is visible; then the outline of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotive engine can be distinguished;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last a huge machine and thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cars threaten to crush one out of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that was not all. Parameba came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back alive! Every biologist and chemist</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed that baroturpinol was a deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison. At all events, I had noticed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when any microorganism was brought into</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact with even a trace of baroturpinol,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all activity ceased. Death seemed neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarily to precede the process of shrinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I could hardly believe my eyes when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw my resuscitated parameba moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">about with that characteristic tumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion by which it is so well known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What have you been doing?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Just what you told me to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Dear, dear Jeanne," I said, taking her</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. hands in mine. "Do you know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have made what may prove to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very important discovery in biology? Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know that you may have upset the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole theory of life?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She clapped her hands. But at the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wonderful scientific significance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what she had seen was lost to her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that I approved of her, and she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But what did this astonishing revival</seg><seg type="columnLine">of parameba mean? Over and over again I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched for the return of specimens under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the microscope. Parameba would not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn. I questioned Jeanne closely; I even</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched her prepare a few slides herself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping that she had unconsciously de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted from the routine that I had pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed and had contaminated the baro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turpinol in a way that would explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last she remembered. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the slide with a little glass rod</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to shift it on the stage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument. The rod did not seem clean.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She thought to improve matters by wip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it. A painstaking and conscientious</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory worker would have used a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sterile cotton. Jeanne used her pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief. It was clear enough that</seg><seg type="columnLine">that little piece of 'linen was strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">linked with the accidental revivification of</seg><seg type="columnLine">parameba.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  My deduction was confirmed when I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, experimented with the handkerchief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I deposited a single drop of stagnant water</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a clean glass slide. Under the powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">lens I saw parameba tumbling about. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I added a drop of baroturpinol (one gram</seg><seg type="columnLine">of barturpinol to a cubic centimeter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">distilled water is the proportion, as every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one knows), and at once all activity ceased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently killed, the specimens of para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meba began to shrink in that curious man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner upon which I had already dilated. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a glass rod and wiped it on Jeanne's</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief. First making sure that para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meba had quite disappeared, I touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little drop of moisture on the slide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DIMINISHING DRAFT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" 31</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">My guess was right.

Parameba came rushing back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">life as startlingly as at first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The handkerchief had been definitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">linked with the phenomenon, but I was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark as much as ever. What mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">properties had this little piece of fabric</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it should thus divert the whole course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of modern biochemistry?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me, Jeanne," I said, "did your</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief touch anything here--some</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I'm sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you must have done something</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it.

"I had been crying</seg><seg type="columnLine">at something that you said."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not stop to inquire what it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had said. A light dawned on me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">H^r tears had so uncannily brought back</seg><seg type="columnLine">parameba to life! And tears--what are</seg><seg type="columnLine">they, when stripped of all sentiment, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt water?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A spectroscopic analysis of Jeanne's</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief convinced me that common</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt" had the property of bringing back</seg><seg type="columnLine">parameba to life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dozens of experiments showed that al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most any solution of salt would answer;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stronger it was the more quickly did</seg><seg type="columnLine">life triumph over death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND now began an investigation which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a strange mixture of scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">research and love-making. To Jeanne it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a play. She was very much bored</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I would repeat tests perhaps twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five or fifty times simply to be sure of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">results. But when we experimented with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new organism, she was all eagerness, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing eyes and clapping hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Jeanne who made the discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the first place, and Jeanne who de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped its full possibilities. She had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-considered plan of work: she simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed her impulses, her girlish whims to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sway her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want things to happen," she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, as I tried to explain to her how Time-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasting was this unscientific, haphazard,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blind plunging into a new and unexplored</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. And yet, through her insatiable de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire for excitement, her dramatic interest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we found out what really happened when</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher organisms were subjected to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">action of baroturpinol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for me, I confined myself entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to simple-celled organisms, all so small</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they cannot be seen with the naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye. Here, I thought, was enough work to</seg><seg type="columnLine">engage me for years. But that was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">tame for Jeanne. She had the imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the daring that seem to accompany</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific ignorance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I kept a little aquarium in one corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the laboratory--a spawning glass jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fresh-water life. It was a never-ending</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of entertainment for her. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known her to sit for an hour at a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching crayfish crawl lazily along on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom, or a school of tiny goldfish</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting for a crumb that she had mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chievously tossed in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day--it was about two months after</seg><seg type="columnLine">she came to me--she ran to me all radiant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding a bowl at the bottom of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were two or three tiny golden flakes. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so small that I had to hold the bowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the window and view them by</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitted light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What have we here?" I asked, won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering what new fancy had seized her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goldfish," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense," I retorted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, they are," she insisted. "I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">some Japanese goldfish from the aquarium</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dropped them into baroturpinol, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they all shrank up like this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the original discovery of parameba's</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearance and return had startled me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how shall I describe the stupefaction that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this announcement called forth?

On the other hand I must say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was my academic timidity, if I may so</seg><seg type="columnLine">call it: my systematic way of proceeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepwise from one experiment to another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had led to the original misconception</seg><seg type="columnLine">of baroturpinol's effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To every physician and every biologist</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world, baroturpinol was simply a</seg><seg type="columnLine">germicide. True, Tilden, who had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered it, had noticed that it had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious puckering effect on living tissue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for which reason it had been condemned</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quite useless as a substitute for mercury</seg><seg type="columnLine">bichloride, phenol, and similar agents, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been adopted simply as a convenient</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cheap hospital sterilizer. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes my Jeanne, my capricious, dancing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">playful Jeanne, a mere trifier in science,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at once uncovers the hidden pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibilities of a completely misunderstood</seg><seg type="columnLine">compound, not because she is a biologist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but because she simply wants to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">amused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obviously it was my business to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out whether, like the microscopic organ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isms that I had thus far examined, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baroturpinoled goldfish would be revivified</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a solution of common salt. I decanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the liquid in the bowl, washed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inanimate, shimmering flakes in distilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and then filled the bowl with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution of salt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drama of parameba's return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">life was repeated on a more striking scale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very slowly the dead creatures began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">expand. Soon they assumed their normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes--not, I repeat, that they had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">them by shrinking, but simply that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curves of their bodies were developed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not until they had regained their full</seg><seg type="columnLine">size that life itself returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To me the thing was as startling as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man, who had been poisoned by prussic</seg><seg type="columnLine">acid, and who had been pronounced dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to open his eyes, get up, and walk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I took some pains to explain all this to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intensely amused Jeanne, and I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated the experiment with a particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">large goldfish which I abstracted from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">aquarium. I made no impression whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her. She promptly christened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish "Lazarus" when he came back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, and adopted him as a pet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This impulsiveness of hers, this reckless</seg><seg type="columnLine">disregard of all system and plan, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">this be a form of mental activity which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had been wrong in regarding rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazily as showing only an average order</seg><seg type="columnLine">of intellect? Some one has defined in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuition as a swift deduction from present</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts. If that be so--I am no psychologist</seg><seg type="columnLine">--then we must reckon with intuition as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as with the slower and more de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberate methods of reasoning in scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">research.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Jeanne was anything she was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuitive. I felt that I must credit her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers that were denied me. After all it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was she, and not I, who had stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the amazing action of baroturpinol. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done little beyond repeating her fanci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful experiments under rigorous scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">control.

We lost all</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-control. In the beginning we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained a semblance of formality. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept regular laboratory hours, coming in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning at nine and leaving at about</seg><seg type="columnLine">five in the afternoon.

It became so difficult for us to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other out of our sight that we even</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into the woods together for specimens</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be experimented with in the laboratory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These specimens she could easily have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered for me quite alone.

I could read the suggestive head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines and the salaciously worded account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the manner in which my wife had</seg><seg type="columnLine">trapped me--a university professor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensational newspapers in particular would</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejoice in the opportunity of pilloring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposedly academic scientist and of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posing him as if he were a libertine in cap</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Jeanne who saved us.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped the bundle on the floor and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to grope within it.

My wife entered, and with her a</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid-whom she evidently brought as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness. Her lips were tightly drawn; her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were mere slits. If ever there was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">infuriated woman bent on vengeance, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was she.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked about her.

She darted to the closet in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeanne would hang her hat and coat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I my laboratory aprons, convinced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeanne was hidden there.

So this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all that was left to me of Jeanne. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the price of my weakness and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowardice!

My whole body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bathed in a perspiration of fright.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suppose that I were accused of murder?</seg><seg type="columnLine">A divorce scandal was bad enough, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a murder, a murder--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lecturing was out of the question. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephoned to the university that illness</seg><seg type="columnLine">would prevent me from attending and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the class was to be dismissed. I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think this out; T must gain time. My case</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clearly desperate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All at once a ray of hope flashed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Why not try salt? If parameba, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea-urchin, a goldfish--and a fish is, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, not so very low in the scale of evo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lution--can be restored to their natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportions and to life, why not a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">being? Yes, perhaps the salt solution</seg><seg type="columnLine">would save me and bring back my Jeanne</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what reason had I to suppose that</seg><seg type="columnLine">because a few animals could be reduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">and expanded at will, I might bring Jeanne</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to life? Suppose that the little statu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ette should return to life, but to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mere miniature of Jeanne? That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too horrible!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Worse still, suppose that the figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">should reassume the girl's natural shape,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but that no spark of life would reanimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body? What then? I should be worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">off tljan ever. The white remnant of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I carried with me could be hidden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The clothes in the chest, too, could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposed of. No one could prove that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeanne was really dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a lifeless body--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I fled into the laboratory. If ever a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the verge of madness, it was I.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tormented by grief at the loss of Jeanne</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stricken with terror at the prospect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of arrest, I felt like a wild beast at bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I longed for some simple-minded, prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical, unscientific friend to whom I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn for counsel in my need.

However, my problem was my</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem; I alone could solve it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came to me very clearly at last that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I owed it to Jeanne to make some effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">at resuscitating all that was left of her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The resolution was more easily made than</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried out. Where should I conduct this</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentous experiment?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The laboratory naturally suggested it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self first. I dismissed the thought almect</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. There was no vessel large enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold a human body, and suspicion might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be aroused if I had one brought in. I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to a hotel and enga'ge a room and bath;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bathtub would surely serve the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But suppose that the little figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeanne should swell and magnify, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose that life should not return.

Walk ten min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes away from the village and you might</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well be in the Desert of Sahara for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of human life that you can see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew the coast well; many a specimen</seg><seg type="columnLine">had I collected among the rocks as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tide went out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was dark when I alighted from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train, four miles from Glaston. The full</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon was rising in the east--a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, yellow topaz that crept higher and</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher in the sky. I had not counted on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To carry out a hazardous experiment in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aspect of that cold, luminous disk</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed too public.

Then it occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me how strangely fascinated Jeanne had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always been by the full moon. How she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had longed for the time when we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch it rise together in some such lonely</seg><seg type="columnLine">place as this, shut off from the strife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clamor and the prying eyes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. I am not superstitious, but it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem as if that great ball in the sky might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a good omen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At about ten o'clock I reached the shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">two miles above Glaston; for I had care-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fully avoided the village. It was flood tide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sea was dappled with opalescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripples. Now and then a swelling wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">would roll up on the sands and the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">would tumble reluctantly back again in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast expanse of foam.

I feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I might break off a strand of hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">or nick a foot or hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Holding the figure in my outstretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands as if it were a sacred image, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked into the sea straight toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, my face uplifted.

Surely no worshiper</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had ever entered an ancient Egyptian</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple was more reverentially hopeful</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I, nor more innocently expectant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a miracle that would sweep away all earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly doubts and reveal the hand of destiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself pointing toward the light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">38</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly the water rose to my knees, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my waist, and at last to my breast. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapped the frail figure in my hand. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched the thing lest it should slip from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my grasp. How long I stood thus, shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der-high in the waves, I do not know. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps it was only five minutes, perhaps as</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as a quarter of an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I know that I was stricken with terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time; for the figure in my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been made of stone for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">change that I could feel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was I to fail? Was Jeanne hopelessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">irretrievably dead?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a moment came when the figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to slip in my hands. I grasped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">tighter lest I should lose it. Still it slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">--slipped as a fish slips in the hands. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I realized what was happening. Jeanne was</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing, literally growing in my crooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers! I almost swooned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even if the swelling miniature were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most precious thing in the world to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if it did not mean happiness and life</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, I would have found it difficult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">retain my self-control. Very, very slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the figure grew to the size of a child. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to hold it in my arms now; it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only larger, but perceptibly heavier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A doubt assailed me. Would it stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing? I prayed that it might keep on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently it grew so large that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer hold it in my arms alone. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked back a few steps and lowered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure so that its feet touched the bottom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I saw to it that it was completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">immersed, fearful lest some monstrous ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect might be produced if even a shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dry and could not grow with the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In half an hour, I should judge, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been apparently an exquisite statuette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that I could carry in my pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become the full-sized form of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeanne. But it was still hard. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no feeling of yielding flesh--nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rigidity of so much clay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For that I had been prepared by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">observation that I had made in my labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. Life returned to a shrunken organism</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, almost hesitantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I felt Jeanne soften in my arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She was a thing of flesh now.

Her bosom heaved; she sighed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes opened. She moaned, and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me, utterly bewildered. Her mind could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not orient itself at first. In a dim way</seg><seg type="columnLine">she seemed to realize who I was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could feel her arms tighten about my</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, and so I carried her to the beach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the most ecstatic and exalted state in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I have ever been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1TOLD my wife everything--every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of the initial experiments with</seg><seg type="columnLine">parameba and the goldfish, everything ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept Jeanne's bold swallowing of the baro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turpinol in a critical situation and of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsequent miraculous reanimation.

Ever since her astonishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">restoration we had arranged to see each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other there three times a week. Her re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to the laboratory was out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question for the time being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There she was at the appointed time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and place, looking very demure in a neat</seg><seg type="columnLine">white dress which she had made herself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She saw that I was troubled, and I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her at once the outcome of the afternoon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">parley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Either she would not or she could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the situation in its true light.

She was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than willing to forego ordinary social in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tercourse if she could only work and</seg><seg type="columnLine">live with me. A thousand reasons she</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced to prove how unnecessary the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer world must be to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was a born romanticist, living per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petually in a fairy castle on a mountain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">top capped with silvery clouds. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere there is no time; Jeanne lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in the present. I could hope for no</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical assistance from her. I must rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son this problem out for myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I changed the topic at the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity, and we passed the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening in the usual lighthearted way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During these meetings we talked chiefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the romantic possibilities of barotur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How simple and cheap it would be for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to travel," she would ramble on.

"In all proba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility he once had a day the same length</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ours.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up eagerly as the doctor coughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">apologetically and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't forget that, even if Mercury is</seg><seg type="columnLine">part baked and part frozen, there must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a region in between which is neither." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up a small globe from the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran a finger • completely around it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from pole to pole. "So.

This, in order to act as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brake, and prevent them from falling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, Van Emmon, the geologist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose eyes had been glued to his binocu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars, gave an exclamation of wonder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look at those faults!" He pointed to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward a region south of that for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were bound; what might be called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet's torrid zone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first it was hard to see; then, little</seg><seg type="columnLine">by little, there unfolded before their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">a giant, spiderlike system of chasms in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange surface beneath them. From a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point almost directly opposite the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these cracks radiated in a half-dozen dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent directions; vast, irregular clefts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ran through mountain and plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike. In places they must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of miles wide, while there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no guessing as to their width. For all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four in the cube could see, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottomless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Small likelihood of anybody being</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive there now," commented the geologist</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeptically. "If the sun has dried it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to produce faults like that, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">could animal life exist?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Notice, however," prompted the doctor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that the cracks do not extend all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the edge of the disk." This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">true; all the great chasms ended far</seg><seg type="columnLine">short of the "twilight band" which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor had declared might still contain</seg><seg type="columnLine">life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as the sky-car rushed downward</seg><seg type="columnLine">their attention became fixed upon the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face directly beneath them, a point whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">latitude corresponded roughly with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of New York on the earth. It was a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gion of low-lying mountains, decidedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from various precipitous ranges</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be seen to the north and east. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west, or left-hand side of this district, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively level stretch, with an occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional peak or two projecting, suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ancient bed of an ocean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time they were within a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand miles. Smith threw on a little more</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">current; their speed diminished to a safer</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, and they scanned the approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface with the greatest of care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Do either of you fellows see anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">green?" demanded the engineer, a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">later.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">builder asked what he meant. He ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained: "So far as we know, all animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">life depends upon vegetation for its oxy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gen. Not only the oxygen in the air, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stored in the plants which animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat. Unless there's greenery--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused at a low exclamation from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith. The engineer's eyes were fixed, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder and excitement, upon that part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley which lay at the joint of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"L" below them. It was perhaps six miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">across; and all over the comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth surface jutted dark projections.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Viewed through the glasses, they had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular uniform appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Jove!" exclaimed the doctor, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most in awe. He leaned forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrubbed the deadlight for the tenth time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All four men strained their eyes to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the architect who broke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence which followed. The other three</seg><seg type="columnLine">were content to let the thrill of the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">have its way with them. Such a feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">had little weight with the expert in</seg><seg type="columnLine">archeology.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he declared jubilantly in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">boyish voice, "either I eat my hat or that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a city!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS SWIFTLY as an elevator drops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as safely, the cube shot straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward. Every second the landscape</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowed and shrunk, leaving the remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing details larger, clearer, sharper. Bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">by bit the amazing thing below them re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved itself into a real metropolis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within .five minutes they were less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a mile above it. Smith threw on more</seg><seg type="columnLine">current, so that the descent stopped; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cube hung motionless in space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For another five minutes the four men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">studied the scene in nervous silence. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the others were looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the_same thing--some sign of life. A little</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot of green, or possibly something in</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion--a single whiff of smoke would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been enough to cause a whoop of joy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But nobody shouted. There was nothing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to shout about. Nowhere in all that local-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ity apparently was there the slightest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sign that any save themselves were alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Instead, the most extraordinary city</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man ever laid eyes upon was stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly beneath. It was grouped about</seg><seg type="columnLine">what seemed to be the meeting-point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three great roads, which led to this spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">from as many passes through the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding hills. And the city seemed thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally divided into three segments, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal size and shape, and each with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">own street system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For they undoubtedly were streets. No</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">metropolis on earth ever had its blocks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laid out with such unvarying exactness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This Mercurian city contained none but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perfect equilateral trianglesl and the.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">streets themselves were of absolutely uni-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">form width.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The buildings, however, showed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">such uniformity. On the outskirts the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks seemed to contain nothing save odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaps of dingy, sun-baked mud. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme north, however, lay five blocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">grouped together, whose buildings, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those in the middle of the city, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather tall, square-cut and of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusty, cream-white hue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Down-town" were several structures</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially prominent for their height. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">towered to such an extent, in fact, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their upper windows were easily made</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Apparently they were hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories high!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Here and there on the streets could be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seen small spots, colored a darker buff</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than the rest of that dazzling landscape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But not one of the spots was 'moving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We'll go down further," said the en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gineer tentatively, in a low tone. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was no comment. He gradually reduced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the repelling current, so that the sky-car</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">resumed its descent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LORD OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" 47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They sank down until they were on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">level with the top of one of those extra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary sky-scrapers. The roof seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly flat, except for a large, round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black opening in its center. No one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When opposite the upper rows of win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows, at a distance of perhaps twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, Smith brought the car to a halt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they peered in. There were no panes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the windows opened directly into a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. But nothing was clearly visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the blackness save the outlines of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings in the opposite walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went down further, keeping well</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the middle of the space above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. At every other yard they kept a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp lookout for the inhabitants; but so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as thev could see, their approach was</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely unobserved. '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When within fifty yards of the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, all four . men made a search for</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross-wires below. They saw none; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no poles, even. Neither, to their as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonishment, was there such a thing as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewalk. The street stretched unbroken</seg><seg type="columnLine">by curbing, from wall to wall and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner to corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As the cube settled slowly to the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the adventurers left the deadlight to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the windows. For a moment the view was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscured by a swirl of dust; raised by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurt of the current. Then this cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished, settling to the ground with as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tounding suddenness, as though jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by some invisible hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Directly ahead of them, perhaps a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred yards, lay a yellowish-brown mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unusual octagonal shape. One end con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained a small oval opening, but the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the earth looked in vain for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature to emerge from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor silently set to work with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his apparatus. From an air-tight double-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doored compartment he obtained a sam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple of the ether outside the car; and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aid of previously arranged chemicals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly learned the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no air. Not only was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">no oxygen, the element upon which all</seg><seg type="columnLine">known life depends, but there was no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nitrogen, no carbon dioxid. Not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest trace of water vapor or of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other less known elements which can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in small amounts in our own at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere. Clearly, as the doctor said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever air the astronomers had ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served must exist on the circumference</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet only, and not in this sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasted, north-central spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On the outer walls of the cube, so ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged as to be visible through the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows, were various instruments. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">barometer showed no pressure. The ther-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mometer, a specially devised one which</seg><seg type="columnLine">used gas instead of mercury, showed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature of six hundred degrees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fahrenheit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No air, no water, and a baking heat;</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the geologist remarked, how could life</seg><seg type="columnLine">exist there? But the architect suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">that possibly there was some form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, of which men knew nothing, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could exist under such circumstances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They got out three of the suits. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a good deal like those worn by</seg><seg type="columnLine">divers, except that the outer layer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of non-conducting aluminum cloth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flexible, air-tight and strong. Between it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the inner lining was a layer of cells,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into which the men now pumped several</seg><seg type="columnLine">pints of liquid oxygen. The terrific cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this chemical made the heavy flannel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the inner lining very welcome; while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oxygen itself, as fast as it evaporated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revitalized the air within the big, glass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced helmet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once safely locked within the clumsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">suits. Jackson, Van Emmon, and Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">took their places within the vestibule;</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the doctor, who had volunteered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay behind, watched them open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer door. With a hiss all the air in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vestibule rushed out: and the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestly thanked his stars that the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">door had been built very strongly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men stepped out on to the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first they moved with great care, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertain that their feet were weighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily enough to counteract the reduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitation of the tiny planet.

Then, keeping al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways within ten feet of each other, so as</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to throw any strain on the connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, they strode in a matter-of-fact way</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the nearest doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment or two they stood ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the queer, peaked archway, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimmering suits standing out oddly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding sunlight. Then they advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">boldly into the opening. In a flash they</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished from the doctor's sight, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inklike blackness of the opening again</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at him from that dazzling wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE HOUSE OF DUST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE geologist, strong man that he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by profession an investigator of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unknown--Van Emmon--took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead. He stalked straight ahead into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast space which, without any preliminary</seg><seg type="columnLine">hallway, filled the entire triangular block.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before their eyes were accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow--"Pretty cold," murmured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">architect into the phone transmitter. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fastened to the inside of the helmet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly in front of his mouth, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiver was placed beside his ear. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">three stopped short to adjust each other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical heating apparatus. To do this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did not use their fingers directly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they manipulated ingenious non-magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">pliers attached to the ends of fingerless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulated mittens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before they had finished, the builder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been puzzling over the extraor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary suddenness with which that cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dust had settled received an inspira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He was carrying note-book and</seg><seg type="columnLine">camera. With his pliers he tore out a sheet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the former, and holding book in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and the leaf in the other, he allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to drop at the same instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They reached the ground together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"See?" The architect repeated the ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">periment. "Back home, where there's air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paper would have floated down.

He said gravely:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Remember what I told you--it's air that</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulates the earth from the ether. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's no air here"--he glanced out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pitiless sunlight--"then I hope there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no flaw in our insulation.

Here, however, as outside, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was coated with that fine, cream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored dust. It filled every nook and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cranny; it stirred about their feet with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The geologist led the way down a broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">aisle, on either side of which towered im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense machinery. Smith was for stopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to examine them one by one; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others vetoed the engineer's passion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode on toward the end of the triangle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More than anything else, they looked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the absent population to show itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Van Emmon stopped short.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Is it possible that they're all asleep?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He added that, even though the sun shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily the year aroilnd, the people must</seg><seg type="columnLine">take times for rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Smith stirred the dust with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot and shook his head. "I've seen no</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks. This dust has been lying here for</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks, perhaps months. If the folks are</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, then they must be taking a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munity vacation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of the aisle they reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small, railed-in space, strongly resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling what might be seen in any office on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. In the middle of it stood a low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat-topped desk, for all the world like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of a prosperous real-estate agent, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept that it was about half a foot lower.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no chair. For lack of a visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate in the railing, the explorers stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, being careful not to touch it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing on top of the desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LORD OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">save the usual coat of dust. Below, a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide space had been left for the legs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whoever had used it. And flanking this</seg><seg type="columnLine">space were two pedestals, containing what</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked to be a multitude of exceedingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">small drawers. Smith bent and examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; apparently they had no locks. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhesitatingly reached out, gripped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knob of one, and pulled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noiselessly, instantaneously, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk crumbled to powder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Startled, Smith stumbled backward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocking against the railing. Next instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">it lay on the floor, its fragments scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguishable from what had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the surface. Only a tiny cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust arose, and in half a second this had</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three looked at each other signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cantly. Clearly, the thing that had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened argued a great lapse of time since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the user of that desk officiated in that en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closure. It looked as though Smith's guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">of "weeks, perhaps months," would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be changed to years, perhaps centuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Feel all right?" asked the geologist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson and Smith made affirmative</seg><seg type="columnLine">noises; and again they stepped out, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time walking in the aisle along the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. They could see their sky-car plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ovals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here the machinery could be examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">more closely. They resembled automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">testing scales, said Smith. The kind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">are used in weighing complicated metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">products after finishing and assembling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, they seemed to be connected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one to the other, with a series of end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less belts. These, Smith thought, indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic production. To all appearances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dust-covered apparatus stood just as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been left when operations ceased, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unguessable length of time before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SMITH showed no desire to touch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things now. Seeing this, the geologist</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberately reached out and scraped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust from the nearest machine. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast relief of all three, no damage-was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. The dust fell straight to the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposing a streak of greenish-white metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Van Emmon made another tentative</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush or so at other points, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same result. Clean, untarnished metal lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath all that dust. Clearly it was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">non-conducting alloy. Whatever it was, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had successfully resisted the action of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elements all the while that such presum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably wooden articles as the desk and rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing had been steadily rotting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Emboldened, Smith clambered up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frame of one of the machines. He ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined it closely as to its cams, clutches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gearing, and other details significant</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to his mechanical training. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted their adjustments, scrutinized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveying apparatus, and came back car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rying a cylindrical object which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed from an automatic chuck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is what they were making," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked, trying to conceal his excitement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The others brushed the dust from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, a huge piece of metal which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been too much for their strength on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. Instantly they identified it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a cannon shell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Van Emmon led the way. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a reassuring glance out the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the familiar cube, then passed along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aisle toward the farther corner. As they</seg><seg type="columnLine">neared it they saw that it contained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small enclosure of heavy metal scrollwork,</seg><seg type="columnLine">within which stood a triangular elevator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men examined it as closely as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, noting especially the extremely low</seg><seg type="columnLine">stool which stood upon its platform. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">same unerodable metal seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been used throughout the whole affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they returned to the heap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">powdered wood which had been the desk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith spied a long work-bench under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-by window. There they found a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary vise, in which was clamped a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal. But for the dust, it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been placed there ten minutes before. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bench lay several tools, some familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the engineer and some entirely strange.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A set of screw-drivers of various sizes</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his eye. He picked them up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again experienced the sensation of having</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood turn to dust at his touch. The blades</seg><seg type="columnLine">were whole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still searching, the engineer found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">square metal chest of drawers, each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he promptly opened. The contents</seg><seg type="columnLine">were laden with dust, but he brushed this</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and disclosed a quantity of exceedingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate instruments. They were more like</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentists' tools than machinists', yet plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">were intended for mechanical use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One drawer held what appeared to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll of drawings. Smith did not want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch them; with infinite care he blew</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the dust with the aid of his oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe. After a moment or two the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear, but it offered no encourage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment; it was the blank side of the paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no help for it. Smith grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roll firmly with his pliers--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next second gazed upon dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the bottom drawer lay something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that aroused the curiosity of all three.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were small reels, about two inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">in diameter and a quarter of an inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick, each incased in a tight-fitting box.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They resembled measuring tapes to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent, except that the ribbons were made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of marvelously thin material. Van Emmon</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed that there were a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a roll. Smith estimated it at three hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred. They seemed to be made of a metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to that composing the machines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith pocketed them all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under the bench they discovered a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">small machine, decidedly like a stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticker, except that it had no glass dome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but possessed at one end a curious metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk about a foot in diameter. Apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been undergoing repairs; it was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to guess its purpose. Smith's pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">was instantly aroused; he tucked it under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm, and was impatient to get back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cube, where he might more carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">examine this find with the tips of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was when they were about to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building that they thought to inspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls and ceiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look-at that dust again! How'd it get</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?" Van Emmon paused while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, the thought finally getting to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a queer chill striking at the backs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their necks. "Men--there's only one way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for the dust to settle on a wall! It's got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have air to carry it! It couldn't pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly get there without air!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That dust settled long before life ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared on the earth, even! It's been there</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever since the air disappeared from Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cury! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LIBRARY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T THOUGHT you'd never get back,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">A complained the doctor crossly, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three entered. They had been gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">just half an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next moment he was studying their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces, and at once he demanded the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">important fact. They told him, and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had finished he was half-way into</seg><seg type="columnLine">another suit. He was all eagerness; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow the three were very glad to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the cube again, and firmly insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon moving to another spot before mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing further explorations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within a minute or two the cube was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovering opposite the upper floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building the three had entered. With only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot of space separating the window of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky-car and the dust-covered wall, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men from the earth inspected the interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">at considerable length. They flashed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">search-light all about the place, and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded that it was the receiving room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the raw iron billets were brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">via the elevator, and from there slid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor below. At one end, in exactly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same location as the desk Smith had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed, stood another, with a low and</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkably broad chair beside it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So far as could be seen, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither doors, window-panes, nor shutters</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the structure. "To get all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and air they could," guessed the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor. "Perhaps that's why the buildings are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all triangular; most wall surface in pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion to floor area, that way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few hundred feet higher they began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look for prominent buildings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We ought to learn something there,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor said after a while, pointing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a particularly large, squat, irregularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LORD OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">built affair on the edge of the "business</seg><seg type="columnLine">district." The architect, however, was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor of an exceptionally large, high build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the isolated group previously noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the "suburbs." But because it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer, they maneuvered first in the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection of the doctor's choice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sky-car came to rest in a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaza opposite what appeared to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure's main entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor was impatient to go. Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">was willing enough to stay behind; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already joyously examining the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine he had found. Two minutes later</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kinney, Van Emmon, and Jackson were</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing before the portals of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There they halted, and no wonder. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire face of the building could now be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen to be covered with a mass of carv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings; for the most part they were statues</seg><seg type="columnLine">in bas relief. All were fantastic in the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treme, but whether purposely so or not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no way to tell. Certainly any</seg><seg type="columnLine">such work on the part of an earthly artist</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have branded him either as insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">or as an incomprehensible genius.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Directly above the entrance was a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">which might have been labeled, "The Tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umph of the Brute." An enormously pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erful man, nearly as broad as he was tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood exulting over his victim, a less ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bust figure, prostrate under his feet. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clad in armor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The victor's face was distorted into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage snarl, startlingly hideous by rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son of the prodigious size of his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted as it was directly upon his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders; for he had no neck. His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">set so close together that at first glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">they seemed to be but one. His nose was</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat and ape-like in type, while his mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoid of curves, was revolting in its huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick-lipped lack of proportion. His chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was square and aggressive; his forehead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely enough, extremely high and</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow, rather than low and broad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His victim lay in an attitude that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicated the most agonizing torture ;--his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head was bent completely back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around behind his shoulders. On the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ground lay two battle-axes, huge affairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as heavy as the massively muscled</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who had used them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the eyes of the explorers kept com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back to the fearsome face of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">queror. From the brows down, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply a huge, brutal giant; above his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, he was an intellectual. The combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was absolutely frightful. The beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked capable of anything, of overcom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing any obstacle, mental or physical, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ternal or external, in order to assert his</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently enormous will. He could con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol himself or dominate others easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It can't be that he was drawn from</seg><seg type="columnLine">life," said the doctor, with an effort. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't easy to criticize that figure, life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less though it was. "On a planet like this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such slight gravitation, there is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">need for such huge strength. The typical</seg><seg type="columnLine">M^rcurian should be tall and flimsy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">build, rather than short and compact."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the geologist differed. "We want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember that the earth has no standard</seg><seg type="columnLine">type. Think what a difference there i3</seg><seg type="columnLine">betweei. the mosquito and the elephant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snake and the spider! One would sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose that they had been developed under</seg><seg type="columnLine">totally different planetary conditions, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of all right on the same globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No; I think this monster may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been genuine." And with that the geologist</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to examine the other statuary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without exception, it resembled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">central group; all the figures were neck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, and all much more heavily built than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any people on earth. There were several</seg><seg type="columnLine">female figures; they had the same general</seg><seg type="columnLine">build, and in every case were so placed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enhance the glory of the males. In one</seg><seg type="columnLine">group the woman was offering up food</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drink to a resting worker. In another</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was being carried off, struggling, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arms of a fairly good-looking war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Kinney led the way into the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. As in the other structure, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no door. The space seemed to be but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">story in height, although that had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of a cathedral. The whole of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling, irregularly arched in a curious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed manner, was ornamented with</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque figures. The walls were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">partially formed of squat, semihuman</seg><seg type="columnLine">statues, set upon huge, triangular shafts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the spaces between these outlandish</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilasters there had once been some sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'decorations. A great many photos were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the floor, it was divided in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions by low walls. About five and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half feet in height, these walls separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great room into perhaps a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangular compartments, each about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of an ordinary living-room. Broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings, about five feet square, provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">free access from one compartment to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. The men from the earth, by stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on tiptoes, could see over and beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">this system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wonder if these walls were supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cut off the view?" speculated the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor. "I mean, do you suppose that, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mercurians were such short people as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?" His question had to go unanswered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stepped into the nearest compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and were on the point of pronounc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it bare, when Jackson, with an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamation, excitedly brushed away some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dust and showed that the presum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably solid walls were really chests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawers. Shallow things of that peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, these drawers numbered several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred to the compartment. In the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">building there must have been millions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONCE more the dust was carefully re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, revealing a layer of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious rolls or reels, exactly similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had been found in the tool chest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shell works. A careful examination</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the metallic tape showed nothing what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever to the naked eye, although the doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor fancied that he made out some strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters on the little boxes themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His view was shortly proved. Finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawer after drawer to contain a similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">display, varying from one to a dozen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the diminutive ribbons, Van Emmon</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopted the plan of gently blowing away</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dust from the faces of the drawers be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore opening them. This revealed the fact</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that each of the shallow things was neatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">labeled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jnstantly the three were intent upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh clue. The markings were very faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">and delicate, the slightest touch being</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to destroy them. To the untrained</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye, they resembled ancient Egyptian</seg><seg type="columnLine">hieroglyphics. To the archeologist, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant that a brand-new system of ideo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphs had been found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Jackson straightened up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about with a new interest. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one of the square doorways and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully removed the dust from a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate on the lintel. He need not have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so careful; engraved in the solid metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a single character, plainly in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">language as the other ideographs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The architect smiled triumphantly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inquiring eyes of his friends. "I won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to eat my hat," said. he. "This is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure-enough city, all right, and this is its</seg><seg type="columnLine">library!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smith was still busy on the little ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine when they returned to the cube.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said that one part of it had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, and was busily engaged in filing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit of steel to take its place. As soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was ready, he thought, they could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the apparatus meant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three had brought a large number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the reels. They were confident that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">microscopic search 'of the ribbons would</seg><seg type="columnLine">disclose something to bear out Jackson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory that the great structure was really</seg><seg type="columnLine">a repository for books, or whatever cor</seg><seg type="columnLine">responded with books on Mercury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the main thing," said the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiastically, "is to get over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'twilight band.' I'm beginning to have all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorts of wild hopes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jackson urged that they first visit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big "mansion" on the outskirts of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place; he said he felt sure, somehow, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be worth while. But Van Em</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon backed up the doctor, and I he archi</seg><seg type="columnLine">tect had to be content with an agreement</seg><seg type="columnLine">to return in case their trip was futile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside of a few minutes the cube was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being drawn steadily over Loward the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">or western edge of the planet's sunlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LORD OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">face. As it moved, all except Smith kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">close watch on the ground below. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out town after town, as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate buildings. And on the roads were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be seen a great many of those octagonal</seg><seg type="columnLine">structures, all motionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After several hundred miles of this, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface abruptly sloped toward what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly been the bed of an ocean. No sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of habitation here, however. So, appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently, the water had disappeared after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans had gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This ancient sea ended a short distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the district they were seeking. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little more travel brought them to a point</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the sun cast as much shadow as</seg><seg type="columnLine">light on the surface. It was here they</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended, coming to rest on a sunlit knoll</seg><seg type="columnLine">which overlooked a small, building-filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> According to Kinney's apparatus, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about one-fortieth the amount of air</seg><seg type="columnLine">that exists on the earth. Of water vapor</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a trace; but all their search re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed no human life. Not only that, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no trace of lower animals; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not even a lizard, much less a bird.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And even the most ancient-looking of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sculptures showed no creatures of the air;</seg><seg type="columnLine">only huge, antediluvian monsters were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever depicted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They took a great many photos as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of course. Also, they investigated</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the big, octagonal machines in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets, finding them to be similar to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ''tanks" used in war, on earth, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept that they did not have the caterpil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar tread. Their eight faces were so linked</seg><seg type="columnLine">together that the entire affair could roll,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a jolting, slab-sided, flopping fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion. Inside were curious engines, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sturdy machines designed to throw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannon-shells the visitors had seen. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive was employed, apparently, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrifugal force generated in whirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels. Apparently these cars, or chariots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were universally used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The explorers returned to the cube,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they found that Smith, happening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look out a window, had spied a pond</seg><seg type="columnLine">not far off. The three visited it and found,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on its banks, the first green stuff they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen; a tiny, flowerless salt grass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">very scarce. It bordered a slimy, bluish</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool of absolutely still fluid. Nobody would</seg><seg type="columnLine">call it water. They took a few samples of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and went back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And within a few minutes the doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid a small glass slide into his microscope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and examined the object with much satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction. What he saw was a tiny, gelatin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like globule; among scientists it is known</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the amoeba. It is the simplest form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life--the so-called "single cell." It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the first thing to live on that planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and apparently it was also the last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CLOSED DOOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS THEY neared Jackson's pet "man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion" each man paid close atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the intervening blocks. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most part these were simply shapeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins; heaps of what had once been, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, brick or stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently the locality they were ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching had been set aside as a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclusive residence district for the elite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the country. Possibly it contained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes of the royalty, assuming that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a royalty. At any rate the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spicuous structure Jackson had selected</seg><seg type="columnLine">was certainly the home of the most im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant member of that colony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the three, once more in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmets and suits, stood before the low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad portico which protected the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance to that edifice, the first thing they</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out was an ornamental frieze run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning across the face. In the same bold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">realistic style as the other sculpture, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was depicted a hand-to-hand battle be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween two groups of those half savage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half cultured monstrosities. And in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">background was shown a glowing orb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See that?" exclaimed the doctor. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of that sun, I mean! Compare it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way old Sol looks now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They took a single glance at the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball of fire over their heads; nine times</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the size it always seemed at home, it con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trasted sharply with the rather small</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball shown in the carvings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Understand?" the doctor went on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When that sculpture was made, Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cury was little nearer the sun than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth is now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The builder was hugely impressed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, eagerly: "Then probably the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">became as highly developed as we?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Van Emmon nodded approvingly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor was opposed. "No; I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, Jackson. Mercury never did have as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much air as the earth, and consequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">had much less oxygen. And the struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">for existence," he went on, watching to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see if the geologist approved each point</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he made it, "the struggle for life is, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last analysis, a struggle for oxygen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "So I would say that life was a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">strenuous proposition here, while it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasted. Perhaps they were--" He stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then added: "What I can't understand is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how did it happen that their affairs came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to such an abrupt end? And why don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">we see any--er--indications?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Skeletons?" The architect shuddered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Next second, though, his face lit up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thought. "I remember reading that elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricity will decompose bone in time." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he shuddered again as his foot stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lifeless, impalpable dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As they passed into the great house the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first thing they noted was the floor, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided, dust-covered, and bare, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for what had perhaps been rugs. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape was the inevitable equilateral tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle. And, here, with a certain magnifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent disregard for precedent, the builders</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done away with a ceiling entirely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and instead had sloped the three walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">up till they met in a single point, a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In one corner a section of the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was elevated perhaps three feet above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest, and directly back of this was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad doorway, set in a short wall. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">three advanced at once toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here the electric torch came in very</seg><seg type="columnLine">handy. It disclosed a poorly lighted stair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, very broad, unrailed, and prepos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">terously steep. The steps were each over</seg><seg type="columnLine">three feet high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"''Difference in gravitation," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor, in response to Jackson's question-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing look. "Easy enough for the old-timers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps." They struggled up the flight as</seg><seg type="columnLine">best they could, reaching the top after</seg><seg type="columnLine">over five minutes of climbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps it was the reaction from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">exertion; at all events each felt a distinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss of confidence as, after regaining their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, they began to explore. Neither said</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything about it to the others; but each</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted a queer sense of foreboding, far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more disquieting than either of them had</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt when investigating anything else. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have been due to the fact that, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hurry, they had not stopped to eat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The floor they were on was fairly well</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted with the usual oval windows. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">space was open, except that it contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same kind of dividing walls they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in the library. Here, however, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment contained but one opening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that not uniformly placed. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the three noted with a growing un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easiness, it was necessary to pass through</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one of them in order to reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner farthest from the ladderlike stairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why it should make them Tineasy, neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN they were almost through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">labyrinth, Van Emmon, after stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on tiptoes for the tenth time, in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to locate himself, noted something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had escaped their attention before. "These</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartments used to be covered over,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, for some reason lowering his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. He pointed out niches in the walls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as undoubtedly once held the ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heavy timbers. "What was this place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow? A trap?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Unconsciously they lightened their steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they neared the last compartment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They found, as expected, that it was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other stairway. Van Emmon turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light upon every corner of the place be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore going any further; but except for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">formless heap of rubbish in one comer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was bare as the rest of the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LORD OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again they climbed, this time for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">much shorter distance; but Jackson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly built chap that he was, needed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little help on the steep stairs. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sorry that they had reached the up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">permost floor of the mansion. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat better lighted than the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, and they were relieved to find that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the triangular compartments did not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the significant niches in their walls. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirits rose perceptibly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the corner farthest from the stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the walls rose straight to the ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, completely cutting off a rather large</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangle. The three paid no attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other compartments, but went straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to what they felt sure was the most vital</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot in the place. And their feelings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">justified with a vengeance when they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the usual doorway in this wall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected by something that had. so far,</seg><seg type="columnLine">been entirely missing everywhere else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was barred by a heavy door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several moments the doctor, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">geologist, and the architect stood before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Neither would have liked to admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would just as soon leave that door</seg><seg type="columnLine">unopened. All the former uneasiness came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. It was all the more inexplicable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the brilliant sunlight only a few feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, that each should have felt chilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •'Wonder if it's locked?" remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van Emmon. He pressed against the dust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered barrier, half expecting it to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dust; but evidently it had been made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the time-defying alloy. It stood firm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it seemed nearly airtight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well!" said the doctor suddenly, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the other two started nervously. ' The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door's got to come down; that's all!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">They looked around; there was no furni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, no loose piece of material of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind. Van Emmon straightway backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the door about six feet, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others followed his example.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All together!" grunted the geologist;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the three aluminum-armored mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters charged the door. It shook under tFTe</seg><seg type="columnLine">impact; a shower of dust fell down; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw that they had loosened the thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Once more!" This time a wide crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed all around the edge of the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the third attempt finished the job.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Noiselessly--for there was no air to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound--but with a heavy jar which all</seg><seg type="columnLine">three felt through their feet, the barrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">went flat on the floor beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that same instant a curious, invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave, like a tiny puff of wind, floated out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the darkness and passed by the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">men from the earth. Each noticed it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one mentioned it at the time. Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emmon was already searching the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness with the torch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently it was only an anteroom. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">few feet beyond was another wall, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it stood another door, larger and heavier</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the first. The three did not stop;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they immediately tried their strength on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this one also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a half dozen attempts without</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much as shaking the massive affair--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's no use," panted the geologist, wish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that he could get a handkerchief to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead. "We can't loosen it without</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jackson was for trying again, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor agreed with Van Emmon. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected that they had been away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith long enough, anyhow. The cube was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight from w'here they were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Van Emmon turned the light on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the anteroom, and found, on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf at one end, a neat pile of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">little reels, eleven in all. He pocketed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot. There was nothing else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jackson and Kinney started to go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here," Van Emmon said in a low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained voice. They went to his side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively glanced behind them before</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at what lay in the dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the imprint of an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">human foot!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE first thing that greeted the ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the explorers upon taking off their</seg><seg type="columnLine">suits in the sky-car, was the exultant</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of Smith. He was too excited to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice anything out of the way in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. He was almost dancing in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his bench, where the unknown machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">now reconstructed, stood belted to a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric motor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It r.uns!" he was shouting. "You got</seg><seg type="columnLine">here just in time!" He began to fumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a switch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What of it?" remarked the doctor in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bland tone which he kept for occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions when Smith needed calming. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">will it do if it does run?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineer looked blank. "Why--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he remembered, and picked up one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the reels at random. "There's a clamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">here just the right size to hold one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these," he explained, fitting the ribbon into</seg><seg type="columnLine">place and threading its free end into a loop</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a spool which looked as though made</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it. But his excitement had passed; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">now cautiously set a small anvil between</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and the apparatus. And then, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aid of a long stick, he threw on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment nothing happened, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hum of the motor. Then a strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leafy rustling sounded from the mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ism. Next, without any warning, a high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched voice, nasal and plaintive but</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctly human, spoke from the big metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The words were unintelligible. The lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage was totally unlike anything ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard on the earth. And yet, deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">if somewhat cringingly, the voice pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded with what was apparently a reci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As the thing went on the four men came</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer and watched the operation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine. The ribbon unrolled slowly; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plain that, if the one topic occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole reel, then it must have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of an ordinary book chapter. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the voice continued, certain dramatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualities came out and governed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, utterly incomprehensible though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were.

One felt that he had extracted every</seg><seg type="columnLine">ounce of power in the language, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">it weak and flabby, unfit for further use.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He threw out his sei nces as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">done with them.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that the young man, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly eager to gain the girl, had fouled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a try to force her favor.

I cared not for the gray beard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor what became of the chit.

I cannot say that I admired her at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first glance; she seemed fit only to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at, not to live. I was minded of some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ancient carvings, which show delicate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly built animals that have long since</seg><seg type="columnLine">been killed off; graceful trifles that rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the old man: "Aye, thou art</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave, and wondrous strong, my lad," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, still a bit shaky from his close call.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was pleased with the acknowledgment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was nothing," I told them; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recounted some of my exploits, notably</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in which I routed a raiding party of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men from Klow, six in all, carrying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two alive on my shoulders.

"They are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst trick of all," he told me; and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never forgot.

I laughed again, and shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">her off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will have naught to do with ye," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her, civilly enough.

'Twas easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough; he was green with envy, anyhow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And so it came about that we met about</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid afternoon, with seconds, in a well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequented field in the outskirts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before supper was eaten my entire troop</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that their new captain had tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ball-slinger away without using it, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken twenty bails from their former com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander's weapon, and while thus wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">had charged the man and despatched him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bare hands! Needless to say, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploit quite won their hearts. None but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blind man could have missed the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spect they showed me when, all bandaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sore, I lined them up next morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Afterward I learned that they had all</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken a pledge to "follow Strokor through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gates of Hofe itself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Twas but a week later that, fully re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered and in perfect fettle, I called my</seg><seg type="columnLine">men together one morn as the sun rose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By that time I had given them a sample</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my brains through ordering a rear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangement of their quarters such as made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same much more comfortable. Also, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dealt with one slight infraction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rules in such a drastic fashion that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew I would brook no trifling. All told,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'tis hard to say whether they thought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of me or of Jon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men," said I, as bluntly as 1 knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"the emperor is an old man. And, as ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, he is disposed to be lenient toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men of Klow; whereas, ye and I well</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that the louts are blackguards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now I will tell ye more. It has come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me lately that Klow is plotting to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack us with strange weapons. Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have told the emperor of it; yet he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not act. He says to wait till we are at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stopped and watched their faces. Sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough; the idea made them ache. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these men was spoiling for a fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, tell me; how would ye like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">become the emperor's bodyguard?" I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have to wait long; the light that</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared in their faces told me plainly. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">--how would ye like to have me for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">emperor?"	,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that their tongues were loosed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hindered them not. They yelled for pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy, and pressed about me like a pack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">children. I saw that the time was ripe for</seg><seg type="columnLine">action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up, then!" I roared, and led the way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We met the emperor's guard on the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs; and from that point on we fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">hacked our way through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, no need to describe that fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a time I thought we were gone; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards had a cunningly devised labyrinth</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the second floor, and attacked us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes in a false ceiling, so that we suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily at first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I saw what was amiss, and shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my men to clear away the timbers;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after that it was clear work. I lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty men before the guard was disposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of. The emperor I finished myself; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged right spryly for a time, but at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">I caught him and tossed him to the foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the upper stairs. And there he still lies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fQr none of my men would touch him. nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">would I. We covered him with quick-lime</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we all feasted on the emperor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">store, and soon were feeling like ourselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Men," I said impressively, "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud of ye. Never did an emperor have</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a dangerous gang of bullies!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that they all grinned happily, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">added: "And 'tis a fine staff of generals</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ye'll make!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Need I say more? Those men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have overturned the palace for me had</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said the word. As. it was. they obeyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my next orders in such a spirit that suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess was assured from the first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First, using the dead emperor's name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I caused the various chiefs to be brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">together at once to the court chamber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same time I contrived to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">any word of our action from getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">abroad. So, when the former staff faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the next morning, they learned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were to be executed. I could trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">not one; they were all friends of the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the chiefs out of the way, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own men taking their commands, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole army fell into my hands. True,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were some insurrections here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there; but my men handled them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such speed and harshness that any further</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubbornness turned to admiration. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LORD OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this time the fame of Strokor was spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the empire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thus it came about that, within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week of the night that old Maka first</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the idea into my head, Strokor, son</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Strok, reigned throughout Vlamaland.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And to make it complete, the army cele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brated my accession by taking a pledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Jon:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "To Strokor, the fittest of the fit!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ASSAULT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW, out of a total population of per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps three million, I had about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter-million first-class fighters in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of the world. Klow, by comparison,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had but two-thirds the number; his land</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a rich one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Shortly my spies reported that his armo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ries were devising a new type of weapon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twas a strange verification of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction to my men. I could learn nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, about -t.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile, I caused a vast number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat-boats to be built, all in secret. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them was intended for a single fighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his supplies. And each was so ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged, with side paddle wheels, that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be driven by the motor in the sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dier's chariot, and thus give each his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Discarding all precedent, I packed not</seg><seg type="columnLine">all my forces together, as had been done</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the past, but scattered them up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the coast fronting the land of Klow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At a prearranged time my quarter-million</seg><seg type="columnLine">men set out, a company in each tiny fleet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just as I had planned, we all arrived at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain spot on Klow's coast at practi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally the same hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Twas a brilliant stroke. The enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked not for a fleet of water-ants, ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to step right out of the sea into battle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their fleet was looking for us, true, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in that shape. And we were all safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore before they had ceased to scour the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas for us.	^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I immediately placed my heavy ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines, and just as all former expeditions</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had done, opened the assault at once with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shower of the poison shells. I relied, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be seen, upon the surprise of my at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack to strike terror into the hearts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">louts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But apparently they were prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything, no matter how rapid the attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My bombardment had not proceeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">many moments before, to my dismay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of their own shells began to fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">among us. Soon they were giving as good</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had placed Maka in my cabinet as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as I had reached the throne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The old man stroked his beard gravely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Perchance it had been wrong to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the old landing. They simply began</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelling it as a matter of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ye are right again," I told him; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthwith moved my pieces over into an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other triangle. Previously, of course, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">my charioteers had gone on toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital. However, I took care to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">my machines, one at a time, so that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no let-up in my bombardment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But scarce had we taken up the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">position before the enemy's shells likewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted, and began to strike once more in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our midst. I swore a great oath and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled upon Maka in wrath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can ye explain this thing? My men</seg><seg type="columnLine">have combed the land about us. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are none of the scouts secreted here. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even so, they could not have notified Klow</seg><seg type="columnLine">so soon. Besides, 'tis pitch dark." I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorely mystified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All we could do was to fling our shells</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fast as our machines would work and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodge the enemy's hail as best we could.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus the time passed, and it was near</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn when the first messengers returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  'They have stopped us just outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the city," was the report. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased me that they should haye pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far at first; I climbed at once into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chariot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Now is the time for Strokor to strike!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gave orders for the staff to remain where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was. "I will send ye word when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city is mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before I started my engine I</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up at the sky, to see if the dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">were yet come; and as I gazed I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw something come between me and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">star. I brushed the hair away from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, and looked again. To my boundless</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise I made out, not one, but three</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange objects moving about swiftly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" I cried, and my whole staff</seg><seg type="columnLine">craned their necks. In a moment all had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, and great was' their wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Twas Maka who spoke first. "They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">much too large to be creatures of Jon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he muttered. "They must be some trick</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dost recall Edam's vision of the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures in the air of Jeos?" he went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing that I would not hinder him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now, as I remember it, he said they</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew with great speed. Were it not pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, Strokor, for suitable engines to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pel very light structures at such high</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed as to remain suspended in the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the manner of leaves in a storm?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I note these strangers move quite fast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was even so; and at that same in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant one of them swung directly above</seg><seg type="columnLine">our heads, so close that I could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hum of a powerful engine. So it was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trick! I shook myself together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Attention!" My staff drew up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word. "They are but few; fear them not!</seg><seg type="columnLine">We waste no more time here! Pack up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machines, and follow!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thus we charged upon Klow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found that my men had entirely sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded the city. Klow's men were put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting up a plucky fight, and showing no</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of fearing us. Seeing this, I blew a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast on my engine's whistle, so that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullies might know that I had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately the word ran up and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line, so that within a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">Klow was facing a roaring crowd of half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad terrors. I myself set the example by</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging the nearest group of the enemy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were mounted within the rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">small and perfectly circular chariots</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they preferred. They were quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slippery, but they could not stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">before a determined rush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ran them down, and toppled them</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, and dropped suffocation bombs into</seg><seg type="columnLine">their little cages with such vigor and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard of their volleys that my men could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not resist the example. We charged all</seg><seg type="columnLine">along that vast circular line, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheered mightily when the whole front</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke, turned tail, and ran before us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT scarce had they got away before</seg><seg type="columnLine">a queer thing happened. A flock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those great air-creatures, some eight alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, rose up from the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. It was now fairly light, and we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see well. They came out to the battleline</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began to circle the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they did so they dropped odd, mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapen parcels, totally unlike materials of</seg><seg type="columnLine">war; but when they struck they gave off</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodigious puffs of a greenish smoke, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">so terribly pungent a nature that my men</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped before it like apples from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken tree. 'Twas a fearful sight; lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us that the louts had had no practise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">else few of us should be alive to tell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so they swept around the great cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cle, many triangles in area; and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the unthinkable things smote the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts of my men with a fear they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never known. Only one of the devices suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered; it was brought down by a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling of a poison shell. The rest, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosing their burdens, returned to the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am no fool. I saw that we could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing against such weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Return!" I commanded, and instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">my staff whistled the code. The men</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed with alacrity, making off at top</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed with the men of Klow in hot pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit, although able to do little damage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aye, it was a sorrowful thing, that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat. I was mainly angry that Klow had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not showed himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time I- had reached the sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore, most of my men were in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats. I stayed till the last, although I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the enemy's fleet bearing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard upon us from the north. In truth we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have all been lost, had we come</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LORD OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">- 67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the manner of former campaigns, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in big transports. But because</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could scatter every which way, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet harmed us little; and four-fifths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us got safely back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Happily, none of the air-machines had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">range enough to reach Vlamaland. As soon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as I could get my staff together, I gave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">orders such as would insure discipline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then, reminding my hearties that Klow,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knowing our helplessness, would surely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attack as soon as fully equipped, I made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this offer:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "To the man who shall suggest the best</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">way of meeting their attack, I shall give</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the third of my empire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they knew that the case was des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate. As for myself, I slept not a bit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but paced my sleep-chamber and thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, a bit of a shell, from an enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">slinger, had penetrated my arm. Till now,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I had paid no attention to it. But it began</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to bother me, so I pulled the metal from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my arm with my teeth. And quite by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chance I placed the billet on the table</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">within a few inches of the compass I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">carried on my boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To my intense surprise the needle of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">compass swung violently about, so that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one end pointed directly at the fragment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of metal. I moved them closer together;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there was no doubt that they were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strongly attracted. The enemy's shells</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were made of mere iron!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The moment I fully realized this, I saw</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clearly how we might baffle the men of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Klow. I instantly summoned some men,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gave the orders much as though T had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">known for years what was to be done,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and in a few moments had the satisfaction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of seeing my messengers hurrying north</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And so it came about that, within three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">days of our shameful retreat, a tenth of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my men were at work on the new project.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As yet there was no word from my spies</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">across the sea; but we worked with all pos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sible haste. And this, very briefly, is_what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we did:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We laid a gigantic line of iron clear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">across the empire. From north to south,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from snow to snow; one end was bedded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the island of Pathna, where the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic-pole is found, while the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped on the opposite side of the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hole dug through the ice into the solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth of the South Polar Plain. And every</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of that enormous rod--'twas as big</seg><seg type="columnLine">around as my leg--was insulated from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground with pieces of our secret non-mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netic alloy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not for nothing had our chemists</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought the metal which would resist the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning. And not for nothing did my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullies piece the rod together, all working</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time, so that the whole thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was complete in seven days. That is, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete save for the final connecting link.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that lay, a loglike roll of iron, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of my palace, ready to be rolled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">place whenever I was ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And on the morrow Klow reached our</seg><seg type="columnLine">shores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VICTORY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MY first intent was to let them ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vance unhampered; but Maka</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out that such a policy might give</seg><seg type="columnLine">them suspicions, and so we disputed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">course all the way. I gave orders to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">no great amount of resistance. Thus the</seg><seg type="columnLine">louts reached Vlama in high feather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident that the game was theirs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I stood at the door of the palace as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Klow himself rolled up to the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parade-ground. My men, obeying orders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given way to him; his crew swarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space behind and on all sides,of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while my own bullies were all about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the palace. Never did two such</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant armies face one another in peace;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I had caused my banner to be floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong end to, in token of surrender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  First, a small body of subordinates</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited upon me, demanding that I give</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the throne. I answered that I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat with none save Klow himself. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly the knave, surrounded by perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty underlings, stepped up before me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hail, Strokor!" he growled, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking a bit with excitement; not with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, for he were a brave man. "Hail to</seg><seg type="columnLine">thee and to thine, and a pleasant stay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hofe for ye all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hail, Klow!" replied I, glancing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningly at the air monsters wheeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. "I take it that ye purpose to exe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cute us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye," he growled savagely.

So be it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I strode down to the great log of</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron which lay ready to fill the gap. Klow</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at me with a peculiar expression,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though he thought me mad. True, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked it; how could I do him harm with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out myself suffering?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I kicked the props which held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron, and gave it a start with my foot. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends of the pole-to-pole rod lay concealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by brush, perchance fifty yards away. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten seconds that last section had rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely between them; and only a fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have missed seeing that, the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet, the iron was fair jerked through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As this happened we all heard a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous crackling, like that of near-by</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning, while enormous clouds of dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose from the two concealed ends, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now become connections. And at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time a loud, steely click, just one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no more, sounded from the intruding</seg><seg type="columnLine">host. '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Klow was vastly puzzled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he snarled angrily: "What means</seg><seg type="columnLine">this foolery, Strokor? Advance, and give</seg><seg type="columnLine">us thy ax!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For answer I turned me about, so as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face my men, and held up my hand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal. Instantly the whistles sounded, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hearties came bounding into the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Treachery!" shouted Klow; and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers ran here and there, shouting: "To</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">arms! Charge and destroy! No quarter!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I paid little attention to the hub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubs I was gazing up at those infernal</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures of the air; and my heart sang</seg><seg type="columnLine">within me as I saw them, circling errati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally but very surely down to the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as they came nearer, my satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">was entire; for their engines were silent!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same time consternation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reigning among our visitors. Not a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all Klow's thousands was able to move his</seg><seg type="columnLine">■</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">car or lift a weapon. Every slinger was</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed, as though frozen by invisible ice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All their balls and shells were stuck to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, like the work of a transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">glue. Even their side arms were locked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their scabbards; and all their tugging</seg><seg type="columnLine">could budge them not!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But none of my men were so handi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">capped. Each man's chariot was running</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though nothing had happened. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundered forward, discharging their balls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shells as freely as they had across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea. Their charge was a murderous one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a man of Klow's was able to resist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save with what force he could put into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Klow saw all this from the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his group of officers. None were able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than place his body 'twixt us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their chief. In a very few moments they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that the unknown magic had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as children in our hands. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly lost; and Klow turned away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight with a black face. Again he faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What means this, ye huge bundle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies? What mean ye by tricking us with</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon badge of surrender, only to tie our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands with thy magic of Hofe? Is this the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to fight like a man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had stood at ease in my door since</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling the iron. Now, I looked about me</seg><seg type="columnLine">still more easily; my men were running</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the louts who had jumped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their useless chariots and taken to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels. 'Twas but a matter of time before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army of Klow would be no more, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Klow," I answered him mildly; "ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">are right; this is not the way to fight like</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LORD OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">- 69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a man.

And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon thy own head be the blame for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trick I have played upon ye!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You attacked us without provoca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion," he muttered, sourly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Aye, and for a very good reason," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied. "Yet I see thy view-point, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shalt give thee the benefit of the doubt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned to my whistlers and gave an</seg><seg type="columnLine">order; so that presently the great slaugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter had stopped. My men and Klow's alike</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled back to see what might be amiss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I handed Klow an ax. "Throw away</seg><seg type="columnLine">thine own, scabbard and all," I told him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is useless, for 'tis made of iron.

"What</seg><seg type="columnLine">means it, Strokor?" asked he again, mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while stripping himself in a businesslike</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion that was good to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It means," said I, throwing off my</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe, "that I have unchained the mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netism of this world. Know you, Klow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all of the children of the sun are full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his power. It is like unto that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny magnet which ye give children for</seg><seg type="columnLine">to play. But it is mighty, even as our</seg><seg type="columnLine">world is mighty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. "Good Jon!" he gasped; for his was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a daring mind. "What have ye done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye trifler?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I have transformed this empire into</seg><seg type="columnLine">one vast magnet," I answered coolly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I showed him a boulder on the sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit of a distant hill; through the tube,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Klow could see some of my men standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Place one of thy own men on the roof</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the palace," I told Klow, "and give him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">orders to lower my banner should ye give</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him the word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"For upon the outcome of this fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">twixt me and thee, Klow, hinges the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole affair!

I became angry; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told my bullies to stay where they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself burst in the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The house was a sturdy stone affair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one floor, set against the side of the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, a short distance above the flume. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked about the interior in surprise; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a soul was in sight in any of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partments. There were signs that people</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been there but a few moments before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I called it strange, for I had seen no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the house as I approached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At last, as I was inspecting the eating</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, I noted a small door let into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer wall. It was open; and by squeezing</seg><seg type="columnLine">I managed to get through. I found that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">let into a long, dark passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I followed this, going steadily down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight of stairs, and all of a sudden bumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into an iron grating. At the same moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that the passageway made fT turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">just beyond. By craning my neck and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">straining my eyes I could see a faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted chamber just a few feet away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And before my eyes could scarce make</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the figures of some people in the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of the place, a voice came to my ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hail, Strokor!" it said. And great was</seg><seg type="columnLine">my astonishment as I recognized the tones</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Edam, the young dreamer whom Maka</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought to my house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Edam!" I cried. "What do ye here?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come and open these bars!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made no reply, save to laugh in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way I did not like. I shook the grating</seg><seg type="columnLine">savagely, so that I felt it give. "Edam!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I roared. "Open this grating at once; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me, where is Ave?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "1 am here," came another voice. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped in sheer surprise, to peer closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to see, for the first time, that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">really the dreamer and the chit, these two</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no more, who sat there in the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground chamber. They seemed to be sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting in some sort of a box, with glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ave, come here!" I spoke much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently than to Edam; for my heart was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft with thoughts of her. "It is thy lord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strokor, the emperor, who calls thee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I stay here," said she in the same clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, entirely unshaken by my presence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Edam hath claimed me, and I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleave to him. I want none of ye, ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a moment I was minded to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">my weight against the barrier, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">was my rage. Then I thought better on</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and closely examined the bars. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">were loose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ave," said I, contriving to keep my</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice even, although my hands were busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the bars as I spoke. "Ave--ye do</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong to spite me thus. Know ye not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 am the emperor, and that these bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot stand before me? I warn ye, if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must call my men to help me, and to wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness my shame, it will go hard with ye!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Better that ye should come willingly. Ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not for such as Edam."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No?" quoth the young man, speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">up for the chit. "Ye are wrong, Strokor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We defy thee to do thy worst; we are pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to flee from ye at all costs!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had twisted one of the bars out of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way without their seeing it. I strove at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next as I answered, still controlling</seg><seg type="columnLine">my voice, " 'Twill do ye no good to flee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edam, ye know that. And as for Ave--</seg><seg type="columnLine">she shall wish she had never been born! "</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So I should," she replied with spirit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"if I were to become thy woman. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you, Strokor, that Ave, the daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Durok, would rather die than take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of one who had spurned her, as ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">did me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I had; it had slipped my mind. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want thee now, Ave," said I softly, pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paring to slip through the opening I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. "Surely ye would not take thine</seg><seg type="columnLine">own life?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nay," she answered, with a laugh in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voice. "Rather I would go with Edam</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. I would go," she finished, her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising in her excitement, "away from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible world;,away from it all, Strokor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to Jeos! Hear ye? To Jeos! And--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">But at that instant I burst through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating. Without a sound I charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight for the pair of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And without a sound they slipped away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my grasp. Next second I was gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupidly at the rushing, swirling water</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flume.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I saw that they had been sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cabin of a tiny boat, and that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had got away!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an opening into the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">air; I rushed through, and stared in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing twilight down the black furrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flume. Far in the distance, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">going like a streak, I spied the glittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass windows of the little craft. Once I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out the flutter of a saucy hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall get them when they reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley!" I shouted to the men. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reached for my tube, and sighted it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower end of the flume, far, far below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost too far away to be clear to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an incredibly short time the craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the end. It traveled at an extraor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary rate; perchance 'twas weighted. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">marveled that its windows could stand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of the air. And I scarce had time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fear that the twain should be destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that upturned spillway before it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then an awesome thing happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the boat struck the incline it shot up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward into the air at a steep slant. Up, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">it went. My heart jumped into my mouth;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for surely they must be crushed when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the craft did not come down. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on and on, up and up; its speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely slackened; 'twas like that of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting star. And in far less time than it</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes to tell it, the little boat was high</seg><seg type="columnLine">up among the stars, going higher every</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant, and farther away from me. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly the sweat broke cold on my fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. For dead ahead, directly in line</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their travel, lay the bluish white</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of Jeos.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So great was my rage over the escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dreamer with my woman, at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt no sorrow. Later, after days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of search in and about the basin, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to grieve most terribly over my loss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When I came home to the palace, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wellTnigh ill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In vain did I make the most generous</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rewards. The whole empire turned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to search for the missing ones, but noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing came of it all. Yet I never ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope, especially after my talk with Maka.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye," he said, when I questioned him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it is barely possible that they have left</seg><seg type="columnLine">this world for all time. I have calculated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed which their craft might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">attained, had it the right proportions. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in truth, it might have left the spillway</seg><seg type="columnLine">at such a speed that it entirely overcame</seg><seg type="columnLine">the draw of the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I think it was a slim chance. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is more than likely that Ave shall return."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was I not the fitter man? Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edam's purposes could not succeed; Jon</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have it so. The woman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine, because I had chosen her. And she</seg><seg type="columnLine">must come back to me, and in safety, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should tear Edam into bits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LORD OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as time went on and naught trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pired, I became more and more melan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">choly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Life had become an empty thing; it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been empty enough before I had craved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl, but now it was empty with hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while I got to thinking of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;f the things Maka had told me. The more</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought of the future, the blacker it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eemed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True, there were many other fine women;</seg><seg type="columnLine">'nit there had been only one Ave. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">uch beauty had ever graced this world</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.

I had lost the only woman that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fit for me, and when I died there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be naught left but my name. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the next emperor might blot out, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he chose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had all been in vain!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It shall not be!" I roared to myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">\s I strode about my compartment, gnaw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at my hands in my misery. And in</seg><seg type="columnLine">just such a fit of helpless anger the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea came to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No sooner conceived than put into</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice. I will not go closely into details;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I will relate just the outstanding facts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What I did was to select a very tall moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, located almost on the equator, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">proclaimed my intention to erect a monu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to Jon upon its summit. I caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast quantities of materials to be brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the place; and for a year a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand men labored to put the pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they had finished, they had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mammoth tower, partly of wood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly of alloy. It was made in sections,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that it might be placed, piece upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece, one above another high into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an enormous task. When it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete I had a tower as high as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moantain itself erected upon its summit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And next I caused section after section</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the long, iron, pole-to-pole rod, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tricked Klow, to be hauled up into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the tower. I was only careful to begin the</seg><seg type="columnLine">process from the top and work downward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gave word that the last three sections</seg><seg type="columnLine">be inserted at midday on a given day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And at that hour I was safe inside a</seg><seg type="columnLine">non-magnetic room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I know right well when the deed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. There was a most terrific earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quake. All about me, though I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing at all, I could hear buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling. The din was appalling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same time the air was fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered with the rattle of the lightning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never have I heard the like before. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod had loosed the wrath of the forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">above our air!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as suddenly the whole deafening</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm ended. Perchance the rod was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed by the lightning; I never went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see. For I know, the electricity split</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very ground apart. But I gazed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a window in the top of my palace, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that I had succeeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a soul but myself remained alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> None but buildings made of the alloy</seg><seg type="columnLine">were standing. Not only man, but most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his works had perished in that awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast. I, alone, remained!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I, Strokor, am the survivor 1 I, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest man; it was but fit that I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the last!

The materials they carried would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made considerable of a load had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith removed enough of the weights from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their suits to offset their burden. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the unopened door without spe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial exertion, and with no mishap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They looked in vain for a crack big</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to hold the point of the crowbar;</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither could the most vigorous jabbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosen any of the material. They dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tool and tried the sledge. It gpt no</seg><seg type="columnLine">results; even in the hands of the husky</seg><seg type="columnLine">geologist, the most vigorous blows failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to budge the door. They did not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they propped the powerful hydraulic</seg><seg type="columnLine">jack, a tool sturdy enough to lift a house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an angle against the door. Then, using</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowbar as a lever, the architect</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily turned up the screw, the mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ism multiplying his very ordinary strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundredfold. In a moment it could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen that he was getting results; the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to stir. Van Emmon struck one</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge with the sledge-hammer, and it gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another minute the whole door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighing over a ton, had been pushed al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most out of its opening. The jack, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">balanced, toppled over. They did not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjust it, but threw their combined w'eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the barrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no need to try again. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shiver the huge slab of metal slid, up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, into the space beyond, stood straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">on end for a second or so, then toppled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And this time they heard the crash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For, as the door fell, a great gust of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind rushed out with a hissing shriek,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">almost overbalancing the men from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. They stood still for a while, breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hard from their exertion, trying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain to peer into the blackness before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Under no circumstances would</seg><seg type="columnLine">either of them have admitted that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a minute the architect, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkling with his enthusiasm for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">antique, picked up the electric torch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned it into the compartment. As he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">so the other two stepped to his side, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the three of them faced the unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. It was just as well. Outlined in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that circle of light, and not six feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of them, stood a great chair upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wide platform. And seated in the chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect and alert, his wide open eyes star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing straight into those of the three, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frightful,' mountainous form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strokor, the giant, himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an indeterminable length of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men from the earth stood there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speechless, unbreathing, staring at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful monster as though at a nightmare.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not move; he was entirely at ease,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet plainly on guard, glaring at them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an air of conscious superiority which</seg><seg type="columnLine">held them powerless. Instinctively they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the all-dominating voice in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">records had belonged to this Hercules.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But their instinct could not tell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the man still lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the doctor's brain that worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">first. Automatically, from a lifelong habit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of diagnosis, he inspected that dreadful</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure quite as though it had been that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a patient. Bit by bit his subconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind pieced together the evidence; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the chair showed no signs of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And after a while the doctor's conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind also knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' He is dead," he said positively, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural voice; and such was the vast re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief of the other two that they were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no way startled by the sound. Instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LORD OF DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all three drew long breaths; the tension</seg><seg type="columnLine">was relaxed; and Van Emmon's curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a harsh and unsteady voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How under heaven has he been pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served all this time? Especially," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, remembering, "considering the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we found in the room?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor answered after a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his reply taking the form of advancing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">step or two and holding out a hand.

But such were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the squat proportions of the occupant</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he filled the whole space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slight examination showed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case was not fixed to the platform, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a separate bottom, upon which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumplike chair was set. Also, they found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" 75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that, thanks to the reduced pull of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, it was not hard for the three of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to lift the cabinet bodily, despite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of almost a thousand pounds. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the tools lie there, discarded as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight as they could, and proceeded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry that ages-old superman out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here they could see from an examina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of his mammoth cranium and extraor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary expression, that he was as highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed as the greatest men on earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the back of his head, however, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat that it was only a continuation of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, or, rather, shoulders, that told where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flaw lay.

They had to depend upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general impression they got from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">first-hand investigations; and it is re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable that the doctor should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed so close to the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He must have made up his mind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlast everybody else," was the way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it as he kicked off his suit.

At the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant, with a grinding crash, all three</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of the case collapsed and fell in</seg><seg type="columnLine">splinters to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out!" shrieked Jackson. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring straight into the now unhooded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of the giant. He backed away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled against a stool, and fell to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor in a dead faint. Smith fumbled im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">potently with a hammer. The doctor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking like a leaf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Van Emmon stood still in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks, his eyes fixed on the Goliath; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingernails gashed the palms of his hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he would not budge. And as he stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw, from first to last, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly change that came, after billions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years of waiting, to the sole survivor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mercury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A glaze swept over the huge figure. Next</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant every line in that adamant figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost its strength; the hardness left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and mouth. The head seemed to sink</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower into the massive shoulders, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresistible hands relaxed.

At the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curious acrid odor arose; Smith fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughing. The doctor turned on more</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN LESS than half a minute the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had once conquered a planet was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduced to a steaming mound of brownish</seg><seg type="columnLine">paste. As it sank to the floor of the case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it touched a layer of coarse yellow powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprinkled there; and it was this that</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused the vapor. In a moment the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filled with the haze of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thus it came about that, within</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes from being exposed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of the sky-car, that whole immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk, chair and all, had vanished. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder had turned it to vapor, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purifying chemicals had sucked it up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing was left save a heap of smoking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grayish ashes in the center of the broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Van Emmon's fingers relaxed their grip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stirred to action, turned to Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here!

He, Carey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not insane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Yet, somehow, he was the only one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dimly the doctor's voice drifted again</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the cloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir." He was answering the judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">advocate's question. "I tested Carey's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he went up for full lieutenanT just</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we sailed from the Philippines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They were perfect then. And I examined</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them yesterday again. His eyes are per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fect now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Carey quivered slightly. If it wasn't his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eyes what could it be?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The captain had declared that he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a trustworthy seaman; the medico swore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that he was neither insane nor visually</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">defective. Then what? He had seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And ever since the thing had occurred</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he had been in this daze. He could not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE judge advocate put another ques-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor answered with promptness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and certitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, I have heard of such cases. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are not of uncommon occurrence. I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heard them discussed in many a ward-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">room. Last spring, when the division was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proceeding from Manila to Lingayen Gulf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for torpedo practice there happened an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instance of it. I was on the flagboat, lead-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing the column. It was during the first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">watch. I was on the bridge, and the cap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tain and navigator were there with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">officer of the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We had just rounded Cape Bolinao</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and expected to pick up the light across</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the gulf. We were all peering dead ahead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--there's always a little rivalry to sight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a light first. The division commander or-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dered one-third speed until we got a bear-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing on that light. Then he was going to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turn column right and go down the gulf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and anchor off Dagupan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For half an hour every man on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bridge gazed straight ahead and strained</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to see the light we knew must show up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly one of the men on the lookout</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sang out that he saw it. He pointed almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">due west, about a point on the port bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We all strove to make it out. The lookout</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">insisted it was there. Then one after an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other we saw it. It was an occulting light,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and we could even discern its pulsations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and check its rate. The column swung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">south at standard speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ten minutes later we had to change</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">course several degrees to westward to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">going on the beach. The next day we re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ceived a radio to the effect that that light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had not been in order for two nights. Yet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we had seen it. We had expected it to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there, and our straining eyes had actually</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">envisioned the thing. It's a common</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enough occurrence, as I said before. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eye often sees what we want it to see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The members of the court nodded un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand! ngly. The judge advocate made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pertinent query.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it really the eye that sees this spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of a light that doesn't exist?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would say not," he answered slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"In my estimation it is not the eye that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sees it at all. It's the brain behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye. The brain knows that the light ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be seen and deludes itself into the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief that it actually does see it. No, it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brain in such a case rather than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But in the defendant's case," came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the .logical question, "there was no such</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectation. How do you account for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor shrugged his shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carey moved uneasily in his chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the very question that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled him ever since that night a week</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. He had not expected to see the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that so clearly impressed themselves on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his vision. He had not even been thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about such a thing. The lower reaches of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yangtze had few enough lights; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparse were ships that ran the river at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. His own destroyer had attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">it solely because ordered down from Che-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foo for emergency missionary protection</seg><seg type="columnLine">upstream. For above Hankow was a local</seg><seg type="columnLine">uprising led by a Taoist priesthood. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">river gunboats were five hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther up stream, and turtle slow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyer, though north in Pechili Gulf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reach the threatened area first. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had entered the river's upper channel</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No, he had not expected to see a thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet of the half dozen men on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge he had, and only he. The medico</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just stated that such hallucination</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was of the brain rather than the eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Could it have been his brain--his alone?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The_fog closed in upon Carey again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it hard to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the defendant's case," he felt more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than heard the doctor say, "I find no</seg><seg type="columnLine">precedent. I can simply testify that he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steady man, entirely sane, and has per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect eyesight. And yet I do believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was dead certain that he saw those</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights. And as certain, too, that the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not. What he saw must have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">delusion of the mind, yet of a mind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was normal. Such things also do occur.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet his eyes are perfect, and he is as bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anced mentally as any officer here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carey's hands bit into each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His captain was for him. And now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">medico.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet--and yet? What could the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court do? He had committed a crime for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which in olden days he might have hanged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And his excuse for the offense was what?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simply that he had seen something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other man had seen. The mere fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the catastrophe he saw coming over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed them on the very heels of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain's interference could have but little</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight with a court that must decide his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate on tangible fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet--good Heaven, it must be ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuse enough! He had seen the lights, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain had interfered, disaster had fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed. It would not have closed upon them</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the captain let him alone. Surely the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court must understand that. He had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained it all so carefully, in minutest de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail, when his counsel had put him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand as witness in his own behalf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor was dismissed. The court</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cleared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">C^AREY had the freedom of the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment he felt that the fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze sweeping from the rice paddies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower Whampoo and the Yangtze be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond would clear his head and give a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly stimulation. Then he recalled that</seg><seg type="columnLine">other officers would be topside. Friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">they all were, indeed. But Carey did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">LIGHTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">81</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">desire brotherly companionship just now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor did he care to feel the pitying glances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of old shipmates. He wanted to be alone;</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think; to go over again the events of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past week; of that night. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the passageway to the stateroom as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed him since the disaster. Now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was away from the atmosphere of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court he already felt better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor had said that his eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal. He had also declared that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain was as rational as that of any officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the court--a fine thing and a daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">one for a destroyer medical officer to say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must have meant it, must have wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to strongly impress the court with his ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nestness and his belief. Carey drew a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath of relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Good eyes, good mind. The chill fog</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in fear for the "latter had penetrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">his very being, gradually began to dissi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How clearly it all came back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been officer of the deck. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain had snatched a hasty meal from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the food brought up by his Filipino boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the emergency cabin on the bridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The navigator had plotted changes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, and was below finishing off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee with the other officers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half hour remained of the second dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. Carey had been going over some</seg><seg type="columnLine">points he wished to impress upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief boatswain's mate when he took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight o'clock reports. A tear in the awn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing canvas where it stretched tight over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the freezing apparatus on top of the ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">locker just abaft the bridge was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The awning was beginning to flap, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this night Carey demanded silence on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge. He could sense better, then, any</seg><seg type="columnLine">variation in the hum of the forced draft</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowers. And in the currents of the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yangtze all things must be anticipated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The officer of the deck must know as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the fire-room watch that something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going wrong. Must have the fo'c's'le gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to let go the anchor even before</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of the lost steam came through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice tube.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood on the starboard side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge, near the rack of tubes, leaning on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sill of the open port. Fleet sparks from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain's pipe indicated his almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">identical position near the engine room</seg><seg type="columnLine">telegraphs to port. Carey was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to call the boatswain's mate at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once to have that awning repaired. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had all but turned to give the order when</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye caught something yet dim in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a minute or more he gazed steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the object. Then, from where they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging on one of the searchlight direct-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wheels on the bulkhead of the emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gency cabin, he took up his binoculars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Faintly through the glass he could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that there were three lights instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He softly called the starboard lookout.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you see any lights about three points</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bow?" he asked. "Pretty far off?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lookout stared into the blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night, blinking as the damp breeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedewed his eyelashes. Then he shook his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. "No, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Try the glass," Carey suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lad shook his head as before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't see a thing, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certain of it?" demanded Carey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Absolutely, sir," was the answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CAREY remembered all this with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treme clearness--every detail. Lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bunk in his stateroom, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself living over again that fifteen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute period in which so much had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had taken the binoculars from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookout, and ordered him back to his post.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he glanced at the clock on the emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gency cabin bulkhead just behind the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wheel. This was a matter of habit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing to record. He had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to see any lights, anyway. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flapping of the canvas over the ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">locker did not disconcert him now. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become part of the normal respiration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship, and Carey decided that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not disturb the boatswain's mate about it</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the eight o'clock reports.</seg><seg type="columnLine">82</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned back to his open port, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered the captain staring out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness, charging his pipe with one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the patent fillers he had bought from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greek in Chefoo. He paused tentatively at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his elbow, undecided whether to stay there</seg><seg type="columnLine">or assume the captain's former position</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the annunciators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then something urged him to remain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The captain acknowledged his presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a grunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you see something?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carey nodded rather hesitantly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thought I did, sir. Looked to me like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ship's light off to starboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain lifted his binoculars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">focused them in the direction Carey had</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated. The latter raised his own glass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He recalled that he gave an exclamation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The lights are there, sir, all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seem nearer now, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Humph! I don't make anything out,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carey stepped back of him and leveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arm over his shoulder with the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hand up, as in aiming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About two points on the bow, sir. Left</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifle, captain. There--that's it. See</seg><seg type="columnLine">them now, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Intently the captain gazed, slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing focus with his forefinger on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjusting wheel. Then he dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't see a thing, Carey."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bent to gain the protection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulkhead, and a match scratched, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed over his pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's funny," Carey answered, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what mystified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wondered if perhaps his last look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the light-flooded chart had left dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleams on the retina of his eye. He care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully wiped his eyes with his handkerchief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cleaned the binoculars with a bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lens paper. Then raised them again--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the lights are close now, captain."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lowered his glass slightly.

"A ship as clear as</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. Heading from starboard across our</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. I can see her masthead and port</seg><seg type="columnLine">running light.

To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartermaster: "Get that time." He swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the open port, and snapped for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lookouts. Sensing something unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the very atmosphere, the whole bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">force was now tensely on the alert. "Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you lads see anything ahead--lights?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All hands intently stared out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness of the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their opinion was unanimous.

And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">this wildcat jumped me--" He paused and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes widened. "Which way did he go?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked swiftly. I pointed down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly glowing passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's only one way," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch that bird close," hissed O'Keefe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing to Von Hetzdorp--and pistol in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand stretched his long legs and raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. I looked down at the German. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were open and he reached out a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. I lifted him to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have heard," he said. "We follow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick.

Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hetzdorp was gasping, and his weight pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sed upon me heavily, but he moved with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the will and strength that was in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS WE ran I took hasty note of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel. I saw' that its sides were</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth and polished, and that the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to come not from their surfaces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but from far within them--giving to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls an illusive aspect of distance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth; rendering them spacious in a pecul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iarly weird way. The passage turned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted, ran down, turned again. It came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me that the light that illumined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel was given out by tiny points deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the stone, sprang from the points</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripplingly and spread upon their polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces. Involuntarily I stopped to look more</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurry," gasped Von Hetzdorp. "Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain that later--etheric vibration--set up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fRat composition--stones really etheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights--stupendous! Hurry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through his panting speech broke a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry from far ahead.

Now we were coming fast to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the passage. Before us was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high arch, and through it I glimpsed a dim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting luminosity as of mist filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbows. We reached the portal and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew myself up short, almost tripping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German. For what I was looking into was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chamber that might have been trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported from that enchanted palace of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jinn King that rises beyond the magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains of Kaf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was filled with a shimmering, pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic lambency that thickened in the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tances to impenetrable veils of fairy opales-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cence. It was a shrine of sorcery!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before me stood O'Keefe, and a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in front of him, Huldricksson, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">something clasped tightly in his arms. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norseman's feet were at the verge of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining, silvery lip of stone within whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">oval lay a blue pool. And down upon this</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool staring upward like a gigantic eye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell seven pillars of fantom light--one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them amethyst, one- of rose, another of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, a fourth of blue, and three of</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerald, of silver and of amber. They fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">each upon the azure surface, and I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these were the seven streams of radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, within which the Dweller took shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">--now but pale ghosts of their brilliancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the full energy of the moon stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced through them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Huldricksson bent and placed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shining silver lip of the Pool that w'hich</seg><seg type="columnLine">he held, and I saw that it was the body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a child! He set it there so gently, bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the side and thrust a hand down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. And as he did so he stiffened</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely, moaned and lurched against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little body that lay before him. Instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the form moved, and slipped over the verge</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the blue. Rigid with horror, I w atched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huldricksson recover himself and throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his body over the stone, hands clutching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms thrust deep down. And then I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his lips a long-drawn, heart-shriveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry of pain and of anguish that held in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing human!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Close on its wake came a cry from Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hetzdorp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gotti" shrieked the German. "Drag</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back! Quick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped forward, but before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">half clear the distance, O'Keefe had leaped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, had caught the Norseman by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and toppled him backward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he lay whimpering and sobbing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as I rushed behind the German I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry lean over the lip of the Pool and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover his eyes with a shaking hand; saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Von Hetzdorp peer down into it with real</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity in his cold eyes; heard him murmur,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Das armes Kind! Ach! das armes Kleine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madchen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN I stared down, myself, into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moon Pool, and there, sinking, sink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, was a little maid whose dead face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed, terror-filled eyes looked straight into</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine; and ever sinking slowly, slowly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished! And I knew that this was Olaf's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freda, his beloved "yndling" whose mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">had snatched her up from the Brunhilda's</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck when the Dweller had wrapped its</seg><seg type="columnLine">awesome, coruscating folds about her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had drawn her, the child still in her arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the moonbeam path to where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But where was the mother, and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">had Olaf found his babe?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Simultaneously, it seemed, we straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened ourselves, the three of us, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into each other's faces; each of us, yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even Von Hetzdorp, shaken to the heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The German was first to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have nitroglycerin there, yes?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, pointing toward my medical kit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had gripped unconsciously and carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me during the mad rush down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage. I nodded and drew it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hypodermic," he ordered next, curtly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the syringe, filled it accurately-with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its one one-hundredth of a grain dosage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaned over Huldricksson, who, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> arms held out rigidly, was fighting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath as though a great weight lay on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest. He rolled up the sailor's sleeves half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the shoulder. The arms were white</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that same strange semitranslucence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that 1 had seen on Throckmartin's breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a tendril of the Dweller had touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. His hands were of the same whiteness</seg><seg type="columnLine">--like a baroque pearl. Above the line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, standing out like marble on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronzed arms, Von Hetzdorp thrust the</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He will need all his heart can do," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he reached down into a belt about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his waist and drew from it a small, flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">flask of what seemed to be lead. He opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and let a few drops of its contents fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">on each arm of the Norwegian. The liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkled and instantly began to spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the skin much as oil or gasoline drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped on water does, only far more rapidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as it spread it seemed to draw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkling film over the tainted flesh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">little wisps of vapor rose from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Norseman's mighty chest heaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">with agony, and I could see the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stimulated heart beating in a great pulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his throat. He strove to rise to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his weakness was too great. His hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched. The German gave a grunt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction at this, dropped a little more</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the liquid, and then, watching closely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted again and leaned back. Huld-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ricksson's labored breathing ceased, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head dropped upon Larry's knee, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms and hands the whiteness swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Von Hetzdorp arose and contemplated</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, almost benevolently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He will all right be in five minutes,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "I khow. I do it to pay for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot of mine, and also because we will need</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Yes." He turned to Larry. "You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a poonch like a mule kick, my young</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend," he said. "Some time you pay me</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that shot, eh?" He smiled; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of the grimace was not exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassuring.

I picked her up and I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mine Freda was dead. But I hoped--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I thought maybe mine Helma was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere here, too.

And mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freda she fell." He covered his eyes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping his head on O'Keefe's shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, racked by sobs that seemed to tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his very soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FLAME-TIPPED SHADOWS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VON HETZDORP nodded his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly as Olaf finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jat" he said.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was undoubtedly a man of resource and</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage, and, as he said, possessed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">special information regarding the phenom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">- 89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ena I had come to seek.

Larry echoed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my thoughts:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In effect, Goodwin, the professor's prop-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">osition is this," he said: "He wants to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know what it is that's going on here, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he knows he can't do it by himself. Also he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knows we have the drop on him. We're</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">three to his one, and we have all his hard-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ware and cutlery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was almost a twinkle in Von Hetz-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dorp's eyes. As Larry ended he bowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is not just as I would have put it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perhaps," he said, "but in its skeleton he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was right. Nor will I turn my hand against</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you while we are still in danger here. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pledge you my honor on this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I glanced at Larry half doubtfully and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back at the German.- Then I thrust out a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hand to him. He gripped it, dropped it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and thrust his to Larry. The Irishman hesi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tated then with a laugh, took it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But I'll just keep the guns, professor,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he said. Von Hetzdorp bowed again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Now," he said, "to prove my good faith</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1 will tell you what I know. Something I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knew of what was occurring here before I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was sent"--he corrected himself hurriedly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--"before I came. I found the secret of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">door mechanism even as you did, Dr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Goodwin. But by carelessness, my conden-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sers were broken. I was forced to wait while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I sent for others, and the waiting might be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for months. I took certain precautions, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the first night of this full moon I hid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">myself within the vault of Chau-ta-leur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There is"--he hesitated--"there is a some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing there also which I do not quite un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">derstand that--protects. But I did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know this when I first hid myself, neinf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">All I thought was that I could see from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there and perhaps come through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN INVOLUNTARY thrill of respect</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the man went through me at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifest heroism of this leap of his in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark.

I waited long hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At last, when the moon was low, I saw it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">return--ecstatically--with a man, a native,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in embrace enfolded. It passed through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">door, and soon then the moon became low</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the door closed. I had found it difficult,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and had it not been for whatever it is of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">protection there in the vault--" He hesi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tated again, perplexedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The next night," he went on, "more</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence was mine, yes. And after that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which comes had gone, I looked through</seg><seg type="columnLine">its open door. I said, 'It will not return</seg><seg type="columnLine">for three hours. While it is away, why shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">I not into its home go through the door it</seg><seg type="columnLine">has left open?' So I went--even to here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked at the pillars of light and I tested</seg><seg type="columnLine">the liquid of the Pool on which they fell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what I found led me to believe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape of light emerged from there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I started. Evidently then, he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know just how the Dweller materialized</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Pool. He saw my movement and</seg><seg type="columnLine">interpreted it correctly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know how it comes?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes," I answered. "Later, I will tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I analyzed that liquid," he went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and then I knew I had been right in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">phase at least of my theory. That liquid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Goodwin, is not water, and it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">any fluid known on earth." He handed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small vial, its neck held in a long thong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Take this," he said, "and see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Wonderingly, I took the bottle; dipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down into the Pool. The liquid was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traordinarily light; seemed, in fact, to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vial buoyancy. I held it to the light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was striated, streaked, as though little</seg><seg type="columnLine">living, pulsing veins ran through it. And its</seg><seg type="columnLine">blueness even in the vial, held an intensity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of luminousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Radioactive," said Von Hetzdorp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Some liquid that is intensely radioactive;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what it is I know not at all. Upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living skin it acts like radium raised to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nth power and with an element most</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious added. The solution with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I treated him," he pointed to Huldricks-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, "I had prepared before I came here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from information I had of what I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">find. It is largely salts of radium, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">base is Loeb's formula for the neutraliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of radium and X-ray burns. Taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man at once, before the degeneration</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become really active, I could negative</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. But after two hours I could have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing." He paused a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Next I studied the nature of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous walls. I concluded that whoever</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made them, knew the secret of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almighty's manufacture of light from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ether itself. Colossal! Ja! But the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance of these blocks confines an atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">--how would you say?--atomic manipula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, a conscious arrangement of electrons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-emitting, and perhaps indefinitely so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These blocks are lamps in which oil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick are--electrons drawing light waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">from ether itself! A Prometheus, indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this discoverer! Hein! Hardly had I con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded these investigations before my</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch warned me to go. I went. That which</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes forth returned, this time empty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the next night I did the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Engrossed in research, I let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments go by to the danger point, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely was I replaced within the vault</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the shining thing raced over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, and in its grip the woman and child.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then you came, and that is all. And now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is it you know?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very briefly I went over my story. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes gleamed now and then, but he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupt me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A great secret! A colossal secret!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said at last. "We cannot leave it hidden."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The first thing to do is to try the door,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Larry, matter of fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no use, my young friend,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Von Hetzdorp mildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nevertheless we'll try," said Larry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We retraced our way through the wind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tunnel to the end, but soon even</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe saw that any idea of moving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slab from within was hopeless. We re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the Chamber of the Pool. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillars of light were fainter, and we knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the moon was sinking. On the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside before long dawn would be break-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I began to feel thirst, and the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblance of water within the silvery room</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to glint mockingly as my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ja!" said Von Hetzdorp, reading my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thoughts uncannily. "Ja! We will be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thirsty. And it will be very bad for him of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us who loses control and drinks of that,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my friend!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Larry threw back his shoulders as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">though shaking a burden from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We're four able-bodied men up against</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a bunch of moonshine and a lot of dead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ones.

"I suggest that we look</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around this place and find something that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will take us somewhere. You can bet the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">people that built it had more ways of get-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. ting in than that once-a-month family en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trance.

And how much did Von Hetz-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dorp really know? t wondered, as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Norseman and I started off. Clearly more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than he had told us; and from whence had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come the information that had been de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tailed enough to enable him to prepare an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">antidote for the exact effects the touch of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Moon Pool produced? So, wondering,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I walked with Olaf, and then soon forgot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my perplexity in the contemplation of that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">greater wonder which I was observing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE chamber widened out from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">portal in what' seemed to be the arc</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of an immense circle. The shining walls</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">held a perceptible curve, and from this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">curvature I estimated that the roof was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fully three hundred feet above us. It oc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">curred to me that perhaps the Chamber</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Pool was shaped like half a hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sphere, an inverted bowl. As we silently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passed on, I was confirmed in this belief,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for clearly we were circling. If I were right,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the circumference of the place, reckoning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the radius at three hundred feet, must be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one thousand eight hundred feet, or a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">little less than a third of a mile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The floor was of smooth, mosaic-fitted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blocks of a faintly yellow tinge. They were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not light-emitting like the blocks that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">formed the walls. The radiance from these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">latter, I noted, had the peculiar quality of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thickening a few yards from its source, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was this that produced the effect of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">misty, veiled distances. As we walked, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seven columns of rays streaming down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the crystalline globes high above us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waned steadily ; the glow within the cham-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ber lost its prismatic shimmer and became</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an even gray tone somewhat like moon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light in a thin cloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now before us, out from the wall, jutted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a low terrace. It was all of a pearly rose-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">colored stone, and above it, like a balus-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trade, marched a row of slender, graceful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pillars of the same hue. The face of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terrace was about ten feet high, and all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over it ran a bas-relief of what looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">- like short trailing vines, surmounted by five</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stalks, on the tip of each of which was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flower. Behind the vines ran a design of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">semiglobes from which branched delicate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tendrils. I did not recognize the carved</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flowers; they were, I thought, some sym-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bolization in which the true form of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">original had been lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  How then could I have known the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">L-redible thing which these stones pictured!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We passed along the terrace. It turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in an abrupt curve. I heard a hail, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there, fifty feet away, at the curving end</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of a wall identical with that where we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stood, were Larry and Von Hetzdorp. Ob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">viously the left side of the chamber was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a duplicate of that we had explored. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">joined. In front of us the columned bar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">riers ran back a hundred feet, forming an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alcove. The end of this alcove was another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wall of the same rose stone, but u^on it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the design was much heavier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We took a step forward, and then stop-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ped, every muscle rigid. There was a gasp</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of terrified awe from the Norseman, a gut-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tural exclamation from Von Hetzdorp. For</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on, or rather within, the wall before us, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">great oval began to glow, waxed almost to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a flame, and then shone steadily out as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">though from behind it a light was stream-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing through the stone itself!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Within the roseate oval two flame-tipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows appeared, stood for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then seemed to float out upon its sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. The shadows wavered; the tips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame that nimbused them with flickering</seg><seg type="columnLine">points of violet and vermilion pulsed out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, drew back, darted forth again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more withdrew themselves. And as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did so the shadows thickened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly there before us stood two figures!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One was a girl--a girl whose great eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were golden as the fabled lilies of Kwan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yung that were born of the kiss of the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the amber goddess the demons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lao-tse carved for him; whose softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved lips were red as the royal coral,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whose golden-brown hair reached to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second was a gigantic frog--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman frog, head helmeted with carapace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shell around which a fillet of brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow jewels shone; enormous round eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blue circled with a broad iris of green;</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous body of banded orange and</seg><seg type="columnLine">white girdled with strand upon strand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flashing yellow gems; six feet high if</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inch, and with one webbed paw of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, powerfully muscled forelegs resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the white shoulder of the golden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"i'd follow her through hell!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MOMENTS must have passed as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in stark amazement, gazing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that incredible apparition. The two figures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although as real as any of those who stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me, unfatomlike as it is possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, had a distinct suggestion of--projec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They were there before us--golden-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">92</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">girl and grotesque frog-woman--complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every line and curve. And still it was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though their bodies passed back through</seg><seg type="columnLine">distances. As though, to try to express</seg><seg type="columnLine">the well-nigh inexpressible, the two shapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were looking upon were the end of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinite number stretching in fine linked</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain far away, of which the eyes saw only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest, while in the brain some faculty</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher than sight recognized and registered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unseen others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It crossed my mind that so we three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensional beings might appear to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwellers in the hypothetical two-dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional space we use to help us conceive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth dimension. And yet there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of any metaphysical fourth di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mension about them; they were actualities</seg><seg type="columnLine">--real, breathing, complete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gigantic eyes' of the frog-woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">took us all in, unwinkingly. I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">little glints of phosphorescence shine out</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the metallic green of the outer iris</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. She stood upright, her great legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed, the monstrous slit of a mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly open, revealing a row of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth sharp and pointed as lancets; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paw resting on the girl's shoulder, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering its silken surface, and from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">five webbed digits long yellow claws of</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished horn glistening against the deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate texture of the flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if the frog-woman regarded us all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so did the maiden of the rosy wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes were fastened upon Larry, drink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him in with extraordinary intentness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was tall, far over the average of</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, almost as tall, indeed, as O'Keefe</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself; not more than twenty years old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if that, I thought. Abruptly she leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, the golden eyes softened and grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">tender; the red lips moved as though she</seg><seg type="columnLine">were speaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Larry took a quick step, and his face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of one who after countless births</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes at last upon the twin soul lost to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for ages. The frog woman turned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes upon the girl; her huge lips moved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I knew that she was talking! The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">held out a warning hand to O'Keefe, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then raised it, resting each finger upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the five flowers of the carved vine</seg><seg type="columnLine">close beside her. Once, twice, three times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she-pressed upon the flower centers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I noted that her hand was curiously long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slender, the digits like those wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful tapering ones the painters we call the</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitives gave to their Virgins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three times she pressed the flowers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then looked intently at Larry once more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A slow, sweet smile curved the crimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. She stretched both hands out toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him again eagerly; and then I distinctly</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a burning blush rise swiftly over</seg><seg type="columnLine">white breasts and flowerlike face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in that instant, like the clicking</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of a cinematograph, the pulsing oval</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded and golden-eyed girl and frog-woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thus it was that Lakla, the hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maiden of the Silent Ones, and Larry</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe first looked into each other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With their evanishment a spell was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted from us. Olaf Huldricksson ran a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand over a brow from which tiny beads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sweat had sprung; Von Hetzdorp turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me with an exclamation; Larry stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapt, gazing at the stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eiiidh," I heard him whisper; "Eilidh</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lips like the red, red rowan and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden-brown hair!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clearly of the Ranadae," said Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hetzdorp, " a development of the fossil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Labyrinthodonts: you saw her teeth, ja?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ranadae, yes," I answered.

Now how could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Couldn't, eh?" he said. "But she was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Didn't you notice the sweet little tilted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nose of her, an' the hair an' the eyes like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the sunshine? She's a daughter of the old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">people, the Taithada-Dainn. I'm thinkin'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that's who it was, anyway, that made this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">place on their way to Erin. Not Irish? A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl like that couldn't be anything else!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He strode swiftly over to the wall. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">followed. He sounded the stone. It did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ring hollowly--nor indeed had I expected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it to, for the figures had shadowed them-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">selves through the te'rrace, and had stood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon its surface. Larry paused, stretched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his hand up to the flowers on which the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tapering fingers of the golden-eyed girl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had rested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It was here she put up her hand," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured. He pressed caressingly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carved calyxes, once, twice, a third time</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as she had--and silently and softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall began to split. On each side a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great.stone pivoted slowly, and before us</seg><seg type="columnLine">a portal stood, opening into a narrow cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor glowing with the same rosy lustre</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had gleamed around the flame-tipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  O'Keefe leaped forward. I caught him</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the arm. The far wall of the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been revealed was not more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight feet from where we were, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran, apparently, at right angles to the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance. There was little of it to be seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, save the space just in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and I will confess that my nerves were</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly shaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What's the matter?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wait," I answered. "Don't rush in</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Let us go together and carefully."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come, then, quickly," he said, curiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">distrait. "I won't wait. I must follow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's what she meant, you know»^</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What she meant?" I echoed stupidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">•What she meant when she pointed out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the way to open the wall, of course," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said impatiently.

"That was no Trold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kvirtde, no black witch, that Jomjru! She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a white virgin, ja.

With Huldricksson at one end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe at the other, both of them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatics in hand, and Von Hetzdorp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I between them, we stepped over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threshold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT OUR right, a few feet away, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage ended abruptly in a square</seg><seg type="columnLine">of polished stone, from which came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint rose radiance of what Von Hetzdorp</seg><seg type="columnLine">had called the "etheric lights." The roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the place was less than two feet over</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe's head. Behind us was the portal</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading into the Chamber of the Pool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We turned to the left to look down the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tunnel's length, and each of us stiffened. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yard in front of us lifted a four-foot high,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gently curved barricade, stretching from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wall to wall. Beyond it was blackness; an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">utter and appalling blackness that seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to gather itself from infinite depths and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to be thrust back by the low barrier as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a dike thrusts back the menacing sea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">threatening ever to overwhelm it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rose-glow in which we stood was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut off by that blackness as though it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance; it shimmered out to meet it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was checked as though by a blow. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, so strong was the suggestion of sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ister, straining force within the rayless</seg><seg type="columnLine">opacity that I shrank back, and Von Hetz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dorp with me.

The little electric circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivered down as though afraid, and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest upon a surface that resembled noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing so much as clear, black ice. I ran the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light across, here and there. The floor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corridor was of stone, so smooth, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished, that no man could have walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it; it sloped downward at a slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing angle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'd have to have non-skid chains and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brakes on our feet to tackle that," mused</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry.

Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly they hesitated and then gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's a queer one!" he exclaimed. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">right palm was resting upon a rounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">protuberance, on the side of which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">three small circular indentations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pressed his fingers upon the circles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They gave under the pressure much, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, as an automatic punch does.</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe's thrusting fingers sank deep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper, within the stone. There was a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">click: the slabs that had opened to let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">through swung swiftly together; a curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eusly rapid vibration thrilled through us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wind arose and passed over our heads. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind that grew and grew until it became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whistling shriek, then a roar and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty humming, to which every atom in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our bodies pulsed in rhythm painful almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to disintegration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rosy wall dwindled in a flash to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of light, and disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wrapped in the clinging, impenetrable</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness we were racing, dropping, hurl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at a frightful speed--where?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And ever that awful humming of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing wind and the lightning cleaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tangible dark--so, it came to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">oddly, must the newly released soul race</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the sheer blackness of outer space</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to that Throne of Justice, where God</seg><seg type="columnLine">sits high above all suns!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt Von Hetzdorp creep close to me;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped my nerve and flashed my pocket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light; saw Larry standing, peering, peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, and Huldricksson, one strong arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his shoulders, bracing him. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the speed began to slacken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Millions of miles, it seemed, below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of the unearthly hurricane I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry's voice, thin and ghostlike, beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">its clamor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got it!" shrilled the voice.

I glanced at the illuminated dial of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watch on my wrist. It had been exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve minutes since we had seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roseate door fade into the blackness. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">how far had we gone in those twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes--scores of miles or hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles?--there was no knowing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Far ahead a point of light showed; grew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">steadily; we were within it. Then softly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all movement ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was then I noted that the car, for so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1 must call it, that had brought us to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this place was shaped somewhat like one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Thames punts. Its back must have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fitted with the utmost nicety into th^end</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the passage upon which the inner doors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Moon Pool Chamber had opened,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for certainly when we stepped within it</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been no sign that it was other</seg><seg type="columnLine">than part of the wall itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where was its guiding mechanism? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only conjecture that as the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved away from the entrance there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">slabs that slipped ingeniously into place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">protecting- those within from what would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been instant annihilating contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel walls when the car ran close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, or from pitching out when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirted in the blackness, abysses such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that luminous green space that had sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of our souls shivering back in awe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The car rested in a slit in the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smooth walled chamber perhaps twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet square. The wall facing us was pierced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a low doorway through which we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a flight of steps leading downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced upward. The light streamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through an enormous oval opening, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of which was twice a tall man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">height from the floor. A curving flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, low steps led up to it. And now it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to my steadying brain that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something puzzling, peculiar, strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfamiliar about this light. It was silvery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaded faintly with a delicate blue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed lightly with a nacreous rose; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rose that differed from that of the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">races of the Pool Chamber as the rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the opal differs from that within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pearl. In it were tiny, gleaming points</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the motes in a sunbeam, but sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">white like the dust of diamonds, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quality of vibrant vitality; they were as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they were alive. The light cast no</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little breeze came through the oval</seg><seg type="columnLine">and played about us. It was laden with</seg><seg type="columnLine">what seemed the mingled breath of spice</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers and pines. It was curiously vivify-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and in it the diamonded atoms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light shook and danced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something flashed within the opening--</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluttered and came to rest. A bird stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there regarding us; a bird as large as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pheasant, whose golden eyes were the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the eyes of the maid of the rosy wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whose body was a floating, shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud of moonlight plumes as fairylike as</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">those that veil the gigantic silver moths</seg><seg type="columnLine">which guard, the fellahs say, the secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrine of Isis in the desert beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second cataract, and whose touch brings</seg><seg type="columnLine">madness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment it looked at us, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly floated like a shining cloud through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway. From without came a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet chiming as of tiny golden bells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  O'Keefe leaped over the low parapet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor; sprang to the portal; peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She sent that!" he said with convic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, turning to me. "She sent it to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I caught a faint sardonic grin from Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hetzdorp, stepped out of the car, the Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man following, and began to ascend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved steps toward the oval opening, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of which O'Keefe and Olaf already</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. I hurried forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At first all that I could see was space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A space filled with the same coruscating</seg><seg type="columnLine">effulgence that pulsed about me. I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward, obeying that instinctive impulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of earth folk that bids them seek within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky for sources of light. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. All was a sparkling nebulosity rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">into infinite distances as the azure above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day-world seems to fill all the heavens.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through it ran pulsing waves and flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">javelin rays that were like shining shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the aurora; echoes, octaves lower, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those brilliant arpeggios and chords that</seg><seg type="columnLine">play about the poles. My eyes fell beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">its splendor; I started outward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now I saw, miles away, gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous cliffs springing sheer from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limits of a lake whose waters were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">milky opalescence. It was from these cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the spangled radiance came, shimmer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out from all their lustrous surfaces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To left and to right, as far as the eye could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, they stretched, and they vanished in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the auroral nebulosity on high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LOOK at that!" exclaimed Larry. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed his pointing finger. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the shining wall, stretched between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two colossal columns, hung an incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">veil; prismatic, gleaming with all the colors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the spectrum. It was like a web of rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows woven by the fingers of the daugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters of the Jinni. In front of it and a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">at each side was a semicircular pier, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">better, a plaza of what appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening, pale-yellow ivory. At each end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its half-circle clustered a few low-walled</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose-stone structures, each of them sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted by a number of high, slender pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nacles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of a hugeness, that!" It was Von Hetz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dorp. Have you considered that thosf</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipices must from eight to ten mile*</seg><seg type="columnLine">away be, Dr. Goodwin? And, if so, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">great must that so strange, prismatic cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that we see so clearly be, eh? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands could carve those columns between</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it hangs? It is in my mind that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will carry back with us many new things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Goodwin--if we carry back at all," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluded slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We looked at each other, helplessly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again through the opening. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing, as I have said, at its base. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall in which it was set was at least ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet thick, and so, of course, all that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see of that which was without were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distances that revealed themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the outer ledge of the oval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Let's take a look at what's under us.''</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Larry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crept out upon the ledge and peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, the rest of us following. We stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in utter silence. A hundred yards beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">us stretched gardens that must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">like those of many-columned Iram, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ancient Addite King had built for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure ages before the deluge. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Allah, so the Arab legend tells, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hid from man, within the Sahara, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond all hope of finding--jealous because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were more beautiful than his in para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dise. Within them flowers and groves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laced, fernlike trees, pillared pavilions</seg><seg type="columnLine">nestled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The trunks of the trees were of emerald,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vermilion, and of azure-blue, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blossoms, whose fragrance was borne to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, shone like jewels. The graceful pillars</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tinted delicately. I noted that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pavilions were double--in a way, two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">storied -- and that they were oddly</seg><seg type="columnLine">splotched with circles, with squares, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with oblongs of opacity. I noted, too, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">over many this opacity stretched like a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">roof.	.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet it did not seem material; rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it--impenetrable shadow!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down through this city of gardens ran ^</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad, shining green thoroughfare, *</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening like glass and spanned at regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar intervals with graceful, arched bridges.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The road flashed to a wide square, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose, from a base of that same silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone that formed the lip of the Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pool, a Titanic tower of seven terraces;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and along it flitted objects that bore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious resemblance to the shell of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nautilus. Within them were human figures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And upon tree-bordered promenades on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side walked others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far to the right we caught the glint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of another emerald paved road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And between the two the gardens grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetly down to the hither side of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">opalescent water across which were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiant cliffs and the curtain of mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus it was that we first saw the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Dweller; blessed and accursed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">no place on earth, or under or above earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">has ever been--or, that force willing which</seg><seg type="columnLine">some call God, ever again shall be!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gottt" whispered Von Hetzdorp.

Later I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to recall this odd observation, and Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hetzdorp was to remember, indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In single file, O'Keefe at the head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Olaf bringing up the rear, we passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the portal. Before us dropped a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular shaft, into which the light from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chamber of the oval streamed liquidly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in its sides, the steps spiraled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down them we went, cautiously. The stair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way ended in a circular well; silent, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no trace of exit. The rounded stones joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other evenly, hermetically. Carved on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the slabs was one of the five flow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered vines.

At the far end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this tunnel, whose floor was the polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock that had, a moment before, fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">hermetically into its roof, was a low, nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, triangular opening through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">light streamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nowhere to go but out!" grinned Larry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And I'll bet Golden Eyes is waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">us with a taxi!"

The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which we had come had vanished!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was only a precipice of pale rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on whose surfaces great patches of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amber moss hung; around whose base our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge ran, and whose summits, if summits</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had, were hidden, like the luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs, in the radiance above us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nowhere to go but ahead, and Golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eyes hasn't kept her date!" laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe--but somewhat grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We looked down. At the left the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadway curved, and, at least thirty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">below us, swept on. Far off to the right it</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerved again and continued as the glisten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing distant ribbon we had seen from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high oval. Within its loop, like a peninsula,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its foot bathed by the lake, lay the gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dened city.

Their drivers sat high upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward whorl. Their bodies were piled</seg><seg type="columnLine">high with cushions, upon which lay women</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-swathed in gay silken webs. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pavilioned gardens smaller channels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening green ran into the broad way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as usual automobile runways do;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in and out of them flashed the fairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a shout from one.

They were dwarfed--none of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than five feet high, prodigiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad of shoulder, clearly enormously</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trolde!" muttered Olaf, stepping be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side O'Keefe, pistol swinging free in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at the middle of the bridge the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader stopped, waved back his men, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came toward us alone, palms outstretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the immemorial, universal gesture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">truce. He paused, scanning us with mani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fest wonder; we returned the scrutiny with</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest. The dwarf's face was as white</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Olaf's--far whiter than those of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other three of us; the features clean-cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">and noble, almost classical; the wide set</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of a curious greenish gray and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black hair curling over his head like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">on some old Greek statue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dwarfed though he was, there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion of deformity about him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic shoulders were covered with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose green tunic that looked like fine linen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was caught in at the waist by a broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">girdle studded with what seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazonites. In it was thrust a long curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">poniard resembling the Malaysian kris. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs were swathed in the same green cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the upper garment. His feet were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandaled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My gaze returned to his face, and in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found something subtly disturbing; an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression of half-malicious gaiety that</seg><seg type="columnLine">underlay the wholly prepossessing features</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a vague threat. A mocking deviltry</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hinted at entire callousness to suffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing or sorrow; something of the spirit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was vaguely alien and disquieting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE SPOKE, and to my surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of the words were familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enable me clearly to catch the meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the whole.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">derisive gleam passed through his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.

"It sounds strangely, indeed--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange as your answers." He looked at us</seg><seg type="columnLine">quizzically. "I wonder where you learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it! Well, all that you can explain to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Afyo Maie." His head bowed and his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept out in a wide salaam. "Be pleased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come with me!" he ended abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In peace?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In peace," he replied.

"As</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as we're here let's see the sights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allons mon vieuxl" he called gaily to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green dwarf. The latter, understanding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit, if not the words, looked at O'feefe</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a twinkle of approval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He stood aside and waved a hand cour-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">teously, inviting us to pass. We reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge again; he spoke two words to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men, who immediately lined up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side of the arch, watching us as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked between them with that same sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion of expectant, malicious derision</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I found so disquieting in their leader.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We crossed.

The green dwarf</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved us to the piles of cushions and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself beside us. The vehicle started</seg><seg type="columnLine">off smoothly, the now silent throng mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing way, and swept down the green road-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way at a terrific pace and wholly without</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration, toward the seven-terraced tower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE TURNED abruptly and swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a runway through one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardens, and stopped softly before a pil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lared pavilion. I saw now that these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">much larger than I had thought. The struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture to which we had been carried covered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I estimated, fully an acre. Oblong, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its slender, vari-colored columns spaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularly, its walls were like the sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">screens of the Japanese. I had little time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to note them, nor, to my regret, to satisfy</seg><seg type="columnLine">my very eager curiosity as to the character</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trees and the beautiful bowering</seg><seg type="columnLine">blossoms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The green dwarf hurried us up a flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of broad steps flanked by great carved</seg><seg type="columnLine">serpents, winged and scaled.

I stretched, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntarily, my hand out toward it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt it quickly drawn back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Do you seek your end so soon?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered Rador.

At the side of the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood a smaller globe whose roseate gleam</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tempered by quivering waves of blue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enter Rador with the strangers!" a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, sweet voice called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rador bowed deeply and stood aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">motioning us to pass.

Her hair was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the color of the young tassels of the corn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--coiled in a regal crown above her</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, white brows. Her wide eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gray that could change to a corn-flower</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue and in anger deepen to purple. Gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">or blue, they had little laughing devils</seg><seg type="columnLine">within them, but when the storm of anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened them, they were no longer laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The silken web that half covered, hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed her did not hide the ivory white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of her flesh nor the sweet curve of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and breasts.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cruelty about the curving mouth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the music of her voice. Not conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruelty, but the more terrifying, careless</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruelty of nature itself.

And who or what were the Silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YOLARA'S eyes turned to Olaf, hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened, and grew cold gray. Subcon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciously I had noticed that from the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Norseman had been absorbed in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard of the pair; had indeed never taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gaze from them; had noticed, too, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priestess dart swift glances toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon Olaf's face had been an early look</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of puzzlement, of uncertainty.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze was fixed; he returned the woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny fearlessly; a touch of contempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the clear eyes--like a child watching a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snake which he did not dread, but whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger he well knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under that look Yolara stirred impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiently, sensing, I know, its meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why do you look at me so?" she cried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An expression of bewilderment passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Olaf's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not understand," he said in Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I caught a quickly repressed gleam in</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe's eyes.

The rosy, azure-shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe at her side suddenly dulled. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came a faint bell sound as of chimes far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. She bent over it. It vibrated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then its surface ran with little waves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull color. From it came a whispering so</seg><seg type="columnLine">low that I could not distinguish the words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if words they were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She spoke to the red dwarf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have brought the three who</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasphemed the Shining One," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly.

From without there came the rustle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many feet upon the rugs. Yolara pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slender hand upon the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedestal of the globe beside her. Abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light faded from all, and on the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant the four walls of blackness van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, revealing on two sides the lovely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfamiliar garden through the guarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of pillars. At our backs soft draper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies hid what lay beyond; before us, flanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by flowered screens, was the corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which we had entered, crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">now by the green dwarfs of the great hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE dwarfs advanced. Each, I now</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted, had the same clustering black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair of Rador. They separated, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them stepped three figures--a youth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">not more than twenty, short, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">great shoulders of all the males we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen of this race; a girl of seventeen, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">jdftged, white-faced, a head taller than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy, her long, black hair disheveled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clad in a simple white sleeveless gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that fell only to the knees. And be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind these two a stunted, gnarled shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose head was sunk deep between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous shoulders, whose white beard</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell like that of some ancient gnome down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his waist, and whose eyes were a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame of hate. The girl cast herself weep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the feet of the priestess; the youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded her curiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are Songar of the Lower Waters?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured Yolara almost caressingly. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is your daughter and her lover?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gnome nodded, the flame in his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping higher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has come to me that you three have</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared blaspheme the Shining One, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">priestess, and its Voice," went on Yolara</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly. "Also that you have called out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the three Silent Ones. Is it true?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your spies have spoken, and have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">not already judged us?" The voice of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old dwarf was bitter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A flicker shot through the eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Yolara, again cold gray. The girl reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trembling hand up to the hem of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">veils. She thrust it aside with her foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruelly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell us why you did these things, Son-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gar," she asked. "Why you did them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing well what your reward would be?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dwarf stiffened; he raised his with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered arms, and his eyes blazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because evil are your thoughts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil are your deeds," he cried. "Yours and</seg><seg type="columnLine">your lover's, there." He leveled a finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Lugur. "Because of the Shining One</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have made evil, too, and the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">wickedness you contemplate--you and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Shining One. But I tell you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">your measure of iniquity is full; the tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your sin near ended! Yea, the Silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones have been patient, but soon they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will speak." He pointed at us. "A sign are</seg><seg type="columnLine">they--a warning--harlot!" He spat the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In Yolara's eyes, grown black, the devils</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped unrestrained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it even so, Songar?" her voice ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ressed. "Now ask the Silent Ones to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">you! They sit afar, but surely they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear you." The sweet voice was mocking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"As for these two, they shall pray to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shining One for forgiveness, and surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Shining One will take them to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">bosom! As for you, you have lived long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, Songar! Pray to the Silent Ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Songar, and pass out into the nothingness</seg><seg type="columnLine">•--you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She dipped down into her bosom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew forth something that resembled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small cone of tarnished silver. She leveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, a covering clicked from its base, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of it darted a slender ray of intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">green light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It struck the old dwarf squarely over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart, and swift as light itself spread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering him with a gleaming, pale film.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She clenched her hand upon the cone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray disappeared; thrust it back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her breast and leaned forward expectantly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so Lugur and so the other dwarfs. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl came a low wail of anguish; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy dropped upon his knees, covering his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the moment the white beard stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid; then the robe that had covered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed- to melt away, revealing all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knotted, monstrous body. And in that body</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vibration began, increasing to incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidity. It wavered before us like a reflec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in a still pond stirred by a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind. It grew and grew, to a rhythm whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidity was intolerable to watch and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">still chained the eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The figure grew indistinct, misty. Tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparks in infinite numbers leaped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--like, I thought, the radiant shower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">particles hurled out by radium when seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the microscope. Mistier still it grew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then there trembled before us for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment a faintly luminous shadow which</seg><seg type="columnLine">held, here and there, tiny sparkling atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">like those that pulsed in the light about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. The glowing shadow vanished, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkling atoms were still for a moment--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then they shot away, joining those</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where the gnomelike form had been but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few seconds before--there was nothing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Keefe drew a long breath, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensible of a prickling along my scalp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yolara leaned toward us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have seen," she said. Her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingered tigerishly upon Olaf's pallid face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Heed!" she whispered. She turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in green, who were laughing softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">among themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take these two, and go!" she com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The justice of Lora," said the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarf.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand at his side made a swift, surrepti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious gesture, so fleeting that I hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught it. The red dwarf stared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German, and for the first time I saw com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete amazement upon his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced at Yolara, found her intent</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thought, and as swiftly as had been Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hetzdorp's action, returned it.

Upon its thresh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Rador paused, bowed deeply, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">motioned us within.

The fruits were as unfamiliar as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wine, and seemed to have the quality</seg><seg type="columnLine">of making one forget any desire for either</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh or vegetables. The green dwarf re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded us whimsically sipping from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great flagon of rock crystal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Much do I desire to know of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">world you came from," he said at last--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"through the rocks," he added mischiev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And much do we desire to know of this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world of yOurs, O Rador," I answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Should I ask him of the Dweller; seek</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him a clue to Throckmartin?

And once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">I obeyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> LET us learn, then, from each other."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The dwarf was laughing. "And first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are they all like you--drawn out?" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made an expressive gesture. "And are there</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are--" I hesitated, and at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke the Polynesian that means tens upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">tens multiplied indefinitely--"there are as</seg><seg type="columnLine">many as the drops of water in the lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw from the ledge where you found</seg><seg type="columnLine">us," I continued; "many as the leaves on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees without.

"And there is a third; but only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Larry leaned forward eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brown-haired with glints of ruddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bronze, golden eyed, and lovely as a dream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with long, slender, beautiful hands?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Where saw you her?" interrupted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarf, starting to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Saw- her?" Larry recovered himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nay, Rador, perhaps I only dreamed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was such a woman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "See to it, then, that you tell not your</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream to Yolara," said the dwarf grimly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For her I meant and her you have pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured is Lakla, the handmaiden to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Silent Ones, and neither Yolara or Lugur.</seg><seg type="columnLine">nay, nor the Shining One, love her over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">much, stranger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Does she dwell here?"

"The land where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwell with the Shining One stretches along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white waters for--" He used a phrase</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which I could make nothing. "Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">this city of the Shining One and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hither shores of the white waters dweil</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mayia ladala, the common ones." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a deep draft from his flagon. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are, first, the fair-haired ones, the children</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ancient rulers," he continued. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are, second, we the soldiers; and last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mayia ladala, who dig and till and weave</seg><seg type="columnLine">and toil and give our rulers and us their</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CONQUEST OF THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">daughters, and dance with the Shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">One!" he added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who rules?"

" He raised his voice in a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">great shout of mocking laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his words I caught a fleeting picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the race. An ancient, luxurious, close-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bred oligarchy clustered about some mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious deity; a soldier class that sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported them; and underneath all the toil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, oppressed hordes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And is that all?" asked Larry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he answered.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black Precipices of Doul are hard to pass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but none can pass through the feathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">serpents. And there is the Sea of Crimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">where--" he stopped abruptly, drank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set down his flagon empty. Whatever the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple drink might be, it was loosening</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green dwarf's tongue and neither of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us cared to interrupt him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is strange, strange indeed to be sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting with two who have newly come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that land that we were forced from so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many sais of laya agone," he began again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half musingly, gone upon another tangent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For we too came from your world, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">how long, long ago! I have heard that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters swept over us slowly, but dragging,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever dragging our land beneath them. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">we sought refuge in the secret heart of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, refusing to leave her. And at the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">we made our way here, where was the Shin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing One and where had been othersjjefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">us who had left behind them greater knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge than we brought--and that was no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">little, strangers. And now the laya turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon themselves. The tail of the serpent</seg><seg type="columnLine">coils close to his fangs." He took a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink of the yellow liquid; his eyes flashed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And without warning the globe beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">us sent out an almost vicious note.

Two cushioned couches were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and a curtained door leading into</seg><seg type="columnLine">an open, outer enclosure in which a foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain played within a wide pool of polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">green stone. Its opalescent column rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">high, and from it fell sprays of shimmer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, milky water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your bath," said Rador. He dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curtain and came back into the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He touched a carved flower at one side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a tiny sighing from overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and instantly across the top spread a veil</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blackness, impenetrable to light but cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly not to air, for through it pulsed lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle breaths of the garden fragrances. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">room filled with a cool twilight, refresh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, sleep-inducing. The green dwarf</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the couches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sleep!" he said.

Still</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing he vanished through the curtains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room of the fountain before I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask him the meaning of his curious gift,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its withdrawal and his most enigmatic clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing remarks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">108</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TROUBLE IS BREWING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OME stuff, that, green ray of Yo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lara's," said O'Keefe, deepest admir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation in his voice.

"When Lugur spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">that name I saw Von Hetzdorp signal him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thanaroa is, I suspect, the original form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the name of Tangaroa, the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">god of the Polynesians.

"How could they both</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The cult is a very ancient one. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly it had its origin in the dim be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginnings before these people migrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," I replied.

The ebon</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow had vanished from above and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room was pouring the silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.

I couldn't raise my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lids, but in some queerish way I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her. Then it got real dreamish.

They might have discerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light-spots dart back and forth, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, then up a way, and then descend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth. But it is not recorded that any</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was awake to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charles Avison unscrewed the round</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of the Vulcan and crept out. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly the light died from its windows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first he could not stand, but staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice and fell in a heap under the curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the machine. He lay a little while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then flashed his light about and into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of a great, deserted barn, in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which his machine had alighted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He climbed to his feet and steadied</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. After a little while he thrust his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder against the dark sphere arid</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled it as silently as a great snowball</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the high doorway. Then he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not far from morning," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked unsteadily toward the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Avison congratulated himself on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearness to home. A few hours before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had awakened from unconscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, he had been over water. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">risen from the bottom of the sphere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had fallen, with swimming head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drumming ears, and, getting his bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, had guided the machine toward home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His light was failing when he was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty miles away, however, so he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it safer to descend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His experiment had been a success!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he began to wonder what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred in that brief period of uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness. And was it so brief? His watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had said 3.40 just before he had fainted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 4.35 just after he had awakened. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it been one hour or twenty-five? His</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears still rang; he walked drunkenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat down in a fence-corner to await</seg><seg type="columnLine">daylight. He saw the stars--his compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions, he called them--begin to dim as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide ribbon of grayish blue showed aboye</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eastern horizon. He saw this ribbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">widen still more, and soon he could detect</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lines of his hands. At his feet were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers, wet with dew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Avison lighted a cigar, but he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly see the smoke in the bluish dawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But before the fire in it became too warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his fingers it was daylight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He arose and looked about. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place--he had driven along the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times in his car. He knew the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">barn where he had housed the Vulcan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long line of straggly telephone-poles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spinelike row of poplars beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just thirty miles to home and Agnes!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would start to walk to the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">railway station. Some friend in a car</seg><seg type="columnLine">would probably pick him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But somehow--Avison did not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how or what or why--something, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing did not seem natural. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be mistaken in the place; the trees, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farms, the houses, even the fence-posts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were familiar. But that queer, haunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of unfamiliarity remained; he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not shake it off. It must be that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet completely recovered from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started along the road. He laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he saw a deep rut that had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken a spring of his car. Here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muddy spot where a tiny creek seeped</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the highway. Here was the bridge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its familiar hole where Octavius, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorite horse, always shied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ringing in his ears had gone now;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked perfectly straight. His head no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer swam. But the feeling of alienation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as marked as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Avison became a little frightened, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he knew the road perfectly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested his knowledge. Soon he would arrive</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at the crossroads, where the lane turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">off toward the old Fair Grounds. Yes!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He catfte to the place just where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it would be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But why was it that everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same and yet different? He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the ruts of the road and the cract</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the telephone post where the lightning</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once struck. He knew the quiet fields</seg><seg type="columnLine">of grain, the pretty farm-homes, the horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fields. Yet he felt--he knew it now</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that something was terribly different.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw the farmers on their way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dairy barns. He heard the windmills</seg><seg type="columnLine">creaking, and the call of the hired men</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they hitched their teams to the farm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing implements. The world about him</seg><seg type="columnLine">was commonplace and ordinary, just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">always on a late spring morning in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. But he could not shake off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">illusive feeling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to; he tried to think of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. He whistled and smoked again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but found it useless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard an automobile behind him--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the commonplace honk! of the horn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chug of the engine! A touring car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing only a driver, came up to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The car stopped as Avison waved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you give me a lift?" the scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Avison took a seat beside the driver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked at him searchingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're Johnston, aren't you?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the car started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, but I don't remember you," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other man said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name is Avison--Charles Avison."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnston looked at him quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you Charles Avison?" he asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have heard of you many times."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stretched out a gauntleted hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found his companion's thin, long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingered one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can't be far from Smithford, can</seg><seg type="columnLine">we?" Avison asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smithford was a little town but a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from his home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About fifteen miles," replied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHO IS CHARLES AVISON?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">driver. "And what are you doing along</seg><seg type="columnLine">this road at this hour, may I ask?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Taking a morning walk," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE road was becoming more familiar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew many of the names that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw on the mail-boxes. He knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog that barked from the gateway of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmhouse--a dog that had always barked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. But yet he was perplexed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildered by the lingering sensation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfamiliarity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After ten miles the automobile slowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have to turn here," said Johnston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Which way are you going?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Straight on, I guess; and thank you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avison hopped out of the slowly mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing car, and started again down the dusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">road. He began to wonder why Johnston</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not recognized him; they had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other several times. Avison put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands to his face. He felt several days'</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth of hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, that was the reason. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed a shave very badly on the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his ascent, and in the five days at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least that he was in the air a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth had covered his cheeks and chin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And his face felt thinner; the bones pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon he passed a farmhouse--one where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had often stopped for a meal while</seg><seg type="columnLine">quail hunting. So he entered the gate;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was hungry for a warm breakfast again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew the dog that came to meet him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and patted its furry head. The old woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the doorway did not recognize him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told her what he wanted, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">led him to the kitchen. He washed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">basin at the back and looked at himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No wonder the others had not known</seg><seg type="columnLine">him! His face was much thinner; great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark bags hung beneath his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Who would have thought that the days</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air could have been such a physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain? His white, hollow cheeks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, black eyes, in contrast to tire black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair, shocked him. No wonder he remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown to Johnston and the woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the meal he asked but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">question, and it was a peculiar one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the date?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old woman looked up quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty-fourth," she replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Avison had gone up on the sixteenth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been two days unconscious!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And still the brooding strangeness per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexed and bewildered him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he was out on the road. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up another ride soon, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to Smithford, he took off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grease-stained clothes he had worn on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air journey. He laughed at himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the suit he had just bought. In bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of a hair-cut and shave, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">different clothes, he wondered if Agnes</seg><seg type="columnLine">would know him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The small town was at the end of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk. He could take the train from there</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his home. He walked about the town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although he was well known there and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many people looked at him interestedly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">none came up to speak to him. He laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself over the fact that even an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend did not know him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The train--the slow old train in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had so often ridden--pulled in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour later. By now it was noon; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avison place was scarcely a half-hour's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride away. He remembered the worn-out</seg><seg type="columnLine">plush on the seat of the cars, the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductor who punched his ticket. But always</seg><seg type="columnLine">something was not quite the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The trip has affected my mind," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could almost scream at the harass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of it all. He could not analyze or</seg><seg type="columnLine">place his finger on the difference, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there, it was everywhere! The change</seg><seg type="columnLine">of circumstance brooded about him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunted him and made him grip his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes widened at the thought of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was he asleep? Or hurt?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Or dead?--Dead! Anything was pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to him now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What if he were dead?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he laughed at himself for being</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fool. The laugh was hysterical; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train newsie eyed him suspiciously. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinched himself on the arm, and the hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">114</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was real. But something had changed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or changed the world in which he lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The train stopped at last at Avison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">own town, at the outskirts of which stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own house. Agnes lived here, too. Half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened, Avison wondered whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agnes would know him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it would be good sport if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he dropped into a second-hand store</seg><seg type="columnLine">and traded his trim cap for an old, bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered hat. This he pulled down over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, and started down the quiet street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some boys stared at him as he passed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one spoke in recognition. A dog that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew slunk away from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even the town was different!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes! The stores and the people and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fountains and the sparrows in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets and the signs were all the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every physical particular. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been change, and Avison swore at</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT a street-corner he saw a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men talking quietly. Although</seg><seg type="columnLine">they glanced at him, they did not speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. And yet he knew every one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he passed he heard his name men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned. He paused a minute as if to stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew it would happen some time,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Felix Barnes was saying. "I've told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him so a hundred times. But he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on making experiments. It's a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing his mother isn't alive. It would about</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And they say Agnes Cole is just pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated," said another of the group.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agnes Cole! Avison listened more at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The funeral procession ought to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon," said another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A ghastly feeling of sickness rose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avison. He clenched his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did it happen, anyway? Does</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody know?" asked a youth. "I just</seg><seg type="columnLine">got back to town, and this is the first I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From under his arm Barnes drew a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">folded newspaper, which he opened slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's the account--as much as an&gt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">one kiifljvs," he explained. "Avison wenl</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on the sixteenth for a four-day trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to Miss Cole. He had some</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme for beating gravity, mind you</seg><seg type="columnLine">Think of that--beating gravity!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Poor fellow!" murmured the youth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, they found his machine wreckec</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pieces just outside of town yesterday</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every bone in his body was broken. 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the crash myself when the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panic-stricken, Avison turned away. Hi</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinched himself again. His eyes were wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew. His scalp twitched. At a news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand he bought a paper, and feverishly</seg><seg type="columnLine">read of his own death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The machine, said the account, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken to pieces. The name plate, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which appeared the word</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Vulcan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had been found, however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wildly Avison grasped at every pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility that came to his mind. Coincidence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course. But what a devilish one! Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">aviator had been killed, so badly crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even his own family had mistaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">his identity. Avison mu$t hurry out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his home and tell his family that he lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must tell Agnes, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But was he alive?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He cursed himself as a fool for letting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question come to his mind. But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">did he know of the region and state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death? His eyes widened even more at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it couldn't be that--it couldn't!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pricked his chest with a pin. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pricked his hand till he brought blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came in sight of the old church</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had gone to Sunday school as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boy, and where his father had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. The old ivy-grown church,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its sleepy belfry and its quiet lawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Out in front were many carriages and</seg><seg type="columnLine">automobiles. The sound of singing came</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to him--a funeral dirge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHO IS CHARLES AVISON?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">115</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Avison hung back. He was afraid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on to that church.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What if the bo&lt;ly in the coffin should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be his?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He cursed himself again, and slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on. But he must see the dead man</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the coffin was closed! He began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to walk swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He climbed the steps and entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">church doors. It was filled with his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends. The sexton looked at him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not recognize him. Timidly he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, just beside an acquaintance. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was weeping quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The service was nearing its close when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avison entered. Almost at once the white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired old parson said that those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished might look again at the body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people stood up, the young scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them. AgneS in black, her face tear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained, was in front. Near her stood his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sister, weeping. He dared not approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. There was his uncle--all of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cousins. Slowly and wearily the train of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people began to walk past the long coffin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of black. Avison followed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What if it is?" he whispered. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gripped himself and resolved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his control. He came slowly up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the pall-bearers saw a young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end of the line--one who looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar, and yet whom they thought they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know; one who needed a shave</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wore a ridiculous suit of clothes--</seg><seg type="columnLine">clench his hands until the nails nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore the flesh, and go white as the flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">banked about the coffin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Avison rushed to the open air. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pressed his hands to his lips to sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press a scream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is I!" he moaned. "It is my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">body!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And winding away out of the town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the funeral procession had started for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">graveyard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CONSIDERING everything, - Avison</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept his self-control welL«_ He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved that he would not go insane. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been some monstrous coinci-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dence. That the smooth face in the coffin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not his own. But this reflection was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only thing that preserved his sanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That day passed, and that night, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still the young man did not sleep. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had secured a room in the hotel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tried to forget, in the smoke of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong cigars. That a ghost could smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigars! In the morning he slept a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That day his beard was longer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, and this, together with the thinness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his face, disguised him perfectly. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten he caught a train for a near-by city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he could think it out, away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agnes and his mourning relatives, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he felt a deadly fear of identifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the city he secured a hotel room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again tried to think. He was baffled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildered, afraid. The strangeness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything remained, but not in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked degree as in his home town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A coincidence," he kept repeating. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be! It can't be anything else!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a few days he began to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his science again. What if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken for dead? He himself knew now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was alive and well. He ate heartily</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the hotel grill; he saw an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">movie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But yet he could not go back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avison place nor to Agnes--at least until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the memory of the familiar face in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffin had faded from the minds of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">at home. He shut it out of his own mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he thought of his machine out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the great deserted barn. They had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wreck of the dead man's machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and machines do not have ghosts. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">more himself every day. Finally he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered that an observatory in connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with a great university was situated</seg><seg type="columnLine">just outside the city. So one day he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his beard and mustache trimmed, put on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large pair of dark glasses, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to talk to the head of the astronomy</seg><seg type="columnLine">department.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am Vunden, of Heidelberg," he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gray, the old astronomer, "and I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a position. The money part of it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">of no importance to me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">116</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This did not surprise Gray. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">many men on the faculty who worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">only for the love of it. He questioned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man, whose knowledge of the stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found amazing. So Gray procured</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Vunden" a position on a low salary, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avison went to work again at his old</seg><seg type="columnLine">love. It was only for a little while, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, until he could straighten out</seg><seg type="columnLine">things a little better in his mind. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">work might make him forget; at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would end the monotony of idleness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it came about that he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">long at the observatory. A few weeks after</seg><seg type="columnLine">he obtained his position there came an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eclipse of the sun. That noon, as Avison</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared into the eye-piece of the telescope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw for an instant at the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark rim of the nioon a new planet. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">significance of it struck Avison squarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat back, staring into space for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few seconds, then started up with raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. Gray, the old astronomer, found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him laughing and crying hysterically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter, Vunden?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Matter? Matter! Great Heavens!" be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan Avison excitedly. Then he calmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. "I have made the greatest dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery in the scientific world. I have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of them, in fact! But this one is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest in the history of astronomy! Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the telescope!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?'' questioned Gray as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjusted t^e glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" Avison rasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gray glanced a moment at the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">orb. The moon hid it as he watched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A new planet!" The old man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered. "Why has it never been seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face flamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can tell you why! It is in perpetual</seg><seg type="columnLine">eclipse by the sun just opposite from</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. The once or twice a year it is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">eclipsed, probably on account of the eclipse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth's course around the sun, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is too near the sun to be seen. Don't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand? Don't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh. I will tell you everything, soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But first tell me this: Along the twentieth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of May was there a kind of meteoric</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbance--a comet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How came you not to notice that? A</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor swept very near the earth. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. Let me go.

But a mimeograph copy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange letter came to every great</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist in the nation. And one letter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the original, came to one recipient who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a scientist at all. Agnes Cole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It made many a gray-haired astronomer</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake his head unbelievingly.

I became unconscious then. Why,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I do not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I see now what happened. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor carried me across that infinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanse to a point where the gravity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of I his world began to grip me. 1 began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remember now that when I wak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened the sea was below me.

The pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor acceding rather impatiently to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion, the change of footgear was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made and he departed.

It wasn't a very exciting beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a rule, but recently Danny had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">nursing hopes. As Miss Zapt had said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob that, afternoon, there had been a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of burglaries of late and Danny really</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't see why fate should not be kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and send one of the as yet unapprehended</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowlers into his quiet street. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking about it now as he listened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the patter of the rain among the leaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shure it would be a grand noght for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">poorch-climber to git in his fancy wuruk,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he soliloquized.

It sent him on down the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a wary eye for any burglarious-minded</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual who might have been of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same opinion as himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus he came in time to a house, \yith</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wide front porch, above which was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">open window; and rising over the top of'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the porch as Danny watched, an object</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a human head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a heart beginning to l^gat more</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, McGuiness drew into the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a tree and waited He knew this house</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as the home of Professor Xenophon Xerxes</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zapt, inhabited by the old man and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter. That open window and the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising cautiously over the edge of the porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof fitted in with the thoughts McGuiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been entertaining. He thrust his club</seg><seg type="columnLine">into its loop and felt for his revolver. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was convinced that at last he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given his chance to prove himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The head kept on rising. It was followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a crouching body, and a pair of legs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It became the figure of a man crawling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the porch toward the open window</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the silent caution of stealth. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">it appeared to hesitate, to slip on the slant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing surface, and then it again went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OFFICER McGUINESS had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough.

He shifted his position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving in until he stood close beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a most amazing situation.

The odd thing was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow didn't go any higher or even try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swim off. That was another thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danny couldn't understand.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thing was a bit too much for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you do ut?" he asked at length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't do it, you square-head."

The man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk a trifle nearer the earth after throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down whatever it was he had scraped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his clothing, and--there was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing the matter with his, Officer McGuin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ess's foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was exhibiting a most remarkable in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clination to rise into the air despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danny's efforts to keep it on the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was throwing him off his balance. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively he hopped sidewise to save him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self from falling, landed his one sane foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">in what might have been a mass of soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud on the grass under the eaves of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch, and became aware that it also had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone wild.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT ONCE Officer Dan McGuiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself in a most bewildering</seg><seg type="columnLine">rase. He had large feet, powerful, tireless in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path of duty, and the soles of his shoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of a large expanse. Yet, strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough now, those heavy feet seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken on a quality positively airy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strive as he would, they refused to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main on the grass. In desperation he tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">5 step and found himself unable to thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">either leg or foot downward to a contact</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the'earth. Still struggling against be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief he repeated the endeavor with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other foot and found himself mounting to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the level of the porch roof. Then and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">only did realization and acceptance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation come upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whu-roo!" He gave vent to a full-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toned Irish shout of comprehension and</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued his progress aloft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside the house as that shout woke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoes of the night, Miss Zapt pricked her</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty ears. "Bob," she said sharply, "what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sounded like a yell or a battle-cry or</seg><seg type="columnLine">something," Sargent made answer. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a notion I heard voices outside for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past few minutes. Maybe I'd better find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose, and Nellie followed him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hail. He opened the door and they both</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out on the porch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first they saw nothing, and then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruff voice drifted to them: "Lie shtill, ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">spalpeen. Ye tould me to come an' git ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">an', b&lt;gob, I hov. Quit yer squirmin' or</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll bust yer bean wid me club."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Bob!" Miss Zapt seized her com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion's arm. She had recognized those</seg><seg type="columnLine">stentorian tones: "That's Officer Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guiness. They--they must be on the roof."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Probably." Sargent went down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch steps before he lifted his eyes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he. too, gasped at what he beheld</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his voice came a bit unsteady. "Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord. Nellie! Look at that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lifted an arm and pointed to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danny, treading air very much as a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">treads water, was endeavoring to still the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggles of a human figure sprawled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">weirdly with its face to the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Zapt took one glance at the spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacle above her and shrieked: "Bob--</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'll be killed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came the click of the gate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little man with iron-gray whiskers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flapping frock-coat came up the walk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ahem," he said rather dryly, "just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the meaning of so excitable a statement?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who will be killed, may I ask?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Officer McGuiness and--somebody</seg><seg type="columnLine">else," Nellie stammered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh?" Professor Zapt stared, out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-sighted eyes. "Indeed? I fail to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive any indications of an impending</seg><seg type="columnLine">126</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy myself.

Once more Sargent pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh?" The professor tilted back his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head as Bob's arm rose. "Bless my soul!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he exclaimed and stared for at least fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen seconds before he raised his voice in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a question: "Officer McGuiness, exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">how did you get up there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny may have sensed the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those beneath him, but if so he had thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">far given no sign. Now, however, he man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to snap tile handcuffs on his man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilted his head and shot a glance at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An' is ut you, professor?" he replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shure, an' if it is how I got up here yer</seg><seg type="columnLine">askin' why I walked, though barrin' th'</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact how I done ut I dunno, except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this poorch-climbin' beauty floated offen</seg><seg type="columnLine">yer roof when I told him to come down,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	stepped into somethin' on th' grass.

"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Professor Xenophon Xerxes Zapt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Officer, this is most amazing. Let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">think--let me think." He made his way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the porch steps and found himself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If Lmoight be suggestin', sor, don't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinkin' too long at present." -Danny's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice came down in the tone of a plaint.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" 'Tis tiresome work entirely, this walkin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">on air.

"Keep your feet still</seg><seg type="columnLine">and float." He began pulling at his gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing whiskers as though minded to tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">them out by the roots. Presently he hopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, trotted a few steps down the walk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his eyes to the laboratory windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nodded. And then he turned to Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nellie.
