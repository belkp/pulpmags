            <seg type="columnLine">to bring him fabulous wealth, and on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his eternal gambling. He would bet on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">anything, and thousands went on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">races. He kept a stable, even, in a small</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">way--and he was the sort of man who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">must have his valet. How it would</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">who hoodwinked him into ruinous in-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "Never!" he protested.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "I have it!" he exclaimed, a sudden</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Her eyes flashed and a little cry of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pleasure escaped her. Instantly Ham-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mond realized that it had been in her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mind all the time--she wanted to wear</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">that gown, and he also resolved on the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "Hurry, little one," he said. "It is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to be a long, long evening, so we must</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "Jim," she said a bit shyly, "you're</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">such a dear to me. I--I could kiss you!"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "Why don't you?" he asked laughing-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ly, and catching her in his arms touched</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his lips gaily to hers. She drew away</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quickly. The touch of his lips had sent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a thrill through her slender frame, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that same kiss had aroused a new feel-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing in him. In that moment he suddenly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">realized that his one-time model was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">woman--a very pretty, charming woman</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at that.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> But she had already hurried away,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blushing prettily. In the little dressing-,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">room she was even then tenderly laying</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out the gown of the picture--that won-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">derful dress of black velvet that Ham-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mond had engaged a fashionable modiste</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to make to fit Fleurette. It had been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an eccentricity of his to have the gown</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">real as well as the model, and he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">carefully superintended its creation.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> In that instant another thought oc-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">curred to him. He liked to dress for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dinner and he knew, too, that it would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">please Fleurette if he did. So he re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tired to his own room and began to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">change. On the bureau stood another</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">photograph, and he looked curiously into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the woman's face as he dressed. He was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wondering if it would make a difference</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to her. Probably it would--if she ever</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knew--but she never would. In all the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time he had been in Paris, working to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make a name for himself, Jim Ham-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mond had never forgotten that he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">engaged to the girl in New York. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had written her regularly and her letters</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had always meant a great deal to him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> ITe had nothing to blame himself for,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the deception he meant to practice</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that evening was excusable, he told him-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">self, because of the pleasure it would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">give Fleurette. But somehow, as he told</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">himself this, the memory of the only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">kiss he had given her came freshly to his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mind--and he wondered--just a little.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> At last he was ready and stepped out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into the studio. There, standing before</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the open fire, was Fleurette. He gasped</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">as he looked at her. Naturally she had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">stood there in the light of the flickering</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fire, she was like another woman. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gown set off the curves of her figure to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wonderful advantage. Cut sharply away</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at the throat it exposed her snow-white</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">skin and outlined the perfect shoulders</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and throat. Her hair was charmingly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arranged and she had struck a rose amid</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the dark tresses.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "Fleurette!" he cried in admiration.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"You are wonderful!"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> She laughed delightedly. "You really</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">forward showed a dainty buckled slipper</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Impulsively he stepped beside her and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in surprise but did not attempt to draw</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away from him. For a moment he looked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into her eyes--and then he kissed her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eagerly. "You beautiful child!" he ex-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">claimed in enthusiasm. "You'll be the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> She only smiled and snuggled closer</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to him, just as his eyes wandered to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">picture in the silver frame. It sent an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unpleasant thought into his mind--a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sense of impatience with himself and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he gently pushed Fleurette away. She</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">looked up quickly, but he concealed his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought and at once suggested that they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hurry down to the taxicab he had sum-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> As the motor sped through the bright-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and Hammond felt better pleased with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">himself. She was going to enjoy the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">evening and he knew he would enjoy it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">because she did. And he said to himself</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that if the girl in the frame knew and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">understood, she, too, would approve. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">even thought that some day he might tell</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of velvety carpets and flowers and foun-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">tain, where the water rippled through a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">maze of varicolored lights. A waiter</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">obsequiously took their order, and with a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sense of pleasure Hammond observed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the .admiring glances of several men</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was familiar with the last salon made</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a startling discovery. In another mo-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Here was a choice bit of scandal indeed!</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Laughingly he whispered to Fleurette</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">what he had heard and her cheeks flushed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a little as she found herself so much ob-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">too, although she tried hard to appear</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">well party and as the dinner was served</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they grew carefree. Fleurette forgot</seg>
