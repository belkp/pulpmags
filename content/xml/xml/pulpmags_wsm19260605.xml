            <seg type="columnLine">around on his hurt leg, he waved the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">And if he was a bit grandiloquent in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Well he might be, I thought, for here</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was almost enough stuff to open a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> That, of course, was what one. could</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">out that we had no better destination.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">If he wanted to make money out of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was a Heaven-given opportunity for us.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Finally, he agreed with me, though I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">In the end, he decided that we would</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">didn't deter Sanja. He stripped off</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his clothes, tied up his long black hair</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in a handy knot--ridiculously as a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">with an Indian tongue. But then our</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of the prairies was inscribed upon us</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by Sanjo, as upon a slate, and we really</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> We learned that Sanja was a Man-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">they were still as brave as any people</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on ithe plains. Their enemies--who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were all the other neighboring red-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the Mandans and thinning their ranks,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">until finally the Mandans were no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">longer of a sufficient strength to rove</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">across the prairies, with men, women,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and children on the march. They</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could only send out small war parties,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or single scouts like himself, to do what</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">nTHE most imposing figure in the Crow Indian tribe is unquestionably Bear</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Tail, the lone surviving medicine man of the Crow people, living on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Crow reservation in Montana. He is held in great reverence by his fellow</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">redskins, especially by the older Indians of the Pryor district. Bear Tail's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prestige in this quarter arises from an incident that occurred five years ago</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when the Indians of Pryor Agency were planning an all-Indian rodeo. There</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were two factions interested in the rodeo, and, of course, one of these factions</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wanted to dominate the other and control the events. The faction to which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Bear Tail belonged was the weaker and failed to get the better of the various</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arguments that arose. After the manner of other races when disgruntled, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">worsted faction decided to ruin the rodeo, rather than have it conducted in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">accordance with the ideas of their adversaries.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> They therefore went into conclave with their medicine man, Bear Tail.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Although everything seemed ready on the morning of the day set for the big</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">show, Bear Tail came forward and warned the camp that there would be no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rodeo. The younger members of the tribe jeered at him and ridiculed his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prophecy.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> When it came near noon, and the active preparations for the rodeo became</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">manifest, Bear Tail went to his tepee, painted his face with weird designs in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brilliant colors, and covered his body with white clay. He then bade his squaw</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cover with mud the entire body of his pony, with the exception of its eyes,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nose, mouth, and ears. He also warned her to make the tepee fast, as a great</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">storm was coming.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> His next move was to mount his pony and ride through the camp, carrying</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his medicine staff and a willow whistle. He blew the whistle and chanted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">incantations, accompanied by pleading gestures toward Heaven. It is stated on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">good authority that, when Bear Tail left his tepee, the sun was high in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heavens and that the sky was cloudless. Everything seemed favorable for the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rodeo. Within a quarter of an hour of the time the medicine-making on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">part of Bear Tail was inaugurated, however, gusts of wind were tearing at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tepees, and in another five minutes, a gale was blowing. It blew harder and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">harder until every tepee finally went down and the rain was falling in drenching</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sheets. The rodeo did not take place, and as a result, Bear Tail acquired great</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prestige as one having unusual influence with the gods who make wind and rain</seg>
