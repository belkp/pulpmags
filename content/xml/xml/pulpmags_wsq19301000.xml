            <seg type="columnLine">He crept into the narrow room, aft in the rocket,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Obviously this trapdoor in the floor opened into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a cellar, or possibly a treasure vault. A naus-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">kept me from looking directly into it. At a slant,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">however, the subterranean chamber appeared as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dark as midnight. For the foliage shaded the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">through which even dim light could reach the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">realized the moment the gleam of its eyes met</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mine, and I caught the gleam just as La Blanca</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">screamed. It was the scream, however, and not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the gleam that made me leap sideways; for there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was a fascinating power in those evil eyes, which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would have held me an instant too long, if she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had not screamed. Having leaped, I looked--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw the horrible head settle back into the hole--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and turned toward La Blanca. My God! I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would show her how grateful I was to her for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">keeping watch. In some way, I would show her.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">She was not there! On the limb, where she had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">from her skirt. Under the limb, however, I found</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her, lying unconscious on the ground. Had she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fainted and fallen? Naturally, what woman</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would not? I picked her up as tenderly as pos-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">her white face with water. But, instead of recov-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ering calmly, she awoke in a frenzy of fear. The</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">supposed, by the bark on the limb as she fell,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but she quickly convinced me they had been made</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Learning Ali was our servant she questioned</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">something in my hand in which I had implicit</seg>
