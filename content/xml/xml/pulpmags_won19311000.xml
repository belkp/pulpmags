            <seg type="columnLine">forms I had met on the road were a sort of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">motor bus. Perhaps each of the cylinders</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they carried was filled with water and con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tained a living creature in the act of being</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">transported to another lake or river.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> A thousand questions thronged my mind,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but after a moment I resolutely set them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">aside. The really important question was:</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when did I eat? I was hungry. I was, in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fact, very hungry, and I had not the slight-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">est idea where my dinner was coming from.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I had not given much thought to the matter</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">before, but I now saw that my situation</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">might be serious. As I have mentioned, I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had seen no game, nor anything else of an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">edible nature. The problem of food would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">soon be an important one.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> But at this moment, happening to glance</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up the road, my eye fell upon one of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moving platforms. It was only a couple of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hundred yards away, coming toward me,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and was loaded in the same manner as those</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I had seen earlier. In the brief time before</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it reached me my decision was made. I was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">going to have a look at what those cylin-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">AS I had hoped, when the machine came</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">near to the water's edge, it slowed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down, and as it went by I managed to poke</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one of the cylinders free with my rifle. It</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rolled off onto the beach. It was about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two feet in diameter, and when I had stood</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it upright it came to my shoulder. But the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cover would not come off.. I struggled un-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">successfully with it for several minutes and</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">then stopped to rest. As I was about to make</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a second attack the difficulty was unexpect-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">edly solved. A loud buzzing sound from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the interior of the cylinder caused me to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">jump back in alarm. The cover began to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">move. It revolved rapidly for a few seconds</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then fell off. I slipped the safety of my</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rifle, approached cautiously, and peered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over the edge.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> I do not know just what I expected to see</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">--a fish of some sort, perhaps, or an octopus</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">gusted, I gave it a push. It toppled over</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at the lake's margin and the water gushed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forth. But the next instant there was a ter-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">occurred on the same night that sawr--the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">final disappearance of Loren's cabin. A</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">few days later I took time to make a trip</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">north. I found, as I had expected, that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ruins of the laboratory were only half</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a dozen miles from the site of Loren's camp.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">His choice of this isolated location had evi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dently been due to the fact that it was the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">intersection of three cross-state trunk power</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lines. It was undoubtedly this fire that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Loren and I had seen that night.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> These facts at last enabled me to form</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an explanation of the puzzle that had gone</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unsolved for 30 years. I think I know now</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pretty much what happened.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> As I may have mentioned previously,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Loren's cabin stood on top of a hill, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">highest in several miles. Scanlon's appar-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">atus must have produced a beam of some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sort which, either by accident or design,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was so pointed that it just grazed the top of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the hill before passing out into space. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beam had the property of causing objects</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that it encountered to vibrate at such an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">enormous frequency as to produce in these</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">objects an infinite Fitzgerald contraction.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The cabin and its contents were, of course,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thus affected.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Now an object to which this happened</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would not be destroyed; it would still re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">main a real, material body. But--it would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">no longer have three dimensions, but only</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Now it is obviously impossible for a two-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dimensional object to exist in a three-di-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mensional world, and I believe that the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">cussed in "The Reader Speaks" column without giving</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">satisfactory explanations of those ideas. Most authors</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">are content to invent time machines of all sizes and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">imagination happens to be poor, the story may be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spoiled as far as he is concerned. Henry F. Kirkham,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for instance, enters into an exceedingly long-winded,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">supposed explanation of the time machine in his story,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Tho Time Oscillator", which conveys very little to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mind of the reader and merely fills space.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Almost all authors consider time as being a dimen-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sion, preferably the fourth. It appears to me that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">these authors have not thought very much about time</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for if they had, they would not have chosen the fourth</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">reason is that if time is imagined to be a dimension,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">IT BECOMES PART OF SPACE I The leading phy-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sicists of today believe that time and space are separate</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">only one answer. Yet authors persist in employing</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The point I wish to emphasize is that all time travel-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Kirkham, however, seems to be definitely at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fault in one place. It is obviously impossible for a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing to exist before it begins to do so. Yet in Mr.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Kirkham's "Time Oscillator", the time machine which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was completed some time after 1900 A.D., goes back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to several thousand years B.C. At the time of Atlan-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">metal at the same time that it was in the ground as ore.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">This same error is true of other authors. I suppose</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the sole reply to this accusation is that the author of a</seg>
