They began to shout:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pirate! Samothracian! Traitor!

It provided absolute privacy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even its flower-carpeted banks were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible until the barge had gone beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and turned, and approached from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southward, the thump of the oars</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarming myriads of water-fowl that took</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing from the reeds and filled the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">with weird music.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the first sight was of naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greek girls, some bathing and others</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing games against a background of</seg><seg type="columnLine">marbled terraces and columned pavil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions. There was not a man in sight, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a eunuch, except for a guardboat</seg><seg type="columnLine">half hidden in a water-lane between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were probably several guard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats, but only one was visible. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">attendants on the boat-jetty were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Egyptian slave-girls, dog-eyed, bare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breasted. Their white teeth flashed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensuous smiles. Their dark skins were</seg><seg type="columnLine">like shadows against the sunlit marble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They made the boat fast. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke to Tros. As he walked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble path, between flowers, the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of girls' laughter didn't cease for an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant. Even when the path skirted one</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the terrace on which the naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls were playing, and he was in full</seg><seg type="columnLine">view, no one stared at him. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least half of those girls--knew their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fathers and mothers: they were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cream of the Alexandrine aristocracy; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been offered his pick of them, dozens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of times, by a court chamberlain who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been delighted to ally him</seg><seg type="columnLine">by marriage with the ascendant political</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction. But he might have been invis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible for all the notice they took.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first greeting he received, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the steps, on the terrace in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pavilion door, was from the Lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charmion, looking like one of the Fates</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her needle and thread and her vine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gary air of prim chastity in classically</seg><seg type="columnLine">draped white Chinese silk. She looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from her sewing to answer his bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The queen expects you. You may go</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight in.

She almost spat the word. "Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and try to redeem yourself!

Three ladies-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in-waiting, who were doing embroidery-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work with Charmion, and pretending to</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it, giggled. Tros nodded to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entered the pavilion, down a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor where seven eunuchs sat on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gilded bench, whispering and smirking</seg><seg type="columnLine">like priests in a vestry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of them opened a door, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time some one called Tros</seg><seg type="columnLine">by name. The child Caesarion, a brat</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly able to toddle, but precocious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looking already like a miniature</seg><seg type="columnLine">copy of Julius Caesar, ran through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway and fell at his feet, seizing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs and calling him "Twos of Sam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">othwakee." There was at any rate some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one pleased to see him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the child was swept up by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">protesting nurse and borne off, yelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his hero. Then a golden voice, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no equal, anywhere:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may come in."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE EUNUCH closed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door behind him and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone with the queen. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in one of her strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic moods that nobody ever knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to divine--greenish eyes, brooding</seg><seg type="columnLine">--rather sensuous lips, smiling--looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller than ever, because she was seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a huge chair facing the view through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her exquisitely shapely feet, touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">with henna, in gold-leafed sandals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on a footstool of carved ivory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the table beside her were pen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ink and a number of parchment scrolls</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fluttered in the slight breeze; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a long table against the wall were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of objects obviously rifled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ancient tomb. In her hands was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden bracelet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tros caught his breath. He bowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, with his eyes on the bracelet. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not Egyptian.

And then action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He marched away into the night, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor because dark Rhakotis was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of daggers as mongrel dogs. His ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jew bodyguard trudged at his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conops strode beside him, wise in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the by-ways, familiar with every bawdy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and tavern from wharf-side to city</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, and from the wall to the slums</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond it, amid the slaughter-yards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave-barracks, native Egyptian mud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick huts and factories, along the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Necropolis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First, they entered a tavern called the</seg><seg type="columnLine">House of Carousal, that twanged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">zither-music and swished with the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citing hiss of shaken sistra, in a reek</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wine-fumes.

But he showed his teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Tros shook off a dozen dancing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls who tried to cling to his arms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pull off his armor and persuade him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay and be entertained. Tros came</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood in front of him. Ahiram forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">his manners:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Teeth of a yellow cur!

The lord captain had</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised the wind would blow them up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river, and he might be right again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they had heard stories of whirlpools,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapids, cataracts, and of many a ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sailed up-Nile but had never come</seg><seg type="columnLine">home again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It made no difference to men recover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from drink, and totally ignorant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their destination or the purpose of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition, that they kept continually</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing laden barges, all from the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The south was an ominous mystery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their heads ached. They made very</seg><seg type="columnLine">little conversation, and kept the flotilla</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely enough spaced to satisfy even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lord captain's demands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was nearly low-Nile and the current</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sluggish. When the wind failed, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">bends of the river or in the lee of culti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vated islands, the rowing was not par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly hard work. But it was mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailing; and at night-fall, when Tros</seg><seg type="columnLine">called a halt at the site of a very ruinous</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple, there was less than fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes between the leading and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last boat, and every one was cheerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">except Aristobolus, whose hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer bound, but who had spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly sixteen hours in Conops' company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked, by that time, as if he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">prefer to be talked to by sepulchral</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghouls or devils from the world beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sources of the Nile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Nile was Main Street. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing through the richest and most</seg><seg type="columnLine">densely populated cultivated zone on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, where there were villages every</seg><seg type="columnLine">few miles and even the reeds were har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vested for fuel. There was a continual</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of north-bound traffic. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason why they had that reedy bivouac</seg><seg type="columnLine">to themselves was because the spirits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ancient dead were said to haunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The evening wind in the reeds, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustling of the night-fowl and the eerie</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness of Egyptian night combined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">create terror. There were hermits, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge owls, in the ruins. Two of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bald, scrawny old females--speech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly, piously lousy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men refused to sleep ashore; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate their meal in a hurry, in silence, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled back into the boats. They implored</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tros not to risk his life in the ruined</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple precincts. But he ordered Conops</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a squad to sweep the fleas and bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">filth from a stone-paved chamber, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there he lit a fire and invited Aristobolus</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Alexis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two Alexandrines eyed each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">with alert suspicion. They ate in silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except when Alexis complained of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of a servant to wash him and bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a change of linen; if he had no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, he had been too lazy to unpack</seg><seg type="columnLine">his enormous roll of bedding and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longings. They omitted to drink to each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, even when Tros poured the wine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made a hospitable gesture to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, Alexis had been in the lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing boat. Tros had talked to him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well primed--knew what was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected of him. So, as soon as the meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finished, Tros went out to wash</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and to post sentries and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that the boats were well moored. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took plenty of time about it, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he returned the two men appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLEOPATRA'S PROMISE</seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg><seg type="columnLine">not exactly friendly but to have reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here," said Aristobolus, "your</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Conops has been telling me all day</seg><seg type="columnLine">long that you're at logger-heads with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen--that you only escaped death by</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumping off the royal barge and swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming. That confirms what I told him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you--that you are on the proscrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion list. Am I right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had a narrower escape from four</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your freedmen!" Tros answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So? What happened?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What will happen to you also, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">you obey me--in thought, speech, action,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the very manner of your gestures!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will presently say what I wish you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do.

Tros asked him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sacrament of Isis!

Was there time, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, with the queen's spies every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, to tell you all the details of a plot</seg><seg type="columnLine">that has taken us weeks to contrive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after months of study?

And consider now how you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I saved you from the queen's men,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tros answered.

You have told my</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Conops the story of Boidion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conops has told me. Has our friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alexis heard it?

Tros</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Garbage! Army contract garbage!</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the past year I have had all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">meals at the royal table.

I spoke of Boidion?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, her? Well, Boidion has the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage, from our viewpoint, that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">has never been Queen of Egypt, whereas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arsinoe has been. Arsinoe, it is true,</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't last long. Caesar, to use his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">phrase, readjusted her condition to</seg><seg type="columnLine">comply with custom and the law of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Egypt. Damned old humbug! What was</seg><seg type="columnLine">he doing in Egypt? However, Arsinoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">had time to learn more than a little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when they know too much, they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Witness our present queen.

That is why, hitherto, I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">set my face against Arsinoe and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to be what is known as loyal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Boidion, who is said to resemble</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arsinoe so closely that they look like</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other's reflection in a mirror, might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be--I say might be--a shrewd man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture. Anyway, what choice have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Aristobolus, with your names on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen's list?</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You already know my mind," Tros</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered, and they nodded.

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am superstitious. I don't like to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">oaths about dying. Death is a damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasant event that will occur too</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon, no matter when."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Tros' turn. "By my own good</seg><seg type="columnLine">name, and for my soul's sake, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sake of Egypt, I will do my best</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Queen Arsinoe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You talk like a shaveling priest, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stormy war-horse!" said Alexis. "Soul?</seg><seg type="columnLine">How much for it?

What</seg><seg type="columnLine">now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know where to find her?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tros asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aristobolus perceived his value.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do I?

He made no other comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are to go on ahead of you?" Aris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobolus asked. "How then will you find</seg><seg type="columnLine">us? We are likely to be difficult to fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. There are no streets in the desert.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And," he added slowly, "we should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel--shall I call it fortunate?--if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">should turn aside, or retreat, and leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">us trying to explain to desperate ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turers why we have brought them false</seg><seg type="columnLine">news.

It was after sunset when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted, seemed to me, eight-and-thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows, pretty well tuckered, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">herded out of a hole in the ground--</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe a tomb--toward that place I just</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you. By the time I was down off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pyramid--it's a long run around</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rear, and me as thirsty as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt fish--they were all inside the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I couldn't get by the soldiers.

From the temple there's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">road that leads to Memphis. You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the roofs of Memphis. It's a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">city.

If our Northmen are</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, I couldn't swear to it. I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see 'em. They were down in a hole in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground before I got there, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dark before they let 'em out.

I jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the top of the bank, being scared</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' snakes, and fell right over her. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled off quick.

It looked like a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to Memphis, and the land looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as dead as the bones of death itself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deathly quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     SUDDENLY he saw what</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him bless the moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were men on the march</seg><seg type="columnLine">--southward--away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyramids--not along the road to Mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phis, but toward what appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">low ground, with what might be the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a building barely visible, about mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way between Memphis and the Nile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even with a seaman's eyes it was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to judge direction or distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was impossible to count the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marching men because of the shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">they cast, but they might be a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred, a few more or a few less, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers on little bits of horses.

Was the Boidion story a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mare's nest? Or had Conops mistaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boidion for Arsinoe? Tarquinius the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etruscan might easily have given Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinoe's armor to Boidion, and might eas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily have informed her well enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">call Conops by name. According to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Couops the girl had said very little--</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps from fear of self-betrayal.

Four or five hundred men might</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily take Memphis; there would only</seg><seg type="columnLine">be police, and perhaps a few officers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rabble of impressed, hurriedly armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens to be overwhelmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Were the Northmen with her?

Tros returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men, but he couldn't get volunteers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cross the moonlit waste of sand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set fire to the soldiers' barracks; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were overawed by the monstrous pyra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid that loomed and seemed to lean</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the starry sky. He had to pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen men and lead them himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fired the roof-thatch with his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. Then, as the dry stuff caught and</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared skyward, all the laborers stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peded from the other barrack--fled like</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghosts, scattering.

With his</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened squad behind him he crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moonlit open ground and strode into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He almost jumped out of his armor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It took every scrap of iron self-control</seg><seg type="columnLine">he owned to stand still and not show</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself stunned with astonishment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hail! Hail! Hail!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tros! Tros! Tros!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eight-and-thirty battle-axes swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloft^and trembled to the thrill of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner's welcome. Seven-and-thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northmen, bearded, unkempt, lean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in line behind Sigurdsen, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader. All Tros' other men had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranks; they had become an almost in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible audience that crowded to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what would happen. They could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tros' face; his feet were in shadow, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in moonlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During six full seconds he stood rigid</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hand at the salute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am glad," he said then, holding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice to the gruff, unemotional note that</seg><seg type="columnLine">carries home the full weight of a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">good faith and will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he went and shook hands with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sigurdsen, who had ruled a tiny Baltic</seg><seg type="columnLine">kingdom until the day when Tros met</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in single combat and beat him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees. He was older than Tros and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a full head taller. He was sobbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tros punched him, friendly fashion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then walked along the line to shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands with each in turn, until, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the line, he came to Angsgar the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skald, a shorter, thick-set, thoughtful</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking man. Tros laughed then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gold-beater!" he said. "Bracelet</seg><seg type="columnLine">maker!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, Lord Captain. A heavy brace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let is a better weapon than a dagger on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dark night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was dark until I set eyes on it,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tros answered. "That was good work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angsgar."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He returned to his place in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and stood staring. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one else in armor, out in front, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Sigurdsen, about six paces from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, on his right hand--perhaps even</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly in front of Sigurdsen--small as</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared to those Northmen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLEOPATRA'S PROMISE</seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight, but very straight in armor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whoever it was--and Tros knew who</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was--had stood there from the first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Tros had chosen not to see. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what courtesy demanded, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">common kindness. But his quick wit</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed him. He stood silent until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon's rim rose above the pyramid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight shone on the crestless helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the pale, girl's face beneath. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed a senseless question, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had chosen it from half a hundred oth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers that he might have asked--that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have liked to ask.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She answered in a good round fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Arsinoe, the captain of your North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the Queen of Egypt's name, I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in Salamis, Queen of Cyprus!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I prefer to command your North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are my prisoner!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well.

Since his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baltic wife died on a beach in Gaul he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never seen a woman whom he liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he did this one. But what could he</seg><seg type="columnLine">do with her? How save her from Cleo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patra's malice?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I gave you one chance," he said, "to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die in battle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed.

They obeyed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None needed to be told they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in deadly danger, but now it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangible and they understood it. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no supplies. No archer had more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than fifty arrows. Their line of retreat</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the boats could be cut, and the boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">couid be seized or scuttled easily, by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere raiding party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They followed Tros--first the North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, then Arsinoe's four-and-twenty pi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates, then the flotilla's crew--in column</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fours into the walled enclosure.

He had decided to wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conops, who might bring reliable infor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation. He posted his sentries, sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned the men with the sharpest eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred feet up the flank of the pyra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid that Conops had climbed, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned for the inevitable drum-head</seg><seg type="columnLine">council. He would have preferred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">postpone it, but there was no avoiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">a talk with Arsinoe. As he knew from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the experience in Cyprus, she was capa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble of day-long silences; but she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">also capable of forcing issues.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were squatting around it, two deep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had left a space for Tros, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">box to sit on, so he sat and faced Sigurd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sigurdsen and Angsgar the skald were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only two who could talk Greek flu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently, and it was useless to expect a</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain tale from Angsgar; runes were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready running in his mind; he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently sing a story, in which facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">would merely be the seeds of splendid</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angsgar was an artist--Sigurdsen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pessimist, who battle-axed the truth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay bare gloom, on which to base a mood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of melancholy discontent: a loyal man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhappy unless he had something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grumble about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a long box that they had laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom upward. Arsinoe came and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside Tros. She laid her helmet on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box between them and her coppery-</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden hair fell loose on her shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She sat with a sword between her knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said nothing to Tros, who did his</seg><seg type="columnLine">best to pretend she was not there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And so now we all die," said Sigurd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sen. "It is a bad end, to be buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">among these mummies, in a land where</seg><seg type="columnLine">no man's word is worth the breath he</seg><seg type="columnLine">uses. But it is good that you came,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tros. We had given up hope of ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing you, until she came. They told</seg><seg type="columnLine">us you had gone to sea and left us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our fate. We had to dig, or die of hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger. And at night they chained us. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">because we were chained the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew careless, and we were making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan for escape to the Nile, when her</seg><seg type="columnLine">man came from over-river, and stole</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dark, spying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He had word with us; and when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned whose men we are, he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fight off Salamis, and how you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given your prisoners, of whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one, to her. And he said she needs</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who will fight to the death. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more also he said. We bade him</seg><seg type="columnLine">take back word to her that if we can we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will escape across the Nile. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went, and we made a new plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So tonight, when it was time to cease</seg><seg type="columnLine">work in the tomb, and the commander</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guards came and offered us free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom if we will march under his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand in an assault on Memphis, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove him forth with our picks and shov-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> els. So he summoned men and they tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill us all, but we were hard to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">at. So they tried to bury us alive. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they let in not enough sand, and we dug</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way out, in darkness. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">marching away, so we lay still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then she came. And she said she has</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of you, and of your coming. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that, we became like men who are</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk with strong drink. So we ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed her captain, being, as I say, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">men drunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we hid, because you came so</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon that we doubted it could be you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We crept near in the darkness. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">while you were burning the barracks we</seg><seg type="columnLine">called some of the seamen by name, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew us. And now you know all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saving what she told us. Let her tell it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Though I die for it, I will not," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arsinoe, "unless Lord Captain Tros him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self asks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it pleases you," he said, "be silent."</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the space of at least a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no other sound than bated</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing. Then Arsinoe spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well. Here is my sword. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want my armor? If you propose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence me forever, cut my throat now!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stood up. So did Tros. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging with emotion that felt like anger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as such he used it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Princess, I left you in Cyprus, well</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided. Is it your idea of gratitude to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come and raise this--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quite suddenly he realized he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry. It was another emotion, less fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar, less easy to govern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But since you have come," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"be seated. Tell me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed. They sat down again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by side. Her laugh was rather dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerting; she had Cleopatra's gift of</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing through a man and of understand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his motives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord Captain Tros," she said quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"do you wish to be King of Egypt?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neither do I wish to be Queen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLEOPATRA'S PROMISE</seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cyprus, so perhaps we can understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you think to win Egypt with</seg><seg type="columnLine">two dozen men?" he asked her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was Queen of Egypt once," she an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered.

Even as you, I am here to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove my spirit and to die if need be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You have heard of Boidion?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tros nodded. She seemed to wish to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be questioned, but he waited, and pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently she continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She is at that temple, up-river. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">has called herself Arsinoe, or has let</seg><seg type="columnLine">them call her so. She believes me dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">--or did believe it. That Etruscan jackal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lars Tarquinius. whom you left to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand my bodyguard--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tros interrupted. "Ahenobarbus did</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed again, delighted to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tros on the defensive. But he made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">further comment, so she continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lars Tarquinius, who is such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jackal that he would betray himself, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no one else to betray, began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak to me of Boidion before you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone an hour from Salamis. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested to me that we should encour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age Boidion to make a raid on Egypt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling herself Arsinoe; and it was clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the plot had long been cooking. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to lie low, in hiding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, should Boidion succeed in rais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a real rebellion, I should hasten to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Egypt, and they would murder Boidion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set me on the throne. But if Boidion</seg><seg type="columnLine">should fail, then I should come out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding in Cyprus and denounce her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all would be well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a very intelligent plot, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved to me that Herod, and even Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sius, would lend aid. But I said no to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I care nothing for Boidion. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should I? But I would not trust Tar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quinius. And since you and I talked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salamis I had lost my craving to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Queen of Egypt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should have died that night, I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose, because the plot was well forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tarquinius not to be balked. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">his avarice saved me. He believed he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could sell me to Herod; and the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom you had given me were all cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured pirates, who understood that busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. So he told them they might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, to take to Delos, where the slave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchant Hipponax would know how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get in communication with Herod. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">he furnished a boat, in which they put</seg><seg type="columnLine">me at night with two women. And we</seg><seg type="columnLine">set sail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they were my men. It was my</seg><seg type="columnLine">task to prove it. I did, and it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so difficult, for they had seen me fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">against them, on your ship. And they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as weary of being pirates as I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary of being used as a pawn in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">game by scoundrels and cowards. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made them promise, and I said I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring them to you if I could do it. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, I did not dare to go to Alex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">andria; nor did I dare to write to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more than I did write, for fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cleopatra might lay her hands on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter, and suspect you, and have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">put to death. I know my sister!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Words you had said to me burned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind. I might have sent a letter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">expose the plot, and thus I might even</seg><seg type="columnLine">have bought Cleopatra's friendship. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had made up my mind what I want,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I knew it might not be had by be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trayals and writing letters. It was my</seg><seg type="columnLine">name they were misusing. It was me</seg><seg type="columnLine">they should deal with. It was I who</seg><seg type="columnLine">should do as you would do and play my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own hand against whatever odds des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny sends. I would deal face to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Boidion and her masters, who she</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably supposes are her servants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So we came to Pelusium, pretending</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a slave ship, because the slavers</seg><seg type="columnLine">can come and go where it is unsafe for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one else. Old Esias Avas at Pelusium."</seg><seg type="columnLine">TROS whistled softly to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Careful Esias had played</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe, had he? Always on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winning side, Esias, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">never to be caught in an intrigue, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he never did too much, nor too</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Esias was awfully afraid. But I sold</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the vessel and borrowed money</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him--quite a lot of money. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost caught in Pelusium, because I</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid my men and they got drunk. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esias hid me, and sent his slaves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">round them up. And it was from Esias</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I learned how Boidion had crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desert, and how the border patrol</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been bribed to know nothing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. She had gone up the eastern branch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Nile, she and her party, in a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of vessels that belong to the priests</seg><seg type="columnLine">and are not subject to search.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I bought equipment in Pelusium--</seg><seg type="columnLine">black Arabian tents and many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. I, and my two women, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">four-and-twenty men went up the Nile</seg><seg type="columnLine">in laden barges to Heliopolis. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy for my men to pretend they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">travelers on the way to Arabia. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioned them. And as for me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my women, we were wives of Memphis</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchants on our way home. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought two men-slaves in Pelusium, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very high price, because Esias recom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mended them; so that we looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">respectable women. They are very good</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves. They have been spying for me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They brought me news of the arrival of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alexis and Aristobolus; and I knew then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would not be long before they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">march on Memphis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know Alexis?" Tros asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. But Tarquinius told me his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name, as one who is in Cleopatra's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence but who is the actual first in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor of the plot to make use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boidion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was camped on the far bank, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I daresay Conops told you. I bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">camels. They are there now. Conops</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to steal my boats. I didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Conops--not then. But, as Sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urdsen has told you, one of my men</seg><seg type="columnLine">came spying here and brought back</seg><seg type="columnLine">word; so I decided to come here, at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">risks, and to try to rescue these North-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and perhaps also to win over some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the soldiers. I found Conops' boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this side of the river, and the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he had left to guard it talked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">children, because they had seen me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle on your ship. So I knew you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming. And then Conops nearly killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me by accident. And where the faith-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful dog is, his master is not far distant."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh-heh! Number One!

Then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's master?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This way!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten men reeled through the open gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind another who was bow-legged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly higher than the others' shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. Then Conops' unmistakable voice:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Halt! 'Ten-shun! Fall out now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get yourselves a drink. Then down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatch for a couple o' snores and sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">like dead men! You'll be needed at day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">break, sure as death. Stand at ease!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stand easy! Fall away!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shoved himself a passage between</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated men and stood with his back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire, saluting Tros, but he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his one eye off the Northmen. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced sideways. He was grinning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well? What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did it, master! It was easy. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on the march already, direction o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Memphis. Nothing but a lot o' lousy</seg><seg type="columnLine">priests to interfere with us. So we burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pier, too. Scuttled some boats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned the others and stood by to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure they were caught good. Then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut the moorings o' some and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted into dry reeds by the bank lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. You'd ha' thought all Egypt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning. It stopped 'em, I reckon. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back down-stream as fast as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make it, and our boats were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, with the watch awake. From that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit o' high ground where you and I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLEOPATRA'S PROMISE</seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg><seg type="columnLine">conning, I could see 'em in full moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. They've met that column that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw marching southward, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">they've all dropped anchor. Wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">what next, I reckon. My boat's crew are</seg><seg type="columnLine">used up, master; I've dismissed 'em."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You may lie on my cloak and get</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sleep yourself," Tros answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have done well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conops saluted and backed away, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most into the fire. He grinned all around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thought I smelt herring! Well, I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelt worse!

How's Odin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tros interrupted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Manners, you wharf-rat!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conops came and faced Arsinoe. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened his face, straightened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife at his belt, put his hands to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, his heels together, and bowed low.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your obedient servant.

"Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">my cloak and turn in!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, aye, master."</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg><seg type="columnLine">"tros! tros!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">TROS' genius, like that of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">true cruiser captains, was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lied to the cavalry type. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitually thought in terms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift maneuver, ruse, economy of men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sudden impact. But he had no cav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alry. And in fighting on land he lacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience. He knew it, but he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man to share that kind of secret,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor to let his men even suspect it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even Arsinoe, who watched him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a kind of cat-wise alertness, wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his apparent self-assurance. She knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as he, how desperate the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was, but she had yet to learn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first article of Tros' faith: that luck is</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the side of him who knows luck when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sees it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Luck began to arrive, a full hour be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore dawn. Scores of the peasant-labor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, who had fled southward from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning barracks, served as well as any</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen of scouting cavalry. They gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample warning of the enemy's advance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming phantoming back, to avoid being</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught and made to carry ammunition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and other heavy burdens. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew where the supplies of ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">millet, onions, radishes and oil were hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den in plundered tombs. So they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounced on and looted in turn; every</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in Tros' command had had a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal before sunrise, chopping up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate for fuel and building their little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires behind the wall, out of sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tros made his depositions long be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore daylight. He could not afford to</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupy a wide front, against what would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be overwhelming numbers, unless his</seg><seg type="columnLine">force was concentrated and kept well in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. His scouts reported six war-chari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ots; those would probably be manned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">archers, and used for out-flanking pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He chose his battle-front with chari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ots in mind, taking Sigurdsen, Conops</seg><seg type="columnLine">and five decurions to point out to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly the positions they should take</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and they marked their stations to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid confusion. He let his men lie at</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease behind the wall, avoiding the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roman commanders' mistake of upset-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting nerves by getting tired men too</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon into the battle-line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arsinoe came with him. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">denying her. She was silent, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be studying Tros and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">depositions as if destiny depended, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">on what he would do, but on under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing how and why he did it. A long</seg><seg type="columnLine">thighed, actively striding girl, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her armor like a lad of eighteen. Sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urdsen paid her a good deal of attention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He told her her hair was like a Norse</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's, and that it was a pity she should</seg><seg type="columnLine">die so young and lovely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For here we die. But we will hew</seg><seg type="columnLine">our swath first! And perhaps they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take you prisoner."</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Satisfied with his own assigned posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, Sigurdsen took little interest in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of Tros' arrangements, although he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave advice when asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The left wing was to rest on the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall with the gate fifty yards to its rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">--seamen under the command of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">decurions, Pertinax and Thestius.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The right wing under Conops, consist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the ten Jews and thirty seamen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to rest against a honeycomb of open</seg><seg type="columnLine">tombs that would make them very diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult indeed to outflank. Sigurdsen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his battle-axemen were to hold the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, facing nearly due South.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tros himself, with three decurions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty men, would take position with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their backs to the well, in reserve, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reenforce any part of the line that</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like breaking. Between the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter and the wings, on either side, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured laborers were put to digging</seg><seg type="columnLine">short trenches, in which the archers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep cover and be frugal with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">perilously scanty ammunition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Facing south by southwest, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyramids on their left hand, they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have the sun in their eyes, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy would have, should they attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a turning movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last Arsinoe broke silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I, Lord Captain? Where is my</seg><seg type="columnLine">place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your men will be distributed to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">under my decurions. I have ordered it</seg><seg type="columnLine">so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She answered him very calmly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without heroics, but she held her chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is this not my battle? Is it yours</seg><seg type="columnLine">only? Do you think, because I am a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, and a Ptolemy, I am unfit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead my own men? They are my men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will obey me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Then command me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was true, he had ignored her. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have told her to hide in a tomb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he knew he would have to assign</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable men to keep her from coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will stand by me with the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She saluted. He returned into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure and talked to the men, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaining to them what they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">called upon to do, wasting no breath on</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You men know me, and I know you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said finally. "Let us remember we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud to be comrades in arms!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no mistaking their answer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the growling roar of men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do their ungrudging utmost. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, he led his archers to the trenches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave each man careful instruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Daybreak revealed the enemy less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than half a mile distant, but Tros' posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion would remain for a long while yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in shadow. The intervening sand was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominously strewn with mummies that</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembled blackened corpses on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken battle-field. Evidently Conops</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only seen about half of the men at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temple up-river; the combined forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the enemy, in dense formation, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like five or six hundred men. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were probably non-combatants;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there seemed, too, to be armed men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reserve, in the shadow around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a quite small pyramid. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were six two-horsed chariots out in front,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in line, and in one of them stood a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, not in armor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had two fan-bearers up behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Fans such as those were the royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">insignia. Her chariot was surrounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen footmen in splendid armor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scouting ahead was a line of about thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, advancing timidly, expecting to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">met by arrow-fire from ambush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boidion!" Arsinoe laughed. "Boidion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you poor fool!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not Boidion's chariot, but another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came trotting forward alone. The inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was obvious. From behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen of scouts its occupant proposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">harangue Tros' men, to offer terms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps to offer a price for Tros him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, dead or alive. But there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of Tros' actual position until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLEOPATRA'S PROMISE</seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg><seg type="columnLine">chariot approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">too near to the hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly dug trench-</seg><seg type="columnLine">es.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then a bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cretan archer</seg><seg type="columnLine">twanged.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">could no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">afford to try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">starve Tros out</seg><seg type="columnLine">than could he af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford to refuse bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle.

What</seg><seg type="columnLine">Memphis did know</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen held hostage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would be ruth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less.

There arose a roar from the enemy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranks, and the advance commenced, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely space enough between the serried</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">companies to cushion the inevitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure of the wings on the center as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they charged a narrower front than their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tros, up on the well-coping with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the wooden gallows-post,</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned for his trireme's arrow-engines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were a motley host that came</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him--men of all races, armed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. There were Greeks in light</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoplite armor; archers in bronze and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather; pikemen in heavy armor, hel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meted like Roman gladiators; coal-black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nubians in lion-skin with ox-hide shields</seg><seg type="columnLine">and iron-bladed stabbing spears that</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced in the sun to the time of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundering song.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the center marched a heavy pha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanx. eighty strong, of men who looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Thracians. A scattering of Roman</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniforms; some turbaned Parthians;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arabs; but no native Egyptians, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wretched peasantry, who lugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy arrow-baskets in the rear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thundering ranks. Ninety per cent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officers were kilted Greeks, out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of their men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a force that should have wilted</seg><seg type="columnLine">away under the fire of well-drilled arch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers; and Tros' archers were experts; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had had to order them to hold fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they could make every last arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">count at close range. Men had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">told off to gather the enemy's arrows to</seg><seg type="columnLine">replenish the few dozen that each archer</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stuck in the sand in the trench be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sigurdsen's men crouched in the arch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers' trenches, leaving a tempting gap for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the advancing phalanx. It came on at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the double--a slow, heavy-pounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">jog-trot, to break Tros' line at the gap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tros' archers, at less than fifty yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">range, sent a sudden, screaming hail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows into the light infantry on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">flank of the phalanx, checking, for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment halting them in confusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The phalanx came on alone, led by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Macedonian protected by two swords-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. All three fell to Sigurdsen's axe--</seg><seg type="columnLine">three swipes that split them down be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they could think how to engage the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfamiliar weapon. Those were the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">three to be slain in close combat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sigurdsen went berserk. Heaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer's corpse left-handed, he hurled it</seg><seg type="columnLine">against three spearmen, leaped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gap and battle-axed a swath for his men</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow through. They went in wedge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise. Long spears, once their front was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken, were as useless against axes as</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many ornamental awning-poles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were worse than useless. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging axes shored through bronze ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mor, or beat men to earth by the sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of the blow. The recovering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">back-handed up-swing was equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly, cleaving arm-pits, laying bellies</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, splitting unguarded chins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The phalanx went down, and was not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three wounded Northmen rolled into an</seg><seg type="columnLine">archer's trench, and Sigurdsen went for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, he and his men roaring their bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle-cry:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tros!

Five chariots and at least a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred men had been detached to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a westward circuit, away around</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the right wing, with the obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention to attack from the rear. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take them more than an hour to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make that march over wind-rippled sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">--perhaps longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same time their right wing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being heavily reinforced by men march-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in column, in an effort to drive a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wedge between Tros and the wall. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to have the wall. Tros saw fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let them have it. They had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line toward the boats wide open; all their</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserves had been detached for that en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tros sent a man to command Arsinoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come away from the left wing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">meanwhile reorganized his center, lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent another man for Conops, who ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived breathless. Conops went down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees and carefully cut through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft of the arrow that had pierced Tros'</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg, leaving about two inches of the shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">protruding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand by for a hot one, master!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He struck the protruding shaft one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard blow with the hilt of his heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife, then seized the arrow-point with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his teeth and pulled it through. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiped the blood off his face and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly for a dead or wounded man</seg><seg type="columnLine">from whom to strip some sort of band-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arsinoe had come. Tros was swear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at her. She had on a gossamer linen</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress beneath her chain mail. Conops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quick as lightning, knifed off yards of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thin material, and she laughed as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound it around Tros' leg, artfully plac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a pad to stop the bleeding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What now, master?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tros used terse sea-phrases to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">a land maneuver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "East-south-east in line ahead until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">change helm!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, aye!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conops returned to the right wing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within a minute there began one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those brilliant maneuvers that, if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeed, are reckoned proof of mili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary genius, but, if they fail, are de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced as rash, unmartial errors of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool. An impossible maneuver without</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid discipline. It almost failed, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause Sigurdsen hated to yield ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tros threw his whole line into column,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conops leading, and himself in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand of the rear that had been his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing. He outflanked the enemy's left!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The very suddenness of the maneu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver threw the enemy into confusion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They found themselves, some with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">flank against the wall, some with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs to the wall, some of them holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line that Tros had held, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">left wing reeling, routed, as the astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing column changed front. Their bag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gage-guard bolted; there was not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage; it was principally arrows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the amazing column changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">front--a mere eighty battle-weary men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conops' golden trumpet sounded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge and Tros led them, limping. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were into the enemy's rear before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what to expect. Their commander</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shot down. They milled, broke, tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to retreat through the gap in the walled</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosure, throwing all the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force into hopeless confusion, into which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tros' archers poured a devastating hail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of captured arrows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The one chariot that had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent with the reserves on that fatal en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling movement tried to escape in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the Nile.

"Drifter"</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarden ducked the broad brim of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlsbad sombrero against the slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">slant of it as he rode.

They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hungry--yet. The cattle could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that such little coves on Old Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pryor's ranch were now but scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots on a wide, black wasteland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drifter McLarden knew it--surmised</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, at least, from what he saw as he ioped</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranchward from the beef delivery he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made at the stockyards. He knew it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a tough winter ahead. Short</seg><seg type="columnLine">feed, extra riding, bucking blizzardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">snowdrifts to scatter scanty hay; cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and freezing hands as you nursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">"hospital stock" into the sheds and cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rals; the dirty work of skinning, for Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man Pryor always saved the dollar or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two to be got from a die-up hide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">All this McLarden knew--and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't give a damn.

There would be cards</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Drifter's deft fingers, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarding house, with woman-folks' cook-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; girls, maybe. Let the card tables</seg><seg type="columnLine">contribute their unfailing bit to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stake of his summer wages, and McLar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den would winter well and cozily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only damn fools stayed north here</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you watered your horse each</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning through broken ice.

But Old Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pryor himself went further. He hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchy Doucette like a tall, proud</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolfhound hates the mange.

"I am here, vous voyez, to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the offer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Man Pryor looked briefly at Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larden as he came in.

The look of stiff, steely cold polite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness vanished suddenly from old Pryor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Swift color reddened the brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his lean, leathery face as temper</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped its leash. He stood up, a ramrod</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his spine. Ilis doubled fist struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk beside him with angry warlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">drumming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neighbors, eh?" he stormed. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want to rent me grass?

The cold steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">blueness came back to his eyes. His long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand reached into a drawer of the desk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought out a .45 from whose barrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the blue was leather-worn. Calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dropped it into the open holster at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thigh. He brought his hands together in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front, like a parson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doucette," he said, "go for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frenchy shrugged, grimaced. His right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand pushed back the too-long flap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his faded blue jumper. Like all of Fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cois Doucette's movements, the motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quick, nervous. Smooth as the flap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hawkwing Ed Pryor's right hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung down, backward; and swifter yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward again and up, the worn gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt firm in the grip of his palm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a swifter hand than his clamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a claw upon his wrist. Its nails bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, as the mate to that hand wrenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the .45 free from his fingers. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crash and clatter of broken glass as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy sixgun hurtled through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window into the snow-sifty air and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumpily to the frozen ground. Drifter</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarden stood calmly between the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, his back to old Frenchy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You better set down, Ed," he advised</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently.

Drifter</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarden's wide, easy mouth no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled, but his voice still came evenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost casually, past the cigarette that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung from a lip corner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better take a dally on yourself, Ed,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he commented quietly.

Except for the gawky frame of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tugwire Harrison sprawled on a rawhide</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocker by the stove, whittling, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cozy shack was empty.

McLarden grinned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved the bills in his pocket. "See you</seg><seg type="columnLine">at breakfast, Ed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man scowled, started to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, changed his mind about it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What ails him?" snorted Tugwire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Didn't hardly eat no supper, an'--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doucette," said McLarden, "paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a call this evenin'. Maybe it kinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his appetite."</seg><seg type="columnLine">AN HOUR after first dawn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, Drifter McLarden was</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding southward, leading a</seg><seg type="columnLine">packhorse bearing his hot-roll</seg><seg type="columnLine">and war-bag. The snow had stopped. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind came now, sharp and cold, out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northeast. The earth lay under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grainy, six inch blanket, wind-rippled on</seg><seg type="columnLine">top and drifted here and there, dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">white under a clear but dingy sky. Off</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward the still invisible sun reddened</seg><seg type="columnLine">dully the great black bank of cloud that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulked along the horizon. Last night's</seg><seg type="columnLine">skiff of snow had been but a sample.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sure enough weather was making yonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the northeast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarden angled his face away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sharp cross-bite of the wind. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">left foot, on the windward side, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomped a little in the stirrup to warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">the toes. He had never owned a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">SUMMER HAND</seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg><seg type="columnLine">overshoes. And why should he? Today</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would noon in a sheltered cove well</seg><seg type="columnLine">down below the wintry rim of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">high mesas. Tomorrow lie would be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Valley, following the Rio down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, ever southward until 110 longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">would the fangs of the norther snap at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maybe the next day he would begin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see blackbirds again. It was a pleasant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmish sound they made, blackbirds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kinder made him think of the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices of the two pretty coyotas, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-French, half-Mexican girls who</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited table at Mom Dawson's board-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing house in Cruces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He worked the chill-stiffened fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his buckskin gloves. They were slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. It seemed to him that already</seg><seg type="columnLine">they riffled the cards in the pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth of Monte Smith wick's snug</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Unconsciously McLarden added a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little pressure to the spurs. Southward!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the south Sacaton gate he had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd his horse through a jam of cattle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm drifted, lodged there in the corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">against stout fencing. They were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor cattle, these fifty-odd head, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were bawling already from empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomachs. Their trampling had pounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow from a wide circle north of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fence. The revealed ground was sooty</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, grassless. McLarden was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much cowboy not to notice how sunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">their flanks were--already. It doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">take long for even a fat cow to starve,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarden shoved through to the gate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and got down to open it. His chilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers fumbled the lever stick, clumsily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosened the catch loop, started to swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate open. But instead he jerked it</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut again, fastened it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell!" he grunted, and tied his pack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse to the fence. "I can spare an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reckon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped up to the saddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hee-yi-ee! Hoop-yoo! Move out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cattle had no mind to go in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the sharpening wind, lanced as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was with whirls of picked-up snow. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">took McLarden a good two hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady, monotonous shoving to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">them back north to a rough, rock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rimmed cove where he had noticed, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing, bunch grass sticking up a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the snow--an acre or so the fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">had missed. And then it was of little</seg><seg type="columnLine">use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another bunch of cattle--maybe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred head--were already in the cove.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had its scattered bunch grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumps about cleaned up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarden felt the chill of cooling</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat go over his body. He growled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a few choice phrases of profanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hee-yi--ee! Hoop-yoo! Move out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angrily he spurred his horse into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treachery of snow-masked rocks to head</seg><seg type="columnLine">this bunch off eastward. There ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a couple more such rock-rimmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">coves a mile or two para alia that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire had probably missed. McLarden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse caught a shod hoof in a jam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jagged edged rocks. The spurs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodding him. He went down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other knee, yanked himself free and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. But now he limped a little and blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">trickled down his leg to blotch red on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whiteness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snow started to whip down again</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, out of the northeast. It was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarden could do to keep the uneasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle angling across the edgy slant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time he reached the Rock Rim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coves his horse was limping badly. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">own toes were tingling with cold. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm came slicing down like a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel knife. Of the four coves he counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, only one had escaped the fire, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of it came a drift of cattle. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yonder, two hundred yards away, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">the zigzag of Elbow Creek. Cutting its</seg><seg type="columnLine">curves so that the Creek was first on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and then the other, stretched a stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of sturdy, six-wire fence, unneigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">borly but efficient barrier between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pryor and Doucette ranges. Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larden circled the cattle and rode to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">knoll just short of the Creek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even through the slanting snow he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that the flats beyond were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead white as they were here. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were spotted thick with brownish blobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bunch-grass. Jn places even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gramma showed up through the snow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarden knew these flats; part of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doucette's "reserve," which, thanks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">good seasons, he had not grazed at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">for two or three years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Often enough McLarden had joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pryor cowboys in contemptuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment on a cattleman so cautious</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would waste good grazing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, year after year, saving it against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of need that like as not would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took some time to get a span of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sturdy fence down, without tools,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flattened so that cattle would cross it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the time he had it ready there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a cow in sight. McLarden overtook</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, drifting in straggling strings be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the storm, half a mile back south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hee-yi--ee! Hoop--ee-yah!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Savagely he slashed the doubled rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">end across the snouts of the leaders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting them back. Sullenly, snail-like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they turned. In a scattering motte of</seg><seg type="columnLine">charred scrub juniper he left them. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way back to his pack-horse at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sacaton gate he walked and rode by</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns. His bay was limping b:i&lt;lly now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The walking warmed his feet, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated it, none the less. The well-booted</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of horseback men grow tender after</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of little walking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarden reckoned it well past noon</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he reached his pack-horse, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail to the wind, shivering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tough, ain't it, Bugsy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The horse nickered anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarden found a lone juniper be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side some boulders that offered a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter from the steady drive of wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and snow. There he dumped his pack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shifted the saddle to Bugsy, rig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging a bedroll blanket on the sweaty bay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured him a scanty feed of oats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left him staked there to the juniper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had to use the spurs freely to force</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bugsby back northeastward again in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of the storm. But Drifter Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larden was stubborn. Headin' south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, yeah--but he aimed to see them</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry cows 011 grass first. Old Douc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ette had grass to rent, didn't he? Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, damn him, now he had it rented,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if he didn't know it. Damn little</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry cattle knew or cared about grass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent terms or neighborly enmity. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">they wanted was grass. Let the Old Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Frenchy Doucette come to terms as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might see fit, later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The seventy-odd head of Pryor cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking hungrily to Frenchy Doucette's</seg><seg type="columnLine">old grass didn't pause to thank the tired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rawfaced, sweat-chilled cowboy who</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused to roll a smoke as the last strag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gler came out east of Elbow Creek. Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larden's chilled fingers shook, spilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of the tobacco. But his face wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim, cold-stiffened smile as he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again across the down fence. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the spurs to Bugsy. The thickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">grayness told him that night was not far</seg><seg type="columnLine">off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hundred yards away he reined up</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, listening. Down the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">came shouting, the whooping of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to drive cattle. His ears caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">its Spanish flavor. Frenchy Doucette's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboys were always Mexicans, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably because they worked for less,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept a full crew on, even through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wearily Drifter McLarden reined</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bugsy around. A rough, rebellious trot</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the best he could get out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse against that slanting whip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The five shouting, cursing vaqueros</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not making much headway prying</seg><seg type="columnLine">those cattle loose from old Frenchv's</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass. They had perhaps a dozen al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready choused back across the Creek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarden was in the midst of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they saw him in the growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oigan, compadres!" the cowboy</seg><seg type="columnLine">SUMMER HAND</seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg><seg type="columnLine">called out in drawling Spanish. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think you're doing here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if at a signal the five left off chous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cattle and circled him, waving their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree hands excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Threateningly, they wanted to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">who the hell turned these Pryor cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto their boss's grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did," said Drifter McLarden. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw that they were all tricked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their "go-yonder" clothes. Heading</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the ranch from a fiesta session</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their placita, evidently, they had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened upon these cattle. Probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were still a little drunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You, eh? By God, hombre--" began</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chunky one, called Paco Sisneros.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wup, here!" McLarden's voice cut in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply. "Hold it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The cowboy's gun stood out in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. The right hand of Paco Sisneros</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped dead half an inch from the butt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his Colt. McLarden backed his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly out of the circle of them so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might have his back to none.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen here! I got no quarrel with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you boys. You better leave this business</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to your boss. He's goin' to rent this</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass to Pryor, you sabe?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I theenk you lie," said one called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toribio, sneeringly. "Maybe you come</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeth us an' talk to the boss you'self,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Damn me, I will!" growled Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larden. "But you boys git on home</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, an' let these cattle be. You hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They looked at his gun and heard him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">McLarden watched them go. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh he holstered his gun and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">again southwestward. He wondered as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rode if his finger had actually been</seg><seg type="columnLine">too numb to pull the trigger if and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it might have needed to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">DRIFTER McLARDEN had</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned to spend this night in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snug comfort of a Mexi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can adobe village well down</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Valley. He spent it, instead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lee of tarp and boulder, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, nursing green juniper branches in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to smoky fire lest the snow-laden zero</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind chill through to his bones. The cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">biscuits and meat he had brought for</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday's nooning served him now for</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper and breakfast as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At dawn the sky was clear again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching blue with the cold. He saddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bugsy, packed the lame bay. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled slowly, plodding a full two feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of snow, again northeastward. Five or six</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles it would be to Frenchy Doucette's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun rose dazzling bright, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">little warmth. These uplands lay glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering in the white grasp of implacable</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold. He crossed Elbow Creek, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday he had driven the cattle, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid ice. The cattle were still there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered about, backs humped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">icicled with the snow their body warmth</seg><seg type="columnLine">had melted. But their flanks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded, now, from well-filled paunches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even yet some bunch grass tops</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed up through the snow. On such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a range they could always make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to eat. As quick as he could see old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchy and make some deal with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of Pryor's herds could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved across here too, and fare as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw Frenchy sooner than he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected. Half a mile from Elbow Creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">he met him, with four of his vaqueros,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming to shove the Pryor cattle from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarden wasted no words: on what</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms would Doucette rent winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">range for Ed Pryor's cattle?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So the calf comes to the milk after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, eh?" said Frenchy Doucette. "Day</seg><seg type="columnLine">before yesterday I have range to rent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my neighbor. He gives me slap in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Only for you, he have killed me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, if I have all the grass in hell, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle of Ed Pryor--let 'em starve!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vamos, hombres!" shouted Paco</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sisneros. "We go to drive them out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a swift movement McLarden</seg><seg type="columnLine">squared his horse crosswise in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Reckless of the odds, his grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile met them steadily above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocked .45 in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute, Doucette," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's be reasonable about this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Matalo! Kill heem!" shouted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man called Toribio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarden saw five swift vaquero</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands reach for their guns. The cornered</seg><seg type="columnLine">coyote may slash down the first dog to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap at him, but a pack of five or six</seg><seg type="columnLine">will get him in the end. Well, if it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be so, so be it. But it might yet be</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluff. If not, Paco would be the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog down. He saw Doucette's frost-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rimmed whiskers quivering, his small</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes bugging out. There was a gun at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thigh today, but his hand had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paco Sisneros brandished his gun in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, and came charging toward him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still McLarden waited. He had no de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire to kill if he could help it. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly he realized he had waited too</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. It was another of the vaqueros,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toribio, who was ready to shoot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarden changed his aim. His finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightened on the trigger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, like the rush of a tiger, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse of Frenchy Doucette leaped for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. His rump struck Bugsy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, as Frenchy swung him around</seg><seg type="columnLine">to collide shoulder against shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the mount of Paco Sisneros.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two shots roared out, almost at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarden knew his own had missed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as for Toribio's--the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchy Doucette's horse had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">into line between McLarden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vaquero's gun at the exact instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of firing. The horse went down like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">axed steer. Even as he fell, Frenchy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doucette slipped from the saddle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, gun in hand, spitting out curses</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mixed Spanish, French and English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his humped little back was turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Drifter McLarden, his face and gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">snout to Paco and the other vaqueros.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! Bon dieu, no, Paco!" he rasped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stop eet! No tiren inas, cochons!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whatever Ed Pryor, his cowboys and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world in general might think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchy Doucette, his own men obeyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him now as they would have obeyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warning rattle of a diamond-back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As one man they holstered their guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the face of his. A little shamed, now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarden followed suit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Meestaire McLardaine," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little old man gravely, "I do not forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">that two days ago you save me the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I have no gun. Alors, is eet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Old Man Pryore send you here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, to put his cows on my grass?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," McLarden spoke frankly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't give a damn whose they are.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchy, hungry cows have got to eat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's why I'm here--why them cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">is on your grass--and why they're goin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay there! You said yourself you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the grass to spare."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frenchy Doucette shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The cattle of Ed Pryore," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"to hell weeth them! But you--your</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose is blue weeth the cold--at my house</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coffee pot is always hot. Bien, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">come weeth me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to McLarden that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not remember when he had last tasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot coffee. But he shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neverthless, when Frenchy finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered his men to let the cattle alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">for today, McLarden went with them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guest or prisoner? He did not know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They rode in silence, Doucette and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his men mounted double. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the old man's saddle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaqueros eyed McLarden sullenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the first cup of hot, steaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee warming his "innards" Drifter</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarden realized that now he had tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own hands. When a man saved your</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and you accepted his hospitality</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus, you couldn't turn right around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fight him. To hell with hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle! His trail lay southward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thees beeg grass fire," Frenchy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying, "because eet was trouble be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween us one long damn time ago about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheep that I had when I come first</seg><seg type="columnLine">to thees place, my neighbor and me are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not friends. He hate me. Maybe I hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">heem, too. So he theenk I make thees</seg><seg type="columnLine">SUMMER HAND</seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, in order that I can sell heem the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass, or maybe buy heem the cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheap. But it ees not true!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man's earnestness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">comical, but it was convincing, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckon ol' Ed knows it ain't," Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larden said. "He was mad, Frenchy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mad! All the time he ees mad, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one! But I don't like that he say thees</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of me!

But I am not hard in the heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mira, Meeslaire McLardaine, you go</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell the 01' Man Pryore thees: if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">come here to me and say: 'Doucette, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a lie that I speak when 1 accuse you</seg><seg type="columnLine">thees fire.' Then, by gar, the grass I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to spare, I will not sell heem it! No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the saints, but for the cows I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">first he must come, thees orguUoso, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admeet he lie! I lend you a fresh horse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You go, McLardaine, now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell," said the cowboy, "if that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way the land lays, I might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">head south again. I'm wastin' my time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      NEVERTHELESS, mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one of Doucette's ratty</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponies, McLarden went. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung southward to cross El-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow Creek where he had let the fence</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. He did not know that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he came in sight of the Bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grass Flats, he reined up suddenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three riders were jamming the cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">back across the Creek westward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarden rammed in the spurs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came on as fast as the pony could wal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low and lunge through the snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of the three riders turned when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw him. They reined up, waiting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on their guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tugwire Harrison, muffled up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gills, took the hand from his gun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let his tobacco-juicy jaw sag in sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. Old Man Ed Pryor stiffened in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle. His face was drawn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue with the cold. His gaze moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the ratty Doucette pony, then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of its rider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, McLarden," he said, "ridin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the scrubs, eh? This your work?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He waved his hand toward the cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">recrossing the down fence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The blood rushed angrily to Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larden's face. He had meant to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Old Man diplomatically, but now--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're damn right it is!" he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You damned old fool, you want your</seg><seg type="columnLine">cows to starve?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll git feed for 'em," said Ed Pryor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The word seemed to strike the Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man square in the face, like a well</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven fist. McLarden could see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it staggered him. Whatever front he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might put up, the Old Man must know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as he, that there was no range</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be had; and as for hay and cake--Ed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pryor could never finance enough of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that to feed straight through a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard winter. The cattle were hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">already, this first storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For once Old Man Pryor's eyes failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold their own. They wavered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked away, squinting in the glare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In hell!" he said, and whirled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse around. He seemed unaware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarden was riding up beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ed," said McLarden, "old Frenchy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sends vou word that--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To hell with him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A big steer, knowing now where grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">was and reluctant to leave it, cut back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the others and came charging back</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ice of Elbow Creek. The Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man spurred savagely out to head him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the quick icy turn the steer got past</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. As he swerved to follow. Drifter</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarden suddenly blocked his path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hold on a minute, Ed," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "I want to talk to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For once Old Man Pryor "held on."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drifter McLarden's gun was in his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was a queer, hard look in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Pryor stared at him unbelieving-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, but he stopped, just the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Ed," McLarden said with sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">soberness, "I'm done with monkey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">business. 01' Frenchy's actin' white</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this. lie paid you a call the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other day. You're coinin' with me now</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to return it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A queer gleam, almost of amusement</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet with something of approval in it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, came into the old cowman's eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ain't never budged under gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat yet, Drifter," he said. "An' I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">too old to start it now. You can put it</seg><seg type="columnLine">up--or shoot, as you like!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his own hand made no move</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the six-gun at his thigh. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">full minute they sat thus, deadlocked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tautness of McLarden's anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagged. He was remembering the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">summers he had ridden for this salty old</seg><seg type="columnLine">rannyhan before him--four good sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons of loyalty between them. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Old Man's stubborn temper, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known still more of his kindness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his frank, fair-dealing with his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Off yonder he could hear cattle--the Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man's cattle--bawling as Tugwire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other cowboy drove the m--</seg><seg type="columnLine">where? To starvation? Yet how many</seg><seg type="columnLine">starving cows would it take to be worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stubborn old man's blood?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drifter McLarden holstered his gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To hell with it!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He whirled his horse around. But not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way he had come. Cattle, Doucette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Ed, his pack, his horse--let them all</seg><seg type="columnLine">be damned! Drifter McLarden, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, was heading south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was suddenly aware of Old Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pryor's horse along side of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ed Pryor's voice was gruff as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I reckon you meant right, Drifter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No hard feelin's?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None," said the cowboy shortly. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ignored the hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HE tried to shut out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional doleful music of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bawling of hungry, wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering cattle by thinking how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fluting of blackbirds would sound in</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a few days now, down in the Valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wondered how it would seem to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm feet again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a thuddy rattle of shots, dulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the earth's great muffler of snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">that jarred him suddenly back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reality of this eold-bitten range. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from somewhere back 011 Elbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek. McLarden whirled the ratty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doucette pony around. Ratty or not, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a tough piece of horseflesh. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back-track he traveled. The sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional bursts of shooting kept Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larden's spurs to the pony's ribs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had left Doucette's that</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, McLarden did not know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been followed, at a safe dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, by five of Doucette's Mexicans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smarting at the recollection of yester-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's run-in with this gringo whom their</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss's intervention had saved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarden had ridden faster than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they thought. They came to the bunch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass flats after he had gone. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were out for trouble. They had spied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Man Pryor and Tugwire Harrison</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the steer that had broken back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Doucette range, and opened fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drifter McLarden crossed Elbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creek cautiously, paused, listened. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitened flats, nobbed here and yonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rocky upthrusts, lay silent. Nor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the depression of the creek, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">he see the lone rider coming at a strain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lope from the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarden rode out into the open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From behind one of the rocky up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrusts five hundred yards away burst a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clatter of rifle-fire. Bullets sputted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow a few rods before him. From be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind another hump farther out beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded the pow-pow of six-guns, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shout of warning in the shrill voice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Tugwire Harrison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swerving away from the rifle fire a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, McLarden put the pony to a lope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So it had come, now, to bullets!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, from the first rocky-point</seg><seg type="columnLine">"fort" burst forth two horsemen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartering to head him off. McLarden</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw rifles gleam in their hands. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">SUMMER HAND</seg><seg type="columnLine">77</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried none himself, only the .45. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerved off a little more, but he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not turn back. One of the vaqueros</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, swung down, fired from on foot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bullets struck closer, yet still fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">short. Old style, lead slug .44's, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">range was not long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then all at once McLarden ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerve away. From behind the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky point appeared a man on foot, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall man, lunging toward the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaqueros through the snow, his six-gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring as he came. It took no second</seg><seg type="columnLine">look to see who it was: Old Man Pryor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing out to draw their fire away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grimly McLarden put tie spurs to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony, heading him straight toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two vaqueros with rifles. He knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range was too great, but now he fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">once--twice, anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt his pony lunge suddenly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop struggling into the snow. He freed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet from the stirrups and plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead. The rifles cracked again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the Old Man lunge head first into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow. Snow spurted up around</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had fallen. Old Tugwire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mayfield were rushing out now, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarden yelled to them to keep back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rifles against six-guns--it could be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">use. A bullet whopped through the wing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his chaps. Another--his right leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt queer and numb. But he could still</seg><seg type="columnLine">plow ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out yonder in the snow the Old Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed again, coming to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down!" McLarden yelled. "Damn it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed, keep down!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the vaqueros was taking de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberate aim now, at McLarden. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboy turned, dived suddenly as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he could sidewise into the snow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot missed but the vaquero was ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">as McLarden came up again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, somewhere to the left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward, there rose a shout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop eet! Non! Non! Stop eet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not the shout, however, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">the booming pow of old Ed Pryor's six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun that spoiled Toribio's next deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately aimed shot. It was a bullet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old .44 carbine of old Frenchy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doucette. Toribio's rifle leaped skyward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He spun around and sank into the snow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juan swung to his horse again, and used</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spurs. Toribio got up, tried to run--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, in spite of himself. Drifter</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarden was down in the snow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not get up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Frenchy Doucette got to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, but Old Man Pryor was not far</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. H i s face showed haggard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more with anxiety than pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Drifter!" he croaked. "They--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">git you, son?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jest whacked my leg a little I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckon.

"I seen you down one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own men to save him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Drifter McLarden was not too bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt to perceive that old Ed's hand did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not go ungripped.

Tom resolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to let his father's ruin go unpun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within a few weeks Tom's brig, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iris, cleared for the Mona Passage, called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Devil's Graveyard because of French</seg><seg type="columnLine">depredations. She was small, but Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fitted her with a long twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound gun, rifled and on gimbals, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a range of a mile. He bore American</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters of marque and the pick of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting crew, eager for a taste of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish Main and booty. To disguise</seg><seg type="columnLine">his intent, and embroil Porton with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">French, Tom renamed his boat the Scor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pion and masqueraded as the pirate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They sighted a French brig homeward</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound from Jacmel, and Swayne, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guise of Porton, made her haul down</seg><seg type="columnLine">her colors. The booty, six casks of Hai-</seg><seg type="columnLine">78</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SCGRPION</seg><seg type="columnLine">79</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian gold, was welcome, but the informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion Swayne obtained was even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. For Mademoiselle Le Gai--one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his prisoners--was a fiancee of the Jac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mel official-mentioned in Porton's letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the man to whom his father's ransom</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be paid. Swayne decided to slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the French ships guarding the har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bor, release the girl, and endeavor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn his father's fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jacmel, ravaged by insurrection, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily fortified, but under cover of</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, Swayne landed a boat and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stored the girl to her fiance. The latter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelmed with gratitude, told Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Porton's ship lay at anchor to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west of the harbor, and that Porton him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self had landed that day to confer with</seg><seg type="columnLine">de Berrien, the military governor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mademoiselle Le Gai, intensely grateful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered to have Tom conveyed safely to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sea will always wait," Tom said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Take me by the most secluded path</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the governor's house!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His men, crouching close to the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentries, with the gallows a certainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">if discovered, eyed him aghast, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed him down the darkened avenue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">BETWEEN TWO FIRES</seg><seg type="columnLine">HERE! There, M'sieur, is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house of the general."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etion stopped in the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointed through a maze of ceiba and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mango trees to a dark mass of a house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a comer of which a light burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keeping well to the shaded line of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk, Tom moved up the drive. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted when his quick ears caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffle of shod feet and the unmistak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able clank of a musket. Then a sentry</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed against the light of the hall; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see his headgear silhouetted against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the candles. The room at the corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house was brightly lighted and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the figure of a man leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a desk littered with papers. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Etion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Take a good look, Etion," he whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered. "Is that the military governor?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etion nodded. Tom drew him further</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the shadows and motioned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men to close up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Etion," he said gruffly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we're Americans, at war with France.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're a Negro and a servant to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">French lady. Where do you stand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this? Are you for us or against us?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etion looked at him and his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted in a grimace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Cap'n," he said, "I help Etion</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Grand.

His men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been listening wide-eyed, closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a little. "How can we get rid of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentry?" muttered Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etion came to life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know dis place," he said.

You watch."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He slunk back into the shadows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they waited. A moment later Tom saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow drifting from bush to bush, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">merged with the trunk of a great ceiba</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sentry moved along his beat, hum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming a little song. With Jacmel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">French hands and a heavy force of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">80</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantry in the redoubts he knew that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">was safe. He paced to the end of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat, turned. While he still hung on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels, a shadow leaped from the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Tom saw what looked like long</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacles of blackness wrap about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentry's neck as Etion's skinny arms, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong as steel, choked the man into</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconsciousness. He dropped like a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and Etion seemed to swarm all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him. The next minute Black sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help him; between them they man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to tie the man with his own gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sling and to gag him with his shirt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They laid him in an inert mass under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bush and came back to Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Black, you come with me. You oth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers stay here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITHIN the house, the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">still bent over his papers. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner door of the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung quietly open the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up to see two white men--and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol-muzzle not five feet from his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> General Alphonse de Berrien, Mili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary Governor of Haiti, leaped to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet with a choking cry that passed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a throaty gurgle as Tom spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand still . . ." His pistol hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke a language that needed 110 trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation. With bulging eyes the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose silently, his eyes fastened on Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a bird eyes a snake. Tom motioned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etion at his heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ask him if he speaks English," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etion jabbered excitedly and turned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" 'E say a leetle, suh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell him I am the captain of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American privateer Scorpion and he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">my prisoner.

Well, it just happens that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's the man I want. Bring him along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black; hang on to him no matter what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens. Come on. Let's get back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a pistol muzzle in the small of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back. General de Berrien moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly. The other men joined them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stair-foot and they crept along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark street. From time to time the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a tavern opened and laughter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">singing drifted out to them. Once a shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the party pause; then an outburst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of musketry from a distant redoubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed like thunder. As they passed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">open door their prisoner struggled vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently, as though he knew this was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">last chance of escape, but Black tripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and Tom dragged him to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Down this street, I think," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The beach can't be far."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SCORPION</seg><seg type="columnLine">81</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All streets led to the beach that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a common street for all Jacmel. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no permanent guard on that beach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor any need for one. Soldiers held each</seg><seg type="columnLine">end and the escaped slaves had no boats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In any case, a party small enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">land undetected would be too small to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause much damage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baker turned into a broad path that</seg><seg type="columnLine">led past an inn and was hurrying along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark road when the unexpected hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. The tavern door flung suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">open and the streaming lamp-light out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined the Americans and the figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">General de Berrien, his hands tied, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">harried along by the raiders. At that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, the prisoner, who had managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to free his jaws of the gag, raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice in a shrill cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A moi!" he shouted. "A moi, mes</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldats!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a brief second silence gripped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd inside the tavern. Then two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">surged into the street. A sharp oath</seg><seg type="columnLine">was followed by a rush of stamping feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by the ring of steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the boat, men!" Tom's voice rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">out above the noises of the crowd. "Run</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and keep the man. Hold him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They broke into a run. Tom seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoner and hurled him forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He struggled in vain against Black and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baker as they hustled him to the beach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the sea-flattened sands gave firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">footing. The boat on the shingle showed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long black blot against the water. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden hail came to them as the boat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard came to life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who in hell is that?" demanded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. That was Gwynn's reckless shout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shove off into deep water an' stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">by"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The bow-man promptly shoved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat off the beach and the oars thumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the thole-pins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Port-oar give way! There! Way</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough! Back-water to starboard! Back</seg><seg type="columnLine">her against the swell an' keep her nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the beach."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden spit of musket-fire tore the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. The pursuers, increased by sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers from taverns and by the beach</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrol returned from its rounds, hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried along the wake of the running Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icans. Tom's men had a pistol each.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crowd had muskets and bayonets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One volley would settle the matter. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly a shrill command cut the uproar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire!" it said. "Fire, you petrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">camels. Give fire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some one kicked open a lantern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked out the candle and set fire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some dried beech-grass that flamed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared with a fine crackle. Two muskets</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As though those shots were a signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wild yell broke out in the night and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden wave of half-crazy men burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the startled group. Desperate men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven half crazy by the memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wrongs, drove down upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled soldiery. One soldier had a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of that wave. He turned to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a wild yell:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Les negres," he shouted in shrill-ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cented terror. The wild Negroes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills are on us. Fire, men! Fire!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was time for neither words nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation. No man needed to be told</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened. If that crowd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Negroes overcame them every man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that crowd knew what it meant. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant a death of unbelievable torture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a brief second they stood ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">palled; then some one had sense enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to direct a volley. A score of muskets</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed and roared. In the melee Tom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men turned and hurried for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoreline and almost hurled their pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner at the boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The incredible had happened. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild Negroes had done what they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never dared do before; they had raided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the French lines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">QUIN, at bow, stood on no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremony. He reached out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his eight-foot boat-hook,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inserted the hook between</seg><seg type="columnLine">collar and neck of the breathless pri?</seg><seg type="columnLine">82</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner and pulled. And Alphonse de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berrien came like a netted land-crab,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Tom, with Baker and Black and</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Etion, fought and struggled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spume of the black wave that fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly to kill any white man. Les</seg><seg type="columnLine">blancs had no friends in Haiti, any more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than they have today.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wave surged forward with yelps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouts and Jacmel woke in terror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The loud, shrill rattle of the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums turned out startled troops; shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">bugles yelped for aid and were answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the dark jungle by the deep roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and throb of the great Raba voodoo</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums from the distant hills, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">flares of red fire lit the sky. Too late</seg><seg type="columnLine">the French commander of the city guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized his mistake. Fever, dysentery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and debaucheries had loosed bonds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">discipline; they could not be tightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately the wild men had no idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">oi' how general was the terror. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not planned a real attack. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a raid for arms. They were armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rude pikes made by plantation</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiths, with a few stolen pistols and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fowling pieces--mostly with cane-knives</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in Connecticut and reshaped by</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage labor--but those weapons were</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly in the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mob filled the fosse; they drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">back overpowered guards and snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">muskets from their nerveless hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They turned the captured bayonets on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the French and cut down a patrol to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last man, while French drums shrilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rattled the alarm and the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured out to their defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The attackers knew their limitations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could not hope to hold or loot</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place against organized French sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diery. That might come later. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had put the fear of God into French</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts that night. A series of shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">yells recalled the wariest and the ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the half-moon of fighters drew quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, seeking the cover of the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the frigates in the harbor could</seg><seg type="columnLine">open fire. The line drew swiftly back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the men at the end on the beach</seg><seg type="columnLine">were suddenly aware of Tom and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men struggling to get their prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the boat. They knew they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">get him off to the schooner before those</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy French frigates could learn of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scorpion's arrival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All white men were alike to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzied crowd. The French Republic</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had promised freedom while it</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept them in slavery could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusted. All white men were foes. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in that crowd men freshly brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Africa who held life cheap and</seg><seg type="columnLine">well paid for, if in dying they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill even one of their foes. Here were</seg><seg type="columnLine">white men before them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pebbled beach supplied them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition. In a second a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks rattled against the boat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed in the water. De Berrien went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a-sprawl; Black fell headlong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned by a great rock. Quin jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">both men into the boat and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a scalp-wound from a flung cane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife. He scrambled to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a hand to Tom, who was stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gering knee-deep through the water un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the impact of a stone that sent him</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbling. Then a light surge of surf</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove the boat beachward. In another</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment she would beach and be</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamped by the crowd of fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Negroes and every man murdered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Americans!" shouted Quin desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately. "We are Americans. I tell you we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not French; we are Americans!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he had better have held his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. A hundred blacks surged across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach; then a man recognized de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berrien. The sight of him was like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of a fox to dogs. Tom staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the boat's stem and set his shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shove off into deep water," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted above the roar of the sea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crazy yells of the mob. "They'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp you. Give a hand here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boat gave way slowly and slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SCORPION</seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch by inch across the sand. Then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom set his foot on the sharp edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coral, a rock as big as an orange struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him full on the back of the head. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged forward and fell face-down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shallow water. His last thrust sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocking boat off the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tom Swayne never knew how long</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lay in the water, nor how he ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">got out of it. He seemed to have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust through with sharp blades; each</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath that he drew seemed to pierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">him anew. Two men picked him up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">both arms and rushed him along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle trail behind the mass of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jubilant, retreating Negroes. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed a dozen men; they had overcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strong patrol; they had fired several</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses. They had even carried one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the batteries and had spiked its guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">with nails brought for that purpose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind them the delirious rattle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">infantry drums continued to sound the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally his captors set Tom down. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to rise but his feet seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighted with lead. Heavy brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratched his face. He fell like a sack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. The next thing he knew a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shining in his face and Etion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cap'n," he whispered. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaking that slurring speech that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etion had picked up in the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carolinas. "Cap'n, is yo' daid?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Huh?" Tom struggled to a sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">posture and drew a shuddering breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some Negroes had lighted a fire; by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoky light he saw the motley crew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almost all were naked to the waist. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">were striped with red and yellow ochre</seg><seg type="columnLine">or barred with paint and blood. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wounded and the dried blood had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caked and dried on their wounds. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them were crazy drunk or on the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become so; some on the rum found in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every French canteen but most with</seg><seg type="columnLine">success, the headiest wine of all. A black</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant in the blue-and-gold coat of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">French commissary of customs, waving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a naked cane-knife, drove the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside with frenzied yells. Through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">graying dawn that filtered through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle Tom's fevered brain heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums. Their throbbing beat was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pulsations of a fevered brain. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">black giant snatched Etion aside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieked at him; Etion shrinking aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered shrilly. Tom heard the words;</seg><seg type="columnLine">even his slight knowledge of French told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him their meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said hotly, waving both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. "No! Not French. American."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chaos broke out anew and then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">coma.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE TORTURE BOWL</seg><seg type="columnLine">A SINGING insect hum</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted his return to conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. His head ached; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth was as dry as a lime-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kiln; every limb was stiff and sore. Full</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization came as Etion bent over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He sat up and swore:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where in hell are we?" he asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etion shook his head and nodded at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. It was open and Tom could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see outside. Then he glanced about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face changed. The room was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet square and was walled with al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most solid masonry. A thatched roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead rustled and moved as tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">house-lizards ran to and fro. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open plank door he caught oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casional glimpses of a sentry, musket</seg><seg type="columnLine">on shoulder. The sentry was as black</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Erebus and was clad in leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeches, blood-stained, a dirty shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a torn straw hat; his bare feet pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ded like a monkey's as he walked before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etion said grimly, "They are my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, Cap'n. They are slaves 'at ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the French."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then we have no cause to worry,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Tom. "We're not French."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All whites are the same to them," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etion. "Here they come. We will see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they mean to do with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two men entered the room. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word to either prisoner, they took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long table, carried it outside and set it</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a giant tree. A crowd of men at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once surged up to it and stood waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom's eager eyes scanned that crowd.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was more or less accustomed to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves in his own land, but these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly different from any he had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">S' en. Slaves were there who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarred by lash and branding irons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-naked men, wholly desperate by</seg><seg type="columnLine">French cruelties. Their faces showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bestial elation at their success. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had decimated a French patrol; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had burned some houses; they had cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured a considerable quantity of arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most satisfactory of all, they had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">some prisoners on whom they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreak their hate. Their excited jabber</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to Tom on a gale that reeked of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat and blood and dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A giant Negro shouted for silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His voice sounded like the inarticulate</seg><seg type="columnLine">howl of a bayed beast but Tom could</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguish every word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bring the prisoners here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tom set his teeth. No white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a chance with these people. Know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing something of French and Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruelties to slaves, he could not wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame these men. But he realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own condition was desperate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four men armed with short pikes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cane-knives broke into a run. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed Tom's open door and he won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered vaguely what had happened. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a muffled shout broke the hush and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men came, urging a white man at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">points of their pikes. His hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed behind his back; his blue sailor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket was torn from collar to skirt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face was a mask of half-dried blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At sight of him Etion snatched at Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Porton!" he hissed. He shook from</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What? You're crazy. Etion." Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked the man to his feet. Porton the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirate--that?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etion fairly babbled: "Why wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know 'im? Didn't f tell you how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken my daughter? No man forgets 'at.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suh. I see him three, two times when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">workin' as boy for ma'amnelle. Ees man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Porton come see Monsieur Le Clave too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look, Cap'n--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Tom's eyes were on the man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Could Etion be right? Was this indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Porton? Long-twelve Porton, for whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships scoured the seven seas, whose name</seg><seg type="columnLine">was known for cruelty from Port o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spain to Cap llaytien?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even among big men Porton would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been classed as huge. Men any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where would have called him handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">but for his cruel mouth and a sinister</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of glare in his blue-gray eyes. Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed him fascinatedly and wondered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How had Porton been takeu prisoner by</seg><seg type="columnLine">these escaped slaves? Etion's excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabber sounded loud to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, Cap'n," he almost shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"See 'at big man? I know 'im too." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to the black leader, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as huge as Porton. " "At man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">name Jorveaux.

The big</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, Porton, his hands fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, was being urged forward at four</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody pike-points, the centre of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">surging, shouting mass of half-crazy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodthirsty blacks. Tom's tongue licked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sticky line of his dry lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SCORPION</seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jorveaux's voice boomed out; every</seg><seg type="columnLine">word was clearly audible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Two months ago your ship beached</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the barrier reef off Simone River.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The French were after you to hang you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all your men; we helped you. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">men took out your cargo, careened your</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and helped you in every way when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you repaired it. Your men lived ashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us. They eat our food. They drank</seg><seg type="columnLine">our rum. They took our women. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">because we hated the French even worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">than you did we helped you. We re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded your ship and not even an iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolt was lost. In return for that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised to bring us a cargo of arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were to buy from you with</seg><seg type="columnLine">French gold. We got your water-butts</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled and you put to sea. Then . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jorveaux struggled hard for self-con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol and a little white foam lay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners of his mouth as he worked him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self into a fury. His men knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood and backed away from him but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four pike-men prodded Porton</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then our enemies, the French, of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered you aid," said Jorveaux. "How do</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know? You fool, we have agents in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every house where the French have</seg><seg type="columnLine">black servants or where French officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">take black or brown mistresses. We know</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that takes place. If a Frenchman</seg><seg type="columnLine">itches we know where. Four days ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">your ship dropped anchor in the har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bor and you offered to sell to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman the arms that you promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on . . Porton struggled hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to free his arms but the bejuce vines</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bound them held like iron; great</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat drops ran down his face. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first thing I knew, those two damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">frigates were anchored alongside me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Either one could blow me out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Some of my men disclosed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that I had arms and powder under</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatches. The military governor threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened me if I did not let him have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. That's all there was to it, Jor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veaux. I tell you I had no choice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strained against the bejuce vines;</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet by sweat and worn a little by sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den chafing, that vine gave a little. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerk and his hands were free. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick swing he gathered two pike-mcn</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his arms and swept them together</seg><seg type="columnLine">till their heads cracked like a land-crab</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly stepped on. He flung both</seg><seg type="columnLine">men aside and snatched at a falling pike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd sucked suddenly back like</seg><seg type="columnLine">poplars in a wind. Instinctive fear of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man gripped them for a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. In that moment Porton's pike</seg><seg type="columnLine">went home in the soft tissues of a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">belly and he fell with a half-moan, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shriek, as Porton broke for the safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the jungle was fifty yards away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the crowd was on his heels like</seg><seg type="columnLine">hounds after a fox. A pike, flung straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his legs, tripped him; he fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily and a dozen men hurled them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves on him. They jerked him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, naked to the waist, dragged him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to where Jorveaux stood by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. He was breathing hard and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were stony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Taladrohe said shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden yell went up from the crowd.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE word meant nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom, but Etion caught his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath in a sob, as a half-dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">men dragged Porton across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, spread-eagled him upon it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed his hands and feet to the frame.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they passed other ropes and vines</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his body until he was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">swathed in ropes. Tom could see his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great hairy chest rising and falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempestuously as he fought for a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. At a word from Jorveaux, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men quickly brought a scoopful of live</seg><seg type="columnLine">embers from a fire, while two other men</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted along the edge of the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">till they found a tree that seemed to suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They came back presently with</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">a calabash that they set on the table by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Porton's head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lashed fast to the table frame by</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and feet, swathed by ropes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bejuce vines, Porton could barely move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sun-glare in Tom's eyes blinded him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he managed to see a man snatch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged shirt from Porton's chest. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">another man seized the calabash, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it upside down and swiftly removed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell; another man adjusted in its place</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little brass bowl, on the upturned bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom of which a man laid a few live em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers. Then all stood back to await de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eyes of the now silent crowd cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered on the bound Porton. Helpless, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay motionless, save for the heaving of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest. Tom turned to Etion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil," he asked, "are</seg><seg type="columnLine">they waiting for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Taladro," said Etion, shivering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You said that before," said Tom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That doesn't tell me much. What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">taladro mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Taladro," said Etion again as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">that explained all. " 'At man Jorveaux,</seg><seg type="columnLine">*e been onetime slave in Porto Rico,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cap'n. 'E know taladro. 'E borer w'at</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore in wood. Big beetle, Cap'n. 'E</seg><seg type="columnLine">borer." Etiftn made a twisting, boring</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion with his hands that left nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the imagination. "Dem men w'at went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tree caught borers. Dey come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' put taladros on 'at man Porton an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover 'em up wid 'at brass cup.

No</seg><seg type="columnLine">way can get away, 'ceptin' they eat out</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Porton! Him eat quick through</seg><seg type="columnLine">live flesh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God," said Tom and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick as a shriek of agony from Porton</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang out above the yells. Then another</seg><seg type="columnLine">shriek and scream on scream as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">taladro took hold and tried to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his heating prison by gnawing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way through living tissues. The giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame of the pirate surged and swelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his bonds but they would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">give. Finally, at a signal from Jorveax,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man raised the brass bowl and Jor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veax stepped close to his victim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you can not endure one taladro,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how will you stand five?" he asked. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours they can eat through a foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid timber. The next will be placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over your heart. It will be a very slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">death and not pleasant. If you die by</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, it will be your own choice. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will carry out my orders all may yet be</seg><seg type="columnLine">well with you. Will you get for me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and the powder?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Porton struggled for speech but words</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not come. He nodded heavily and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flake of heavy spume blew from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. His breath came sobbingly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest rose and fell like a broken bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows. Jorveaux eyed him closely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cut him loose," he said. "He will</seg><seg type="columnLine">do what I ask. But there is yet pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to be made for the man lie killed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two men cut Porton loose and Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a long red welt on his chest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twin trickles of blood that ran slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his torso.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rum," said Jorveaux shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man held a coconut dipper of rum</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Porton's lips.

Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my men got drunk and talked too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. They boasted of havin' taken the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish ship so the French learned about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The next thing I knew, two of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned frigates anchored by me. I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">move without their knowin' it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">French military governor sent for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told me they would take the arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and powder at their own price.

Do we get the arms?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Porton nodded briefly. "You get 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I can make it, but I'm damned if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how I can get 'em to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let him get up," said Jorveaux.</seg><seg type="columnLine">PORTON struggled to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, a hideous figure.

"I'll have to figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">some way to get the arms to you. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will take my ship out if I have to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">both French frigates.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jorveaux laughed. "I was field over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seer for le Compte de Tours," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I learned there to trust no man.

He seized a pen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drove it squealing across the paper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When it was done Jorveaux took it gin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerly and examined it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you lied to me," he said, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will pay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hold on a minute," said Porton</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically. "If my ship is beached on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reefs I am ruined. She will be lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all hands. I can't lose my crew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She carries over a hundred men. . . ."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I promise you your life. But only</seg><seg type="columnLine">you." said Jorveaux. And his eyes hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here," thought Tom: "I'll see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of a man he is. He will never sac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifice his men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She will be lost with all hands," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Porton again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will see that she is," said Jorveaux</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "You alone are being given a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to escape. If you had not killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man, your crew would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">spared, perhaps."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Porton showed his relief. He dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not explain that his great fear had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some man of that crew might es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape. Every man in that crew knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hidden loot on El Cubil, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">no man knew the soundings of the chan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel that led to the only anchorage. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the soundings of the channel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to the only anchorage. He had too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much buried loot on El Cubil to take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Send the letter," he said hoarsely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Clay," muttered Tom. "an' damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotten clay too. Sacrifices his whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew to save his dirty hide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jorveaux pouched the letter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to his men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guard this man carefully." he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Put him in the stone house with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> others and place two sentries at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Porton was dragged away by a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen men. Tom was still staring out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the blinding sunlight when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulked in the doorway. At sight of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etion came to life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It ees our turn now, Cap'n," he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLOOD O' THE BUCCANEERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ONE glance at that group</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Tom his danger. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodlust was on them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they surged across the clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, shouting and shrieking. A man</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought from the house a buckct of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rum. They drank it like water, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">surged over to surround Tom and Etion</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they were dragged before Jorveaux.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom called to Etion sharply:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell him that a mistake has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made about us," he said. "Tell him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are not enemies. We are at war with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the French as he is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Etion paid no attention to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His quick eyes had seen a little canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">wallet that had fallen from Porton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt when he was stretched on the table;</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his eyes focused on Jorveaux, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">questing feet slowly worked the wallet</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside. It passed unseen simply because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd was so interested in the tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of the talad.ro that they had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention for lesser things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Talk to 'im, Cap'n," said Etion. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mus' get this. It b'long to 'at man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Porton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom glanced quickly about him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no idea what ferment was at work</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Etion's head but he felt sure he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a reason for what he did. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">distract the attention of that crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">long enough to let Etion get that wallet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen . . ." He stepped forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced Jorveaux with upraised hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"French guns, you fools!" he shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen!" And as though done by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SCORPION</seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg><seg type="columnLine">own hands a sudden long crash sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the jungle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crash was heaven sent. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">man leaped aside and sprang for cover.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some snatched cane-knives and pikes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few grabbed muskets; they stood quiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering, waiting for orders. Jorveaux</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that they were on edge. Stam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pede would come next. He seized a pike-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and threw him almost across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quiet!" he shouted. "Have you never</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a tree split before? It was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">capilan tree. You know how they split."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They looked at each other and drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the table where Etion stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect. Tom glanced at him, then at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground at his feet. That moment had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been enough. Then Jorveaux turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. a black fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say you are Americans." he</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared. "All white men are alike to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">this day. White men brought us out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Africa, from Guinea and .sold us into</seg><seg type="columnLine">slavery. White men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be a fool . . ." Tom flung a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelling pike-man aside and faced Jor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veaux. "Every man who is a slave here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a slave in Africa before. You only</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed a worse slavery for this. I tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you we are Americans. If you are ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies of the French, so are we. I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to fight the French. You say you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want arms. I'll get them for you. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">men are better fighters than yours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have better arms. Last night with</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men I captured the military gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor. He is now on my ship off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast. As we were getting back to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat your men mistook us for the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took me and my man prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we were putting de Berrien on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board my boat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jorveaux wavered. The facts known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him bore out what this white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">said but he did not choose to trust any</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man. Then Etion spoke. Tie jab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered excitedly with frenzied gestures</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost foamed at the mouth. Jor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veaux asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How does it happen that you, a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, a papaloi of our own people, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am free . . ." Etion drew himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with dignity. "I am as free as Agoue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">god of the sea. I serve this white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">for two reasons. Listen, Jorveaux, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know all you are and have been. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know who I am and why and how I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate the French. I tell you that other</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man, Porton, is a thief and a mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derer. He has already killed one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He shall pay for that when we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">got his powder and arms," snarled Jor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veaux. Then he turned to Tom: "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I set you free will you give me de Ber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rien?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you want him for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To be sawed into inches," said Jor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veaux fiercely. "He had my two sons</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot last month as rebels. Will you give</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Tom coolly. "The man is</seg><seg type="columnLine">my prisoner. I too need arms and pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der to fight the French and the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">must supply them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then get the arms that Porton has</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bring them to me. Do that and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will give you . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Porton?" asked Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jorveaux laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I free you," he said, "will you</seg><seg type="columnLine">make de Berrien free Porton's ship, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the arms can be landed where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can get them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom hesitated a moment. His account</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay with Porton. Porton had robbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father on the high seas and had mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered young Sykes. Porton must pay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But if Porton was left in the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these savages he would be tortured to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. He had already seen what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do. No white man could con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nive at torture, even for a Porton. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to settle his account with Porton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he must do it in his own way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must have time to think it over,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said dully. "Give me time."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jorveaux stared at him. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand this delay. He motioned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put these in the old stone house with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Porton," he said. He turned to Tom:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have till morning to decide. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet my demands I will free you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">help you. If you refuse, you and Porton</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall die the same death. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what that will be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men seized both Tom and Etion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hustled them into the little hut;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the heavy plank door slammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut behind them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a moment the cool dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was like a wet bandage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Tom's aching eyes; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">things took form in the dusk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A low groan made him glance hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. That was Porton. Iron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerved though the man was, he had col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsed after his experience. He lay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huddle in a corner of the room, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms wide, his face smeared with sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blood, his wide eyes staring at Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Etion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who the bloody 'ell are you?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded hotly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An American," said Tom. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me you're the famous Long-twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">Porton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The 'ell they do? Yus.

If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want to know, I own the Iris</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner . . ." He gave the Scorpion</seg><seg type="columnLine">her old name. "I've been doin' a bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tradin' among the islands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye," Porton grunted scornfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know you damned Yankees.

Two ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">can do your work better than one. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">you need in your business is a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner like mine. If I'd scouted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harbor for you before you entered it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd never have got you four between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two frigates. Suppose you had a schoon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er like mine. She could hang on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish flanks and keep tabs on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships sailin'. They've got silver and gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipments to be picked up. This war</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Europe has sent up all prices too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">See? It can be done for a price."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see. Pilot fish fer a shark, eh?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Porton, grinning. "If we was clear o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">this hell-hole it might work. Did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear what they said to me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. And I saw what they did. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not done with 'em yet.

"And all the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">loves a privateer. I'd as soon sail on The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Account."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You git me clear o' this damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">place," said Porton, "an' you an' me'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">sail on The Account.

He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe it, of course, but he felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must placate old Etion who did be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve. He took the canvas wallet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etion and opened it. It was a roughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">made sort of a pocket-book, with two</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside pockets that were stuffed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers. He turned it over listlessly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not interested in it, though Etion</seg><seg type="columnLine">had considered it so important. His mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on other things. God! If he only had</seg><seg type="columnLine">this devil Porton where he could exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">full payment. Tom did not especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">care about Porton's crimes against so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciety; he was concerned with his offenses</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the house of Swayne that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbed and against the boy whom he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had murdered. He meant to call Por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton to account for that.

What's this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a many-folded, crackling paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fell from the wallet as he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over and over in his hands.

It was a rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketch, drawn on heavy watered paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed with yellow linen and stained by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat and use. As he unfolded it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few words stood out plainly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ANCHORAGE OF EL CUBIL.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom let go a gusty oath and Etion</seg><seg type="columnLine">started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Look here," Tom pointed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketch.

He mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned to Etion and took his stand un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the hole, while Etion, agile as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monkey, swarmed up his shoulders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached with both hands at the roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That thatch came away at first in</seg><seg type="columnLine">handfuls of dirt and dust, then in tufts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dry grass and palm leaves. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">a two-foot hole yawned above them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outside the yelling and the raucous</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter still kept up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etion ran to the door and glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a crack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More men come," he said. " 'At</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean more rum, Cap'n. W'en they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk we go. W'at about dis?" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed at Porton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom hesitated. What about Porton?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etion chortled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jorveaux saw him in pieces bimeby."</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was true. It was also true that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom knew that he could not leave even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long-twelve Porton to such a death. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen a part of the devilish tortures</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflicted by that blood-mad crew. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Porton must be saved from that. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned over him and shook him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness. Porton sat up dazedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep quiet if you love life," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom fiercely. He was doing a thing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated. Every instinct was to leave Por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton--but he could not do that. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd's drunk outside," he said. "We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug a hole in the roof. It's our only</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. God help us if we fail now. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Porton knew what failure meant for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, at least. He rose, twitched at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt and they joined Etion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Etion first," said Tom. "He's lightest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You go after him. When you're up, low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SCORPION</seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg><seg type="columnLine">er your belt for me. I'll need a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a word Etion scrambled to Tom's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, leaped for the roof, caught it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with both hands and disappeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dusk. He thrust his skinny arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and pulled Porton scuffling to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatch; then the belt was lowered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom. A moment later the three men</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay low on the roof, watching the drunk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en Negroes at the fires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slide down on the dark side," mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered Tom. "It's only a few yards to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle's edge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A quick slide, a rustling fall and Etion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was down. Tom went next and Porton</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell on him like an avalanche. Keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the low brush, they slipped into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow jungle path and stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What now?" growled Porton. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no safety this side of the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"There's none there for me," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom briefly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's my port," said Porton. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'll shoot you when they know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're a Yankee. You better hide till you</seg><seg type="columnLine">kin get away by sea. You said you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a schooner off the coast. Can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know. I'll have to," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom grimly. What a fool he was, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, to let this damned pirate go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He might, never have another chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">square accounts. And he already had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chart to El Cubil. With Porton</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone he could make his way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scorpion, get to El Cubil and loot the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, save his father. Damn Porton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why could he not forget Porton?</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Etion'll come with me," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said Porton, "Hi 'ope our</seg><seg type="columnLine">courses cross later.

He passed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thick brush and spoke over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. "The on'y other Yankee I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowed was the skipper of that damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark Catherine I took, Nyme o' Swayne,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was.

What terrible signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cance lay behind that past tense? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck Tom like a blow. He repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words and did not know that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye." Porton spoke carelessly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed 'em all three--the Yankee skip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per, the lobster-back an' 'is daughter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good-lookin' piece she is. too--a bit o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire an' flame if you ask me.

He got his</seg><seg type="columnLine">payment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" Tom's mouth was harsh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry and little flashes of light seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break inside his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A half ounce o' lead where it done</seg><seg type="columnLine">him most good." said Porton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The brush crackled. The bamboos</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustled like iron rods as they clicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">into place behind him. The next mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment he was gone and the blackness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle swallowed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg><seg type="columnLine">LETTERS OF MARQUE</seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY headed into the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the jungle and worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way along narrow paths.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great trees, heavy with wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthed orchids, overhung them;</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorny vines snatched at them. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were half naked when they debouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a coral beach, on which a ripple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of low surf broke. The starlight, dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough in the jungle, seemed like dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them and the sea-rim stood out</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the sky as though drawn in In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dia ink. Tom threw himself face down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the beach and stared off into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. If the schooner was in the offing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes would pick her up against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon. There was nothing. The ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the horizon was unbroken. His heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank as he turned to Etion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll get back to those coco-palms,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "We'll need the nuts when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun rises. We dare not come into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open by daylight to look for food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They went back for the clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms, returned back for the beach with</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms full.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep to the loose dry sand," Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautioned. "We must not leave foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prints. We must hide till we find some</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to get away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They found a hiding place among</seg><seg type="columnLine">some great rocks on a little point that</seg><seg type="columnLine">jutted out in a miniature cape; and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay hidden there all day. Night brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief and they bathed several times in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea and ate the coconuts they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun rose on an empty sea in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blaze of white-hot mist that gave way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a copper glare; they baked under it</seg><seg type="columnLine">until a wind from the sea blew a ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute rain squall. They alternately</seg><seg type="columnLine">stewed and roasted till the sun dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the line of the jungle and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">waked to life once more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'd better get as far from here as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can," said Tom. He had been pon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering all day long what had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and considering their best plan of es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape. By himself Etion would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no trouble but he refused to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom. Tom turned to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here, Etion," he said. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you do with that canvas wallet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put ovunga in him," said Etion.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an ordinary fisherman's canoe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some eighteen feet long; it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollowed by fire and adze from a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottonwood log, but it was seaworthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it held a net and a pair of paddles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom leaped for it, thrust it into deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, put his load of coconuts in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern-sheets and almost threw Etion in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it. Then he waded knee-deep in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm water, stepped over the low gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wale and picked up a paddle, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etion took the other and settled him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self cross-legged in the bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If'n 'em men o' Jorveaux's is in de</seg><seg type="columnLine">bresh dey may see us," he said warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No matter now. They can't walk on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water." Tom's voice rose on a jubi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lant note. "They may find another</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe, but we've got to risk that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They made a good offing. To help</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters out for food and to deceive any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who might see them, Tom lay down;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etion laid the net and took a paddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sat hunched up in the boat as any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fisherman would have sat watching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day seemed a million years long.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both men grunted with relief as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun began to drop behind the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree-line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well, Etion--" Tom rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched to his full height.

Tom almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">upset the crazy piroque as he drove his</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle deep. "There's only one thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that catches sunlight like that--new can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vas. That's the head of a fore-and-aft</seg><seg type="columnLine">sail catchin' the settin' sun!''</seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY paddled hard for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour; inch by inch the silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">point rose. First it was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, then two. It meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing much to Etion but Tom's heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look," he shouted jubilantly. "Can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see, boy? That's the head of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore-and-aft foresail. We only saw one</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot o' light at first, because she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">headin' right for us. Then she bore off</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit and we opened her mainsail. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fore-and-aft schooner--and an Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ican."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etion shook his head. "Most likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">French, Cap'n," he said. "Hard to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bit of it. Only Americans use</seg><seg type="columnLine">cotton canvas for sails. That canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">is as white as snow.

She's</seg><seg type="columnLine">headin' right for us. but she's not sight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed us yet. There comes the terral," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said as the land-wind began to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the land. "That'll mean a shift of</seg><seg type="columnLine">helm for her." He watched eagerly till</seg><seg type="columnLine">the schooner headed off a little and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a slant at her from a different angle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took one long look from under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, then sat down and began to pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle frantically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's my own schooner, the Scor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pion," he said breathlessly. "Look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that patch in the foot of the main top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mast staysail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Etion grunted, none the wiser, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom went on:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See that patch o' new canvas? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed Flynn for that. One day back</seg><seg type="columnLine">home he forgot to take the staysail off</seg><seg type="columnLine">her when we tacked. The fore-gaff tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">hell out of it. That's the Scorpion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Etion. Head up for her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under the urge of Tom's tongue Etion</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked like two men and the little pir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oque danced like a chip in a spill-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Scorpion, running free, drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on her. A sharp yell from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner's bows made Jerry Lynn, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quarter-deck, stop in his short</seg><seg type="columnLine">stride. Then he leaped forward. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little later the Scorpion ran up well to</seg><seg type="columnLine">windward, luffed and lay with her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">sails shaking, the piroque dancing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken water under her lee. Every man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the schooner's crew lined the rail and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long yell went up when Tom, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Etion, climbed aboard. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment Lynn had Tom by both hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ives came running from the bows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord, sir, but we're glad to have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">back." Ives' voice told more than his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere words. "What happened, sir?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come down into the cabin," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom. "I've got a lot to tell you. First</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all, where's de Berrien?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sulkin' in the cuddy," Lynn grinned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's sore as a blind bear. At first he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a lot o' trouble but old Ben here</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracked him over the bows with a caulk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' mallet. After that he saw the light."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What did he have to say?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd hate to repeat it to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lynn grinned. "In English it 'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound just too bad. In French it sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed like five cats fightin'. I gather that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bein' a Frog, he can't understand what</seg><seg type="columnLine">right we had to take him prisoner. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been all right to ketch King</seg><seg type="columnLine">George or President Adams but to ketch</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was the sin against the Holy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ghost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll see him," said Tom: "You and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ives come with me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">SEATED at the litle cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, Alphonse de Berrien,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Demi-Brigadier of the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">armies, Military Governor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haiti, glanced up as the three men en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the cabin. He was a portly man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to good living; and his resentment</seg><seg type="columnLine">at having been snatched away from it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was evident. At sight of the three men</seg><seg type="columnLine">he burst into a torrent of invective. Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled at him and waited for the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">to subside. Then:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you speak English?" he asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">General de Berrien nodded. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">does this outrage mean, m'sieur?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Outrage?" Tom grinned. "Faith, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it means that an American privateer has</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the brazen effrontery to raid a</seg><seg type="columnLine">French port and to carry off its gover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor as a prisoner. It may mean more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that, General de Berrien. War</seg><seg type="columnLine">exists between your country and mine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am an American privateer.

I will show you my letters if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you doubt what I say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> General de Berrien made a motion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissent. Tom went on:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am doing to you exactly what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself have authorized Porton to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us. Long-twelve Porton, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">notorious pirate the Spanish Main has</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen since the days of Carew and Frome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This man Porton was with you. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights ago. He dined with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are wrong, sir." General de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berrien almost spat in high disgust. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is true that he was brought to see me</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my office.

He made war under</seg><seg type="columnLine">French colors on a friendly nation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom it will be suicidal for France to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have armed conflict. He has planned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sell those arms to the slaves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> General de Berrien's face turned a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep mulberry color; his lips set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You seem to believe what you tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, monsieur," he said. "I ask where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you learned this, or think you learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will lay all my cards on the table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First, please remember this: I have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to lie to you. I went ashore at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jacmel three nights ago with the intent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of capturing you if possible.

Carefully avoiding any</seg><seg type="columnLine">reference to the taking of the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">merchantman, he gave all the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the details and painted a word picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his shore adventure that made Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral de Berrien sit up. He told how Jor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veaux had made his deal with Porton</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the arms on the Belle of Bristol,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how Porton had agreed to sacrifice his</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire crew to earn his own safety. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluded with:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you know now, Monsieur,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how and where these slaves get the arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">that make it possible for them to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit crimes that offend the world. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SCORPION</seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg><seg type="columnLine">get them from Porton. He sends his</seg><seg type="columnLine">partner, Batten, to discover the sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">dates of ships going under neutral flags;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, with his own ship under French</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors, he takes those ships. He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been robbing and killing citizens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">countries with whom France certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not desire to go to war."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From all of which," said de Berrien:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I gather that you, sir, have some per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal grievance against this Porton."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have, sir. He owes me a debt so</seg><seg type="columnLine">great that I can hope you will not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">present when it is paid." A spasm twist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed Tom's face. "In the meantime, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lynn." he said with a return to his best</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter-deck manner, "will you kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">set all sail and give the steerman a</seg><seg type="columnLine">course that will bring us in to Jacmel?</seg><seg type="columnLine">We will run in under a flag of truce, sir."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What the devil. . . .?" Jerry Lynn</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at him as though he believed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain had lost his mind and Ives sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounded. But Tom merely grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nodded confirmation of his order.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lynn went slowly on deck and Ives and</seg><seg type="columnLine">de Berrien sat eyeing Tom in silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could not fathom what was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now about my ransom, sir," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Frenchman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no question of ransom. Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral," said Tom. "I had certain plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">for which your presence was necessary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tell you frankly, sir, that I intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to exchange you for Porton. These plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">have now been changed and your pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence is not necessary to me. I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter Jacmel harbor under a flag of</seg><seg type="columnLine">truce and my boat will set you ashore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can only say, sir, that I regret that</seg><seg type="columnLine">exigencies of war have made necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hardships to which you have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjected."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Frenchman sat astounded. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while words failed him. Then:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir," he began. And again: "Sir . . ."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could say no more. Tom waved a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and refilled both glasses. "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">not told you all, sir, because my per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal affairs would only embarrass you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My account lies with this man Porton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All else fades into insignificance. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief difficulty lies in the fact that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not meet Porton on the high seas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He keeps under the protection of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">batteries."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Not now, Monsieur General de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berrien uttered a sharp oath. "True,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man has carried on his operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">under letters of marque issued to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">under my own hand and seal. But under</seg><seg type="columnLine">those letters he has made war on friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly governments. He has given or sold</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms to the foes of France. He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed women and children. Can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt, Monsieur, what I will do? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I am free I will declare this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Porton to be the pirate that he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved himself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady, sir." Tom smiled a little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have but my unsupported word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Will you hear what a free Negro has to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say? He may perhaps be known to you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His name is Etion. He knows much</seg><seg type="columnLine">that took place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Etion le Grand?

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">half an hour Etion came out of the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was followed by de Berrien. Tom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a look at him, motioned to Lynn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Helm over," he said. "And give her</seg><seg type="columnLine">all she'll carry. Head for Jacmel."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They raised the red-and-white-and-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow houses just before dusk. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">big French frigates to port and star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board of the big yellow corvette loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like ships of the line. At sight of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white flag fluttering on the Scorpion, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat shot from the Quai des Marines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, after a moment of tangled speech,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooked on to the Scorpion's rail. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">General de Berrien rushed on deck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung his arms about Tom, who stood by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weather rail. The little Frenchman</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped all English as he almost em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced his captor:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Adieu, mon brave," he said; then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a quick rush of words, "This man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Porton shall never find refuge under</seg><seg type="columnLine">French colors."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boat dropped away from the rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Lynn turned to Tom, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">studying the corvette through half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"WELL," said Jerry.

Everett ApKn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">D. S. O., six months later.)</seg><seg type="columnLine">IT'S all a bit foggy now, sir, but I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can give you the main facts. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly seems possible that all those fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaps could have been done-in the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">you say. And poor Mr. Darrington, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a splendid gentleman, really. I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought Jerry would ever put his star up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed to have a charmed life. You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardon me, sir, but the whole thing has</seg><seg type="columnLine">come as a bit of a shock. I never dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such a thing could happen. Although</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions were a bit out of the ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night. You see, sir. the lieutenant</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't in the habit of taking more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two men out with him--five at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most--and we used to take turns. I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been out with him any number of times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our methods were always about the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we all knew his ways, and thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world and all of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whenever he had decided to go out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a job. those of us whose turn it was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompany him, would line up behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and crawl on hands and knees into</seg><seg type="columnLine">No Man's Land as far as we could go.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we'd wiggle forward on our bellies</seg><seg type="columnLine">--one behind the other--each with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand on the foot of the bloke ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our pistols ready, and a bag of grenades</seg><seg type="columnLine">slung in back. Mr. Darrington used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal to us by clicking the finger nails</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his thumb and third finger. Like this!</seg><seg type="columnLine">When we got near Jerry's lines, he used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop now and then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was most cautious and, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had no fear whatever, sir, he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">took unnecessary chances. He'd click</seg><seg type="columnLine">once if he wanted us to come up in line</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the left, and twice to come up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, and so on--whatever signals he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged beforehand. When he had us</seg><seg type="columnLine">in position, all headed toward the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were to bomb, he'd scrape his finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nail across his helmet--slow like. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the signal for each man to get his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grenades ready, take a bomb, pull the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin, and stand ready to let fly. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'd wait until he yelled "Throw."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fire." or some such command, and we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise up and let them have it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first couple of flashes usually gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">us our target and we'd peg till our bombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone and then scatter and sneak</seg><seg type="columnLine">back as best we could. It wasn't difficult,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir, for we always surprised them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rarely had an opportunity to defend</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves. But oftentimes we'd have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lay low outside the wire for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before the machine-guns stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversing and the shell-fire died down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was the main danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we'd sneak back. And Mr. Dar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rington always tried to get back into our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own lines without being challenged. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact after we'd left the fixed trench lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were working in the open, he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered it downright disgraceful for us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be seen or heard even by our own out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posts. And we all got to be right smart</seg><seg type="columnLine">at our jobs; Jerry didn't get on to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">often.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fact is, we lost very few men while</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrolling or raiding. Mr. Darrington had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a keen nose for defiladed ground, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night, and he moved about like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghost. The men got to know him as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kitten, which while not very respectful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like, certainly fit him to a tee. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty slick article, sir, 'pon my word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You could hear the others now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE KITTEN</seg><seg type="columnLine">101</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, but you could never hear him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But you want to hear about what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened that last night. You'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pardon me, sir, if I ramble a bit, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that I'm on it, it all comes back</seg><seg type="columnLine">very clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, sir, you see we had been out</seg><seg type="columnLine">every night for weeks and we'd lost a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men--mostly from shell fire. We lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">far more that way than when out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Darrington. As a matter of fact, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time there were only thirteen of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, including Sgt. Hanley. Well, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">late that afternoon Mr. Darrington came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and told us he was going to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole lot of us out that night. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't seem to be quite himself as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">describing the job to us. We had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted anything just like it before</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we didn't care for it even a little bit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't think that he did either, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was determined to go through with it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to no end of trouble to explain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After dark he went up to the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">again with Sgt. Hanley to explore a gap</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had found under the German wire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gap had been caused by water run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning out of a drain in the low part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy trench. The drain, a narrow sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gully-like, started from under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire, where it had washed away the dirt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran back to the front edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parapet. It was about five feet deep at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that point, I should judge. Then it went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a tunnel--some ten feet long--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected with the floor of the trench</seg><seg type="columnLine">and just large enough for a man to crawl</seg><seg type="columnLine">through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plan was for us to slip under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wire and wait in the gully while</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Kit"--beg pardon, sir--while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieutenant went ahead and had a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. If the trench was unoccupied, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to crawl in and make sure that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast was clear. Then he was to click</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice as a signal for us to follow him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the drain and into the trench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That is--all except me. I was to stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, just inside the wire, as a lookout.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gave the men strict orders to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pistols ready at all times and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">each man to pull the pin of a bomb and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand ready the instant he had cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drain. When they were all in, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to follow Mr. Darrington down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trench until they located Jerry. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred paces or so the last man was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop off and remain behind to act as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, so the main party couldn't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken by surprise from the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the trench was occupied, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't get in through the drain, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scrape his helmet as a signal for us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out along the parapet and give it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them over the top. Well, sir, he had us</seg><seg type="columnLine">go over it a dozen times until each one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us knew precisely what was expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At about 1:30 we started out. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet as death that night and Mr. Dar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rington was quite up the pole about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see, sir, a bit of noise along the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an excellent thing for our little busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. But as luck would have it, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't a sound. I was the last man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line and it seemed to me that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaps up ahead were clumping along like</seg><seg type="columnLine">draught horses. And after we'd gotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty close to Jerry's wire, and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling, the noise was downright hide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps it was just a case of nerves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir, for I don't mind admitting now, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had more than a bit of wind up. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, the stillness was something new to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had a feeling in my bones that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were headed for trouble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT things went along all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and after a time we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the gap and through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire. Mr. Darrington clicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us to stop and, 'pon my word, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that click sounded like a rifle shot. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched in the gully and waited while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went ahead. We could tell when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the drain, for his body blocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the faint circle of light that showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the further end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">102</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay listening in the drain for quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time. Then the light showed again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew he had gotten in all right. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took plenty of time looking around and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was several minutes before he appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the opening again and clicked twice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was the signal for the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to follow him, and one by one they</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled in and disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When the last .man had gotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, I sat and waited. At first all</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still, but after a time I heard some</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering and mumbling and moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">about inside the trench. I knew from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that that the Germans couldn't be any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where about and I don't mind saying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir., that I breathed a lot easier. Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quiet again for a while and I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had gone on down the trench.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But presently I heard two clicks and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Darrington at the further end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drain. I figured that he wanted me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come closer, so I crawled up the gully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he clicked again, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and he went away. Shortly af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter that I could hear them moving on</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the trench toward the second line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I didn't mind waiting, for the worst part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it seemed to be over and 1 had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluded that the Germans, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been on the run for several days, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled a sneak-out on us. This, if I may</seg><seg type="columnLine">say so. sir, was quite satisfactory to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when the hours passed, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to get light. I begau to have mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">givings. I knew that nothing serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have happened to them, for there</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't been so much as a sound, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured that they ought to have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">back by now. I had just begun to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous, when all at once our guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened and dropped a barrage right on</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I tried to crawl up into the drain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I don't know whether I ever got</seg><seg type="columnLine">there or not, for the next thing 1 knew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was in a hospital in Blighty and four</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks had been torn from the calendar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was pretty badly shot up. sir, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't till well after the Armistice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could really get around again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You see, sir, we always removed all</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of identification except our number</seg><seg type="columnLine">tags, when we patrolled, and as mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shot away when I was wounded, no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body knew who I was until I had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained consciousness. I expect that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">why you had so much trouble in trac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But here I am. and those are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts just as I've given them to you. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't blame you for being puzzled, sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whole thing seems downright incred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible. I know that nothing could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to them in the front line, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly I'd have heard the fuss even</seg><seg type="columnLine">had they been attacked in the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. I'm sure, sir, that no matter how</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were caught, they must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot after our barrage started. Other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise I'd have heard it. But how could</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerry have captured all thirteen of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">without starting a fearful rumpus? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Darrington, with no wounds on him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his own pistol by his side--and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I say. sir. it don't seem possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It all looks mighty queer. I know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">every man-jack of them had his pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocked when he entered the drain. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know that every man had a fused</seg><seg type="columnLine">grenade in his right hand a second after</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd entered the trench. How Jerry</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have jumped them is more than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see. Certainly it seems as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would have been hell to pay for at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least a few minutes. And all shot in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Darrington would never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done that. sir. And even had they found</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves hopelessly surrounded, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have done away with them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. They were fighters, those men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">every damned one of them, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite accustomed to having the odds</seg><seg type="columnLine">against them. And you say their puttees</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been removed? What do you make</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that, sir?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I give it up. and I'm sorry I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever came to hear of it. It's set me back</seg><seg type="columnLine">no end. I assure you. Poor Mr. Darring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE KITTEN</seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, such a splendid man! I wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it was that overtook him and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others? I hope, sir, if you ever do solve</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, you'll be kind enough to let me know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the question will plague me to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All shot through the head? My, oh</seg><seg type="columnLine">my! and the 'Kit'--er, Mr. Darring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton--dead, with no wounds, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty gun beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My God, sir, it's enough to drive a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man mad!</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE STORY OF COLONEL T. EVERETT APLIN,</seg><seg type="columnLine">D. S. O.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I SUPPOSE I should have dismissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole thing as just one more grue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some tragedy of the War had it not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the fact that I had known "Darry"</seg><seg type="columnLine">since a child. I went through school</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his father and knew his mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we were both in our teens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a boy, Darry wasn't like his two</seg><seg type="columnLine">older brothers--who were always up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of deviltry--but quiet and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served and just a bit shy. He wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to athletics, though he could sit a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse well enough, and I never dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his becoming a soldier. He just didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem cut out for it. Perhaps it was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisely this fact that drew me to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soldiering is a good enough game for cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain types, but Darry--well, Darry</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed destined for something better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the war sucked in all kinds alike</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when he came out in '16 and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">assigned to my regiment, I wasn't a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased. You see, his being there brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me a responsibility that wasn't quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my line. I knew his folks expected me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep an eye out for him and I also</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that a second lieutenant's chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Somme were rather less than slim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I couldn't show any favoritism, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my only hope was that he'd soon receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of cushy wound that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep him out of it until the war was over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still not handicap his future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were in a comparatively quiet sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor when he joined us and I assigned him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to A Company, to sort of feel him out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He didn't mix very well at first and, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he made no enemies, neither did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he make any friends. From what I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather, he preferred to be alone. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he attended to his duties well enough, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent most of his spare time on his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then his outfit took over the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">line and I heard that he had taken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrolling. How it started, I don't know;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he rapidly developed a morbid liking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for prowling around No Man's Land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One or two men from his platoon were</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn to him by some kindred spirit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wasn't long before he was bringing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits of very valuable information.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a job that the others were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">too willing to turn over to him, for I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that even the bravest men in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack don't particularly relish crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">around between the lines in the dead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. His quiet, nocturnal activities</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather set him apart from the rest and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although the other young officers found</seg><seg type="columnLine">it impossible to warm up to him, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon held in no small respect by every</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of the regiment. During the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was utterly unimpressive, but at night</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took over the whole show.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew that, just before he came out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his first love affair had ended rather sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly and, to him, disastrously; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid he was trying to end matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quickly and quietly as possible. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaps did that, you know. So I called</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to me one day and had a talk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He assured me that my fears were</seg><seg type="columnLine">groundless. He explained that he real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized only too well that he had never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut out for a company officer. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a leader. Standing before his platoon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt embarrassed and out of place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But at night, alone, there were things he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do. He explained that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply trying to make up in one direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for what he lacked in the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From then on, whenever we took over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new sector, he went quietly to work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In no time, he knew every inch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">German wire, the location of their listen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing posts and strong points, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak spots in their defenses. A little</seg><seg type="columnLine">group soon grew up around him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">before long any patrolling required on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our front was turned over to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In time, he came to be rather famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, due to the uncanny quietness with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he left and re-entered our lines, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">became known throughout the regiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">as "The Kitten". At night the men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front line kept one eye cocked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky and, when conditions were fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vorable, they knew very well that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time before dawn "The Kitten" was sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to strike at some point or another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, before the big push in '17, orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to bring in prisoners along the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire front, for the purpose of ascertaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morale, condition, and general timbre</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the troops opposite. Darry knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was planning an extensive raid, and set</seg><seg type="columnLine">about getting the information I needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to carry the thing through suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessfully. Then, two days before the raid</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be sprung, he came to me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the request that he and a few of his fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low ghouls be entrusted with the job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The enemy lines opposite were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongest and most difficult to approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had ever faced. He pointed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that an extensive raid would disclose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming attack, result in serious loss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life to the raiding party and, in all prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability, fail to accomplish it purpose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My plans were so complete and extensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I did not doubt as to the raid's suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess, but I had to admit that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right on the first two counts. I felt sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would fail, for bombing an iso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">la ied post, and bringing back prisoners,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are two very different things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he seemed so set upon it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleaded so earnestly, that I finally gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. Unknown to him, however, I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead with my plans just to be ready in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the event that his attempt proved futile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, gentlemen, it seems that his pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolling activities of the past week had</seg><seg type="columnLine">put Jerry wise. At any rate, they kneAv</seg><seg type="columnLine">something was up and were on the look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. They must have received word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our plans, and were expecting a much</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger raid. How he got into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">trenches. I don't know, but seeing only</seg><seg type="columnLine">four men, they let him come. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have known that the real raid</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scheduled for the next night and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">figuring that this was just another prow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling party, they were reluctant to waste,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on three or four men. the splendid am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush they had planned. It was precise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly this that saved him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they underestimated "The Kit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten", and when they did decide to quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather him in, they found they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck a Tartar. When they jumped him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was up forward listening and roundly</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing myself for having allowed him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go. It was all over in a second. A dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">grenades or so, a few pistol shots, one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two yells, and then--silence! No rockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">went up, no barrage came over; whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened, had happened quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I waited around for half an hour and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then went back to my P. C. I had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt quite so low, and the look* in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of the men that I passed as I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way down the trench seemed to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demn me. It was the first time that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized what a place Darry held in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts. I entered the P. C. sick all over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and just on the verge of a blue funk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I hadn't had time to toss aside my</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet, when there was a commotion</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside. I rushed out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down the trench, with two of his men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came "The Kitten": and behind them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an excited, whispering mob that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to include the entire regiment. Darry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one of his men had been wounded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the unwouuded one was carrying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth man, and in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group was a German sergeant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fourth man was found to be dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the Germans never had the pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of burying him. Darry and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">others had seen to that. They had fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE KITTEN</seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg><seg type="columnLine">their attackers off, broken contact, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneaked back to our lines with a pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner and their dead companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few minutes later, Darry went back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the hospital knowing full well that I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon have an M. C. coming down to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE German sergeant was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon induced to talk. You may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure that I listened to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">story with profound interest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seems that they were fully aware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our plans for the next night, and well</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to meet them. If what he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me was the truth, we wouldn't have stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ghost of a chance. The raiding party</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been annihilated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Darry's wound healed quickly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was back in ten days and going right at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it again. He was more than a hero now!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a legend! Every man along that</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire section of the front knew about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kitten of the King's Royal Rifles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the disasters of the Spring of '18,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we took hold again and fought our way</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to our old positions. Jerry was</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling the strain and by summer we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had broken through his lines and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trench warfare had given way to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement. This suited Darry perfectly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I got him a pip and put him in charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the regimental scout platoon with or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders to do as he saw fit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, gentlemen, the job had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made for him, and he found himself right</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his element. In no time he had mold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed his little force into the deadliest night</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting-machine on the Western Front.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He and his handful of men ranged up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down the enemy lines dealing death</seg><seg type="columnLine">and destruction nearly every night. Calls</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his services came from every com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany in the regiment. 1 take my oath</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it seemed to me that he was beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the German Army single-handed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Due to his activities, our line was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways out ahead. Our attacks went fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther and our losses were fewer. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how many machine-guns he put</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of action the night before our at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacks, but I do know, that time and time</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, when the King's Royals went for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward next morning, they found the guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been holding them up were</seg><seg type="columnLine">manned only by the dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We pushed ahead until August, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we ran up against a nasty little system</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trenches that succeeded in stopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">our advance. The lines on our right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left were still going forward and I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the trench position couldn't hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">out long without taking the risk of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded. But we were a proud and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocky outfit, and not accustomed to lag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging behind the rest of the line, so I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided not to wait, and ordered a stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrage and concentrated attack for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning of August 10th.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew nothing of Darry's plan. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, I certainly would have stopped it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was gallant and courageous, but fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardy and unnecessary nevertheless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Normally I would have been advised of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. but we were going hammer and tongs</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the time, and I frankly admit that T</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't always know just what Darry was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I'll never forget that night! Mail</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up just before we went over, and f</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a moment off to rest my nerves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">read a note from Darry's father. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't heard from Darry for some weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was worried. He hoped I'd be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get word to his son that the girl back</seg><seg type="columnLine">home had changed her mind and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready, whenever Darry was, to announce</seg><seg type="columnLine">their engagement. Perhaps the M. C.</seg><seg type="columnLine">had something to do with that. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a far more important engage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment for me to think about just then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, for a moment, I forgot it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't until the next evening that</seg><seg type="columnLine">word came to me of Darry's death. 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">had long since learned to take the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the death of a lifelong friend as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter to be regretted, but expected. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was different. Darry--the Kitten--</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't just a man; wasn't just a friend!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was the regiment!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an unspeakable disaster! Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">106</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">course we went right on. But it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same. The dash and spirit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were gone. They did their hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">work doggedly and well, but without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old-time zest and pride. The focal point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nucleus of the regiment's interest--</seg><seg type="columnLine">from myself to the newest recruit--had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly ceased to exist!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kitten and his quiet midnight</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderers were no longer with us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stripped of their equipment and shot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face! And what of Darry? With</seg><seg type="columnLine">his empty pistol in his hand and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark on his boyish body!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as the days went by and the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery of his death remained unsolved, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sadness of the men's loss changed into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">maniacal resentment. The regiment rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an overwhelming lust for revenge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I feel sure that, in the days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights that followed, many a weary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic-stricken German met his death on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point of a bayonet, instead of loafing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a prison pen, as he might have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">had Darrv lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When things quieted down a bit, I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I could to ascertain the facts. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have read the report that my inquiries</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought forth. Time added nothing to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It only confirmed the tales of the men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and added to the mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the question never quite left my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, and later--much later--when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war was over and I was back in mufti</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, I sought to find out w'hat had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become of the missing thirteenth man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, I found him, and you have heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">his story. Make what you will of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It helped me not at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now there seems to be no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail to follow. I have listened to many</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanations, but, knowing Darry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men as I did. none of them seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite plausible. So, I suppose, we'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let it rest as just one of the many un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved mysteries of the War. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would certainly like to know just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">did happen. Twelve men shot in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and Darry dead, with no wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him, and his empty pistol by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. God Almighty!</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE STORY OF AUGUST SCHMITT</seg><seg type="columnLine">Formerly Corporal in the Prussian</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guards, "The Kaiser's Own"</seg><seg type="columnLine">TT WAS in July that the luck started to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> turn against us. By August the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture had changed. We were up against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the English, and a crack regiment at that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This outfit had developed a method of</seg><seg type="columnLine">night raiding that had been playing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil with our morale. They struck like</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning and gave us no peace. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our younger troops had gone yellow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even the old-timers were jumpy when</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were in trenches on a hill. Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">trenches and good wire. I was on watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the front line. It was dark and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't see so well because the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloped down from our trench. So I slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">out over the top and lay in the grass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A drain went out under our parapet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a gully that ran down to our wire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About nine o'clock, I heard a faint click</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was it? I wondered. Maybe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strand of wire slipped. Maybe some poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded fellow is trying to get back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lines. But I watch to make sure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no moon, but the stars were</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Then I see a shadow. It is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gully just inside the wire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watch. After some time, the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">moves. It moves closer to me, up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gully. I put my sights upon it. No use</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking any chances. It keeps coming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon I can make it out. It is a man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He is below me now, where the gully is</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep. This is no wounded comrade. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">is an Englishman, and very likely one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accursed night murderers we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been trying to bag for so long. I press</seg><seg type="columnLine">my trigger slowly. His time has come!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I hear two more clicks further</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. It is a signal. I must be very</seg><seg type="columnLine">wary. Perhaps there are others. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE KITTEN</seg><seg type="columnLine">107</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an exposed position and one grenade</seg><seg type="columnLine">would finish me. I release the pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the trigger and wait. Another shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes forward. It joins the first. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay peering at the drain that runs into</seg><seg type="columnLine">our trench. Another click! They start</seg><seg type="columnLine">to slide back. I press the trigger again!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But something tells me no!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A better plan forms in my head. Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say to myself, is where I get a sergeant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">job! To kill one of these raiders would</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly be something. But to catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">them alive would be more. So I lay low.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They slide away noiselessly. Good thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came out here. From the fire step I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have seen nothing. They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have returned later on and snuffed us</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in precisely the same way they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done so many times before. I give them</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of time to get away. Then I slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the trench and spread the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These fellows. I tell my comrades, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">just looking the ground over. And they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clever--believe me!--as quiet as</seg><seg type="columnLine">cats. They will come again, probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">four or five of them. I know their sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nals. Two clicks--advance! One click</seg><seg type="columnLine">--retreat! Our sergeant is excited and</seg><seg type="columnLine">is all for lining up out in the grass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting them when they come into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gully. Bah! This would be foolish!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shoot at them and get killed by the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swering shower of grenades. In the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">he listens to reason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are fourteen of us. Quickly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell them my scheme. I will wait outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parapet until they return. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will slide back and give the warning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond doubt they will try to enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the drain if they think that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trench is unoccupied. To do this, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have to enter one by one. We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">line up on each side of the entrance and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they come in, we will clip them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the head with a--well, it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">not make a noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My brain is working fast. I have an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea. I wrap my heavy trench knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my first aid bandage. That will do</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trick. A sharp blow hardly makes a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. After we clip the first one we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will take him by the arms and pull him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in to one side and pass him along. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have no equipment other than his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol and grenades, for otherwise he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not get through the drain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pistol is the thing to look out for.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It must be grabbed at the very instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the blow is delivered. If the blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a good one, the pistol will not fire. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flexes do not contract--they relax--from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blow at the base of the brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At each end of the bay, we will post a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with many grenades. If anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes wrong, these men will throw rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the gully. We should bag the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, at any rate, and then, if necessary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can meet the others with their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons. Perhaps we can bag more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They agree to my plan. We take po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitions and rehearse. We will not need</seg><seg type="columnLine">any help. We will tell no one. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">might get jumpy and give away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">show. This is our own little party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon we are ready, and I climb out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my post. But not quite so far as before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just far enough so I can see the gully</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it is shallow by the wire. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">damp and cold and I have to fight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep awake. I wait for hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is absolutely quiet. I have not seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">it this way since 1914. I close my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest them. One cannot stare forever</seg><seg type="columnLine">without going blind. I open them again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last! My blood boils and I stiffen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A shadow is in the gully just inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire. The shadow moves. That is enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me. I slide back and give the alarm!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly every man becomes tense. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is quiet as death. We wait nervously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps they have heard me enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trench and have been scared away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But no! There is a click! Faint, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmistakable. The stop signal! We wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. How long! God knows! Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">second is an hour! Then faint scrapings</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from the drain. There is a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it. He is coming nearer. More scrap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--very faint, very cautious. Now his</seg><seg type="columnLine">108</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">head cannot be more than a foot inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drain. He waits. We wait. Then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrape and all at once his head and shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders appear. Four hands move swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there is a dull thud. Not loud, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">--well, drop an orange on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slumps. His helmet is in Paul's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand and both wrists are caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a vise. On the other side, Strumpf</seg><seg type="columnLine">has the fellow's revolver and is quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting down his muffled trench knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a heave. Slowly, deliberately, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull him in and deposit him in the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. The last man on the line gags him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stands by, ready to deliver another</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow if necessary. The next two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">step up to the drain. We wait and wait,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no more follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Himmell I am a fool! Of course the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others are waiting to find out if all is</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. I exchange the Englishman's hel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">met for my own and show myself at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the drain. Then I click twice--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my finger nails, and step back. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetches them! They come. Louder this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. They think the trench is empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that there is nothing to fear. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">so happy, I could shout! No matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happens now, I shall get my pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, to make a long story short, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were thirteen of them all told. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought they would never stop coming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But everything went like clockwork, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though we never expected so many. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">place was crowded, let me tell you. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were sure they were all in, we didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what to do with them. Some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were coming to life, so we bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gagged each one. It was a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that they wore those long wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">puttees or we would have run out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tying material.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a thought struck me. What if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have left a lookout outside? Might</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well try for him, too. I still have on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the English helmet, so I go to the drain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and click twice. I wait, but no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes. I click again, but nothing hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens. They have not left a lookout.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good! And now we must not delay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of the men are so bitter that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to kill them on the spot. I hush</seg><seg type="columnLine">them abruptly. We must carry them</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the commander's dugout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They agree. Each man shoulders a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner and we stagger to the rear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT our luck has been too</seg><seg type="columnLine">good. It can not last! Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it deserts us entirely. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the support line, a lieu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenant with many troops comes rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. There is an enemy attack coming!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every man to his post! There is not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute to lose. This is no time for pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oners! The lieutenant orders us to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in the second line bay and post a</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard! It is an outrage. I protest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up!" he yells at me. "Obey or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders! Every man to his post!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how will we get them back?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">demand!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you care? Kill the dogs if</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary! God knows they have killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of us. We may all be prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves if we don't step lively."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My heart sinks. The guts seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drain out of me. Am I to be cheated out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my glory? Scattered shelling begins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lights go up. My comrades drop the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners and rush back to the front line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stay where I am. It is a sinful shame</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all this night's work should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted. I could cry with rage and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment. But it is getting light. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">see one of my prisoners is an officer. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouch beside him. He is dead. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first blow was harder than necessary. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse! Death is far too good for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rip off his bonds and search him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not a bad looking fellow, but not of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soldier type. Certainly not the kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would expect to find on a job like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. I quickly inspect the others. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral seem to be dead also. Perhaps only</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious. Some are awake and glar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at me with hateful eyes. My brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">reels! I know how they feel! I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with hatred and loathing for them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TIIE KITTEN</seg><seg type="columnLine">109</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many of my comrades have been killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by these men--struck down in the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no chance to defend themselves!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shelling is getting worse. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous and unstrung. The world is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedlam around me. I work feverishly!</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of them is a sergeant! What a haul!</seg><seg type="columnLine">One officer, one sergeant, and eleven men!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And all for nothing! Ach, Gotti</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the strain is getting the best of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me? The shells are coming closer. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling with fear and excitement!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the world splits open and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">English barrage is upon me. Not exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on me, but on the front line. It is a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrage. Terrible! In a few moments 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be blown to pieces! What can T do!</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 must leave them or be killed.

Tt is</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless. Some of their eyes are alive, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies are dead! Paralyzed! I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing hysterically.

Under this bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage. those who arc not killed will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to retreat. Some of these prisoners may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be rescued alive. It must not be! They</seg><seg type="columnLine">must not live to kill again! The lieuten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant has said to shoot them, if necessary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now, there is no other way for it! Tt is</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to me! But this is not me! This man</seg><seg type="columnLine">is crazy! My muscles act as if guided</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some outside force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I take out my pistol. It shakes in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stagger about and shoot them, one by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Soon my magazine is empty. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pocket is one of their pistols.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him eloquent, facing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers, Rezin P. Bowie and John J.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowie. All three had carved their lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle plantation out of virgin forest there</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Bayou Boeuf in Rapides Parish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louisiana. They had made some money</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of their cotton crops. Jim had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">away on a business trip down-river to</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Orleans. Now he was revealing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rezin and John that he had been to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jean Lafitte at Galveston Island. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was arguing that they pool the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had made on white cotton and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunge on black ivory--illegal Negro</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves out of Africa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The three brothers had come up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hard school of the frontier. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">their father, Rezin Bowie, married their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother, Elvira Jones Bowie, in Burke</seg><seg type="columnLine">County, Georgia, the family had moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">every time a neighbor's cabin got near</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough so they could see his chimney-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick, unruly shock of sandy hair topped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tall figure. His eyes were deep-set,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray, arresting.

But young Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowie had studied the law and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loophole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Under the law, when an informer</seg><seg type="columnLine">"tipped off" the customs man and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave cargo was seized, the slaves were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sold at public auction.

But more important yet, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves became legal property inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States. They could be transport-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, bought, sold. Galveston Island was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a short hop from the Louisiana</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast.

Load-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it with slaves at Galveston Island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would land it secretly on the Louis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iana coast. They would go to the near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est customs men and "inform on them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves." They had found an "owner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less abandoned slave cargo." At the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suing auction, a dummy would bid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slaves for them. The three husky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowie brothers woidd circulate among</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible bidders, and make it a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal and unhealthy affair for any man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who tried to outbid them. They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">get half their own money back as in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formers. Then they would sell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves on their slave-hungry plantations</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the bayous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jim Bowie in command, the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers plunged on black ivory.

He found Ra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pides feverish with land speculation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Land-hungry immigrants were pouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. Louisiana cotton and sugar meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift wealth. Newlv-organized banks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lavish with loans.

Thomas Jefferson Wells, Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral Montfort Wells, Samuel Levi Wells</seg><seg type="columnLine">and James Madison Wells, four wealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers, planters in the Bayou Boeuf</seg><seg type="columnLine">section, were Old-Timers. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">close friends of Jim Bowie. In that day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">your friends' enemies were your enemies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">politically and personally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> William Fristoe, the Old-Timer sher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iff of Rapides, died in office in 1823.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The New-Comers, by some sharp po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">litical maneuvering, got young Major</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norris Wright appointed to fill the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expired term. In 1826 they managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">elect him sheriff. Jim Bowie had cam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paigned hotly against him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norris Wright was slim, pale, frail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he needed no pity. He was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadliest pistol-shot in Rapides. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage and coolness under fire were ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solute. He had fought five duels, killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his man in two of them. He came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baltimore to Alexandria, worked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">clerk in the general merchandise store</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Martin &amp; Bryant. He helped organize</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new bank in Alexandria, was elected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its board of directors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bad luck hit Jim Bowie. Several bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">crop years came in swift succession. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floods overflowed his lands. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced the fact that he must borrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">more money or lose his fortune. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the Alexandria bank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">applied for a loan. A few days later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his incredulous wrath, he was told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loan had been refused. He corked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger, made quiet inquiries. He learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the directors had been willing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to grant the loan, but Norris Wright</seg><seg type="columnLine">had argued his fellow-directors into vot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They met on an Alexandria street a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days later. Wright pulled his pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol. Jim Bowie rushed without drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon. Wright fired.

But a second later</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowie's big hands had closed on Wright.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim tore the pistol from the sheriff's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and hurled it far. Then, systematic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, he set about killing Wright with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bare hands. He had pounded him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into unconsciousness and was choking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to death when bystanders rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and pulled them apart. All Rapides</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew now it was only a matter of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">before one killed the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CURIOUS characters took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage before that time came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One was Colonel Robert A.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crain. He came from Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginia to Alexandria. From Dr. John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rippy he rented a plantation on Bayou</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rapides. He ran up bills. When cred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itors came to collect, he challenged them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to duels "for insulting a Virginia gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man." Dr. Rippy came to collect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent. Colonel Crain offered his note.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Rippy said he preferred cash. Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onel Crain shot and killed him "for in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulting a Virginia gentleman." Colonel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crain had allied himself politically with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheriff Wright and the New-Comers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was never arrested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Levin Luckett complained to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rapides grand jury that Colonel Crain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken some of Luckett's Negro</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves outside the state of Louisiana.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was serious. The grand jury in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicted Colonel Crain. Before the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to trial, Luckett rode into Alex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">andria and asked the district attorney</seg><seg type="columnLine">to withdraw the charge. He had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">married Colonel Crain's daughter, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained; he didn't want to prosecute</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father-in-law. The district attorney</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he had no legal right to quash the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case. Sheriff Wright was a political</seg><seg type="columnLine">power in the state capitol now. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louisiana Legislature passed a bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">granting the district attorney of Rapides</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right to quash the case against Colo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel Crain.

A few days</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, General Montfort Wells, a shot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun on his arm, met Dr. Maddox on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">public road in Alexandria, and without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word opened fire.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found popular sentiment there</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him. Stung to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick, he sold his last acre and slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went to Texas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He prospered at first.

Tuberculosis attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his giant frame. He sought excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere, lashed his ravaged body 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">with whisky. When the Texans rose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebellion against Mexico under General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Houston, he joined them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Side by side with Buck Travis he</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped defend the Alamo. Helping</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount a cannon 011 a platform inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls, he slipped, fell, was hurt bad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. Then an icy "norther" smote the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred eighty-one Texans who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were holding four thousand Mexicans at</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay. Jim Bowie went down with pneu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They propped him up on his cot that</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning of March 6, 1836, when General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, raging</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he had been held at bay since</seg><seg type="columnLine">February 23 by this handful of men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled his full force at the Alamo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls.

His characters are</seg><seg type="columnLine">motivated by the same deep and funda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental emotions that motivate all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people we know. When Tros gets mad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it isn't for some mystic or involved his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torical reason--anybody, then or now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get hot about the collar. The fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Tros wears no collar, and the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us do, makes no difference at all. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't occur to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, the conversation is natural. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of historical stories come to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine, and most of them make you</seg><seg type="columnLine">pant for air in a cloud of mummy dust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Prithee!" say all the popinjays, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">writer tangles you in ruffles, trips you</seg><seg type="columnLine">over harquebuses, confounds and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuses you with halidoms and bodkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">until a poor reader, who is just an inno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent fellow trying to follow a story, col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapses with a clank upon the rivets in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower backplate while the contents of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">museum are being dumped upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dented capeline and all the macaronis</seg><seg type="columnLine">are saying in chorus "Fie! Fie!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We have to put a pox and postage</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a good many historical stories be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause only historians could understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">T WONDER how many people who read his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory for fun (which is the only way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read) have noticed the, so to speak, spiritual</seg><seg type="columnLine">resemblance between Cleopatra and Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth of England. There are some imagin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Camp-Fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where readers, writers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventurers meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">ative students of history who maintain, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good deal of logical argument, that Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elisabeth may have been a reincarnation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cleopatra. That may be sense or nonsense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it is at least an interesting theory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have imagined Tros as a sort of spiritual</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancestor of Sir Francis Drake, who could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly have got away for his famous voyage</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the world without the queen's knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, consent and assistance. Like Elizabeth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cleopatra was determined to hold her throne</seg><seg type="columnLine">against all comers, at anyone's expense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cleopatra finds it fairly easy to delay Tros'</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure, by compelling him to do Herculean</seg><seg type="columnLine">chores. Her own job was so difficult that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had plenty of excuse for, as Tros describes it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat-and-mousing him. She was too clever, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wise enough to deal with him straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forwardly. Her character is changing very</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, now that she is maturing and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer has Caesar to direct her policy. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">she needs is a man. Her whole reign is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of a woman's need for a man to supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">the qualities which she lacks. Given the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to lead her armies, she might have be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come the greatest ruler the world has ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. A naturally gay and high-spirited</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, well aware of her genius and of the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance of sex in a world of warriors, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly aware that Rome intends to grab</seg><seg type="columnLine">Egypt at the first opportunity, she changes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of her natural charm into a treacherous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cynically ruthless despot. That Tros won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">even pretend to love her, mortifies her. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">he loves her sister, enrages her. But she is</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical. Since he won't be her lover, he shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">be her unofficial agent, whether he likes it or</seg><seg type="columnLine">not. I imagine that not less than ninety per</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent of the scandalous tales about Cleopatra,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they were not the pure inventions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scandal-mongers, were based on her efforts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a man fit to share her throne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following random notes may be of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest. The shipwrights of Rhakotis, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the western quarter of the city of Alex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">andria, turned out excellent vessels built of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cedar imported from Lebanon. Their skill was</seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg><seg type="columnLine">118</seg><seg type="columnLine">ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed by the demand for ships that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry huge cargoes of corn.--The Jewish resi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dential quarter was at the eastern end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city, but they were not forbidden to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">business elsewhere, and most of the big fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tories and warehouses had fallen into Jewish</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.--The Egyptian government of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day had a very highly developed banking sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem, but private hoards of gold, of any con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable quantity, were kept in the temples,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they were safe enough except from in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vasion by an alien army. The Jews, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Alexandria, and all through the Levant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">conducted a very efficient banking system of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ancient world thoroughly despised</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors, who were treated more or less as</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals, and behaved themselves accordingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">War crews were marines, that is to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers detailed for duty at sea; they, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despised the real seamen. I have imagined</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tros as having different ideas about it.--</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was probably no port in the world at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time, excepting Alexandria, where Tros</seg><seg type="columnLine">had friends and money, where he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">put in for repairs to his trireme without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">plundered. Piracy was a major industry, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">governments were just as bad pirates as any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else. His trireme would certainly have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been seized at any Roman port. Pigeon post</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very highly developed. News traveled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">that means, from temple to temple, at great</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. This gave the priests a political value</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they might have found otherwise hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sustain.--Most historians of the period seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have overlooked the importance of Cassius</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Near East. Anthony, Octavian and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lepidus shelved their mutual hatred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the triumvirate in Rome simply and</seg><seg type="columnLine">solely because Cassius held a key-position in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syria and was likely to become strong enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to defeat all three of them. Had Cassius, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of Caesar's murderers, been a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caesar's genius and guts, he could easily have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized Egypt after he became proconsul in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syria, and with all that enormous wealth at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his disposal he could almost certainly have</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeated Antony and Octavian. But Cassius</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a piker. He wasted his time raping Syria</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Palestine, imposing impossible taxes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying, through spies and agents, to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in Egypt that would give him an</seg><seg type="columnLine">excuse to invade. Cleopatra, who couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly have resisted an invasion by even</seg><seg type="columnLine">live or six Roman legions, was too clever for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and much too wise to trust her own cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupt and mercenary army.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buying cheap slaves, putting them to school,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and selling them as expert accountants, but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lers, dancers, acrobats, actors, prostitutes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so forth, was one of the most profitable in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dustries of the period.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> India was an almost unknown country, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trade with India had already assumed im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance, weapons of war from Alexandria be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing- the principal goods sent in exchange for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian silks and spices. India was a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">market, too, for Cleopatra's emeralds, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a royal monopoly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a country as highly organized but weakly</seg><seg type="columnLine">militarized as Egypt, the system of holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostages was all-important. The Greek upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">classes of such cities as Heliopolis and Mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phis, who were savagely taxed and exasper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated by all sorts of impositions, were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained from too much treason, and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether from rebellion, by the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sons and daughters were at court, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had to be extravagantly supported by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their parents. Their lives would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly forfeited if their parents had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in rebellion. Patriotism, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">nationalism, had not yet been invented, hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">family ties were immensely strong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very little is actually known about Char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mion, beyond that she and Iras are said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have died with the queen. Iras, who may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the queen's hairdresser, was a Persian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Charmion was a Greek, and perhaps a</seg><seg type="columnLine">virgin. I have imagined her as in love with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tros, and more bitter against him for re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusing to love the queen than for rejecting her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own acidulous embraces. Charmion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably a pious aristocrat--perhaps a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Alexandrine D.A.R. developing into a man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hater and a very zealous spy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the Greek Alexandrine, Egypt was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of dark mystery from which he drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenues. Even Cleopatra, spirited adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turess though she was, during all her reign</seg><seg type="columnLine">is only known to have made one journey up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Nile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I invented Boidion. There is absolutely no</seg><seg type="columnLine">historical proof of the existence of any such</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. But royal bastards were as frequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">as almost any other royal indiscretion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were numbers of pretenders to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne of Egypt, most of whom came to a vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent end after feeble efforts to gain a follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I may have actually "invented" a "real"</seg><seg type="columnLine">character.

O. Greenleaf of San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jose, Calif. This article, or letter, was so very</seg><seg type="columnLine">far wrong that I felt called upon to correct it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chinchillas (genuine South American) can,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arc, being raised profitably in captivity--</seg><seg type="columnLine">right here in California. I might add that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the only place outside of South America</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are being raised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In 1928 a law was passed in Chile for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidding trapping chinchillas for pelts or ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port. This law was passed covering a period</seg><seg type="columnLine">of five years and has been extended for</seg><seg type="columnLine">another period of five years. There have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed similar laws in Peru and Bolivia since</seg><seg type="columnLine">1928. This information was given me by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the American Consul Generals located in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the above mentioned countries. I was also</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed that the animals cost $1,000.00 each</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured alive--price may be slightly higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">in case of a particularly desirable specimen. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote other countries in South America but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was informed that chinchillas were to be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in the above named countries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Contrary to Mr. Young's reply--chinchilla</seg><seg type="columnLine">fur has very long hair, measuring from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to two inches in length. The skin is not tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">--in fact, it is less tough and durable than</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit fur, and is so rated by furriers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair is unbelievably fine, and grows in little</seg><seg type="columnLine">tufts similar to a milkweed tassel where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">joins the skin. This peculiar fact and the fine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the individual hairs accounts for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter impossibility of successfully imitating</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuine chinchilla fur. This fur ranges in</seg><seg type="columnLine">color from a light slate-gray to a dark blue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray. The latter is worth more. I have quota-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions from several leading fur houses of from</seg><seg type="columnLine">$5 to $250 a pelt. I should say that the aver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age price for prime chinchilla would be in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighborhood of $200.00. Chinchillas raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">here in the U.S. are not. as yet, being pelted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and placed on the open market. The entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">output at present is more or less destined for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sale as breeding animals. The price for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">proven pair of breeders is $3,200.00.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chinchillas are of about the same size as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large gray squirrel and are members of the ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent family. They are found above the 12,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot level in the Andes. It takes time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience to acclimatize them to sea-level at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere. The man who originally brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to this country started with 6 pairs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally arrived with 4 females and 3 males,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which formed the nucleus of the present herd</seg><seg type="columnLine">of more than 500 chinchillas. I might also</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that there would have been many more</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not 36 of the best of the flock been stolen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1929 and taken out of the country. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of this group of 36 animals is alive today.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These animals breed as often as three times a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year. They are entirely vermin-free--in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vermin just can't seem to get off fast enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">when placed in chinchilla fur. I imagine this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is partially on account of the extreme fine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the hair.

And I am sorry I cannot, offhand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer all your questions. I have not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">printed data here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hudson Stuck published his book in 1914,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you probably know, and Belmore Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">the year earlier. The mountain was climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of years ago, you may remember,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a very expert and efficient manner, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget the names of the men. I have no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the mountain has been climbed, the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">peak or the other, by a number of parties</seg><seg type="columnLine">since Hudson Stuck's time. While it is some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what of a feat to succeed, the fact that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ASK ADVENTURE</seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg><seg type="columnLine">publicity may have been given to such ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peditions can reasonably be attributed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dislike of many climbers to such publicity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strong, active men who are experienced in</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow and ice travel and are patient and intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent can climb practically any mountain. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">very higli altitudes, however, it is, as you say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an almost purely physiological problem. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">the above qualities yield in importance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">idiosyncrasy--the possession of a singularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">well fitted heart, lung, and other organic</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment.
