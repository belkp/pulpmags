scratch the bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the ear, calling to us that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk about bulls being vicious was all a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fake Then he started to walk away</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he bent over to pick up his gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something happened, and Humpy

type="columnLine"> Humpy never had much to say about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the innate gentleness of the bull race</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereafter, and he remarked, after he had</seg><seg

pipes' is connected to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupling for supplying steam from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiler Steam is thus admitted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinders, and the pistons are set in mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, thereby forcing their toothed projec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions against the teeth of the track and</seg><seg

would</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear that the Central Pacific reconstruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion across Great Salt Lake had equally in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind the doing of the same amount of work</seg><seg type="columnLine">as before, in the same time, but with less</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort For instance, a comparison of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">and new time-tables will show that train</seg><seg type="columnLine">No 3 saves one hour and fifty-five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">by crossing Great Salt Lake, but it only</seg><seg type="columnLine">saves twelve minutes in the through run to</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Francisco, showing that it loses one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour and forty-three minutes 011 the far end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the line</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Train No 5 saves an hour by crossing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake direct, but loses one hour and three</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes 011 the far end of the route, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the net result is a loss of three minutes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Train No 1 has really been quickened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some extent It gains two hours and fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes by- crossing the lake, and also gains</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-two minutes at the far end of the trip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the total saving is two
