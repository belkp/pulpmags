            <seg type="columnLine">not so valuable as imitation silk stockings or cartons of cigarettes.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Most ingenious was the removal of an Illinois Central carload of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">When no one was looking, he pried up tacks and removed an "empty" card from one</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">posure made still longer. Here, then, are</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a few simple rules to observe:</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> (1) Get your engine straight in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">finder; make sure it isn't tipped to one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">side. A good way to do this is to notice</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">see to it that they are parallel with the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> (2) Focus properly, if your camera has</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a focusing rack; and "stop down," if it is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">equipped with a stopping device. "Stop-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ping down" is closing of the "eye" of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">camera so that the opening is smaller and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">less light enters. This, of course, means</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">longer exposure, but sharper negatives.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> (3) Give plenty of exposure, especially</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if you "stop down." Try to take your</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">engine pictures on a sunny day, and even</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then give them more time than you would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ordinary subjects. If necessary, buy or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make a tripod or camera stand, so that if</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">you have to you can take exposures of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">more than 1/25 second (never give more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if you are holding the camera) after you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have stopped down. A little experimenting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">will soon enable you to determine when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">you have enough exposure.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> (4) Try to develop your own negatives</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and print your own pictures. If you can't</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">do the former, at least print your own.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Once you get the hang of it--and anybody</seg>
