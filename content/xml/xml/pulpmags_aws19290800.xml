He had caught the carefully modulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech of this day and was striving to soften the harsh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasant tones that was peculiar to his own time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do they classify one?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are expecting orders to go out on a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous mission, but while we are waiting we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">become acquainted. During the centuries since you</seg><seg type="columnLine">labored as an inventor, science has practically sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted superstition. Denominational religion, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it, has disappeared and science has taken its</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Our mathematicians have extended their</seg><seg type="columnLine">theorems into the seventh dimension which we believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be the highest in the particular universe in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we exist. The control of people through fear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown has given way to the power of knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it is through knowledge that science is now striv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to control the behavior of people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even during the middle ages, the Steel Age, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">call it, scientists discovered that the human body is</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by an aura and that the condition of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">aura reflects the state of health enjoyed by the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual. Through the use of better filters and highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed photography we have gone farther and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the color and other characteristics of the aura give</seg><seg type="columnLine">us an index to the mental and moral development of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the person. By studying the colored photograph of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aura we can determine with reasonable certainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reaction the individual will exhibit to any ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">stimulus. Before elections the aura photographs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">candidates are circulated and the people can then judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">for themselves who are best fitted for office. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">our purpose to place only high-minded men in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">position of trust whether public or private. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">with criminal tendencies are suppressed and kept where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they cannot do any serious harm. We have succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in weeding unworthy men out of office, until now</seg><seg type="columnLine">corruption among government and corporation officials</seg><seg type="columnLine">is practically unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now you will understand why we were careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">in answering your questions until we had your classi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fication papers. You will notice that in the picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your aura a clear blue predominates. That indicates</seg><seg type="columnLine">a marvelous mental development. This fringe of bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold indicates a fine moral and spiritual ^development.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the other hand, an aura that is roily, such as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick red, dirty brown or gray, belongs to the type we</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppress. In extreme cases it may be a smudge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You probably wonder at the color of the clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were issued to you upon your classification.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will observe that your clothes are of the same color</seg><seg type="columnLine">as your aura, that all may see to what state of develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment you have attained. This is a great factor in</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamping out deceit and crime, for it is now impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a 'wolf to stalk in sheep's clothing', as it were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course, when the system was first inaugurated a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few tried to wear false colors but were apprehended</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">almost immediately and, needless to say, never repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">their duplicity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand."

The face disappeared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen was filled with the image of a sheet of blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper covered with typewritten words. The adjutant</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched a button and the image faded away. Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly the lights were turned on and the adjutant</seg><seg type="columnLine">lianded to the captain a photographic film which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken from a compartment in the wall opposite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">television screen. Addison, following the lieutenant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">example, looked over the captain's shoulders while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he read from an exact facsimile of the image that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared on the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  While Addison wondered at this total lack of military</seg><seg type="columnLine">discipline, the captain finished reading and said quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Action orders. To stations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Addison hesitated, "May I go?" he asked uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely, although I warn you that our mission is</seg><seg type="columnLine">very dangerous. You must assume all responsibility for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your presence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a simple "Yes", Addison followed the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men through several large rooms where men were at</seg><seg type="columnLine">work before machines. He marvelled at the lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I noticed that everything is so silent and swift and</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficient," he said to the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes", the officer fell in step with Addison. "Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the Steel Age the people were beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaw noise. We find it unnecessary, and abhor any</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise or harsh voices."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Addison stopped. He had been so in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested in his questions that he had not noticed that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although they were underground and that it was night</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, the rooms were lighted as though by sunlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and further that there were no shadows. In fact, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light seemed to come from all directions, but was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenly distributed that it did not hurt his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you illuminate the place?" he asked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall explain when we are aboard the ship," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain smiled. We have orders to depart immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">so cannot stop now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They left the factory rooms and after walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a wide corridor emerged in a huge cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SILENT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where rested a row of torpedo-like ships, each some</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred feet in length and fifty feet in diameter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Addison, with his characteristic eye for details, counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty of the metallic, sky-blue shapes. Here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">crews of men worked silently about the monsters that</seg><seg type="columnLine">towered high above them. The captain touched a but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton and there sounded in the silence of the vast cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faint musical tinkle of a bell. The sound was fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by two short rings and Addison was amazed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">awed to see one of the huge monsters rise slightly and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a sinister phantom, drift slowly and soundlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a great door into another room where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled gently upon bunks built on the floor. His scalp</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightened as he watched this graceful display of pon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derous and terrible forces. With the two officers, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed the ship and the door closed silently behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They walked toward the center of the towering</seg><seg type="columnLine">form where a door opened and a flight of steps slid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch the roof," said the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light grew dim and Addison was astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">and terrified to see the roof of the cavern settle down</seg><seg type="columnLine">for perhaps a hundred feet and then split through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center, but the lights were extinguished and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see no more until an opening appeared the length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ceiling and the stars shone through. Silently, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parting of drifting clouds, the roof opened until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire ceiling was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A section of the woods is lowered, trees and all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slid aside to let us out," the captain explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come, we must get aboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They climbed up the stairs into a small, dimly-lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">room where the captain closed a switch and the stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose soundlessly, disappearing between the walls. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door closed behind them. But no sooner had the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut, than the room burst into the usual daylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliance. Addison felt the sensation of rising in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevator and turned to the captain with a question on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said the officer, "this is an elevator. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are going to the third floor where the control room is</seg><seg type="columnLine">located."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            A Silent Flight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY stepped from the elevator into a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor and then to a large, well-appointed room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where several officers sat at desks, one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking slowly and distinctly into microphones</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped to his chest. Others were operating tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision sets and radio apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To whom is that officer telephoning?", inquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">Addison after carefully surveying the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He isn't," Lieutenant Evenrude answered. "He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stenographer. He speaks into the microphones and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice operates a silent typewriter in the filing room</seg><seg type="columnLine">in another part of the ship. As fast as the sheets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper are typed the filing clerk binds them into</seg><seg type="columnLine">books, constituting the ship's log. But we must change</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes--here is a pair of magnetic shoes for you. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to wear them when the gravity is nullified or you</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't be able to walk about. While we are in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing in the ship has weight so you understand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity for magnetic shoes to hold you to the deck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Addison felt awkward in the shoes that clung to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpet-covered steel floor. The others, however, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wear them with the ease of long association. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly a strange feeling came over him, his heart acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">queerly and his blood rushed to his head, leaving him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DESTROYER	105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">faint and groggy. Then he felt pulled against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. It relieved his heart and drew some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood from his head, but it was disconcerting never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless. The feeling that was being forced against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor gradually lessened to be supplanted by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation of lightness that left him giddy. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though he were some plant on an ocean floor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his body were waving gently in the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With considerable difficulty Addison tottered across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room to a chair into which he attempted to drop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But attempt to sit down ended in his merely folding</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Grasping the arms of the chair, however, he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into the easy depths of the thick cushions</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he rested with a weightless feeling. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to remain so only by clinging lightly to the chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. There were straps attached to one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and after buckling himself in he felt more secure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Addison struggled to maneuver his unwieldy</seg><seg type="columnLine">person about this strange place of no gravity, Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gauthier was busy at a desk where, Addison observed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept his fingers hovering over several banks of keys</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to the old-fashioned typewriter.

The colors were brilliant, not at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the results from the old method of shining a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">light through a prism, for there was something vital</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the colors emitted.

"That is also true of educa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, of course.

Taking advantage of the desire of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored races for revenge after the suppressions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">extortions by some of the white nations during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steel Age, he has convinced them that, by their superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers, they can overrun the white race and sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jugate them.

Its speed is 'controlled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a compass and an earth speed indicator, all corrections</seg><seg type="columnLine">being automatic. We are now traveling toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west at about a thousand miles per hour, so we are, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were, keeping up with local time. Hence the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">are stationary. Should we change our course the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass and speed indicator would keep the clock on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper local time. For instance, if we were now flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">due south or due north along a meridian where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">local time is the same, the clock would run at normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. On the other hand, were we flying due east at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed we are now traveling westward, the clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">would run at double speed. Again, should we increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">our present speed in the course we are now holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clock would run backwards.

Much to Addison's amazement, the officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked up the wall that he might better view the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision apparatus which was too high for easy inspection</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the floor.

Instead of a feeling that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking up the wall, it seemed to him that the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">room rotated ninety degrees, leaving the floor to form</seg><seg type="columnLine">one wall of the room and the wall which he was climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to take the place of the floor.

Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">â–  eral ships crossed their field of vision, but every</seg><seg type="columnLine">move seemed to be so carefully directed that he ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to worry about the possibility of a collision at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightful speed. The ship was silent, ominously silent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Addison thought, although the crew seemed to be at</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease. It did not seem possible that this was a battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft on a dangerous mission--it was more like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure trip. Gradually a slight hum pushed its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the stillness. The captain listened a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a look of annoyance crossed his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Someone is careless," he said, pushing a button.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man appeared, evidently a mechanic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SILENT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is that hum?" demanded the captain.

"Hang onto me</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you take your other foot out.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted to walk but could gain absolutely no traction</seg><seg type="columnLine">for there was no force to set up friction between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and the floor. It occurred to him that he was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wisp of smoke to be wafted hither and yon as suited</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fancy of any air current that might stir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hang onto my arm to steady yourself and we'll go,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed the officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The visitor grasped the captain's arm and held him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self with some degree of success in an upright posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, although there was no load on the commander's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. When they started, however, Addison felt a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight pull until he was under way. Then the inertia</seg><seg type="columnLine">was overcome and he floated along with no hindrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his host. They were now in the narrow corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">which ran the length of the ship and Addison tried an</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment. Twisting on the supporting arm slightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he maneuvered his body until it was at right angles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of his new found friend and again experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the phenomenon of the corridor revolving to accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modate his position. It seemed to him that the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now walking up the side of a tall shaft in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Addison hung from a precarious position. Two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred fifty feet below was the bottom and the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance above was the top I He gasped with dizziness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then laughed when the thought of the absence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity came to his rescue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they progressed on their tour of inspection, Addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was astonished at the great amount of machinery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of great mass, and the number of the crew busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the ship. He shuddered to think of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">splash should the gravity-nullifying equipment fail!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The visitor's curiosity was aroused when he noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a continued duplication of small twin apparatus all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the shell of the craft. These were faced invari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably by a lens of some five inches in diameter for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the equipment; while the companion machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended what appeared to be a flat tube about eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches wide and half an inch thick through the wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel. The tube passed through a ball which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in a socket in the outer wall of the craft, permitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tube to be moved about and still keep an air-tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">joint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are these?" he asked his guide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">110	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That machine upon which the lens in the shell is</seg><seg type="columnLine">focused is an anti-nullifier.

While he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone Addison, clinging to the box to keep from floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, examined the contrivance. It was a hand tool</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a flat tube similar to the one shown him just</seg><seg type="columnLine">before but smaller. Addison noticed that the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about the thickness of paper and four inches wide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This ray," said the captain, laying the bar in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, "is used for many purposes.

When the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrests the atomic activity the cessation of atomic mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion liberates a great quantity of heat, but when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray is turned off the molecules build up again and use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heat. Since it is impossible to prevent some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heat from escaping, the mass cools down until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">has absorbed enough heat from its surroundings to</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnish energy for the complete crystallization;</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereupon the mass gradually warms up to room</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain pointed the ray machine tube at the bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pressed the trigger in the handle, sweeping the rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadside the length of the bar with one quick motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at once releasing the trigger.

"When the molecular structure is</seg><seg type="columnLine">disrupted, the matter loses its identity and builds back</seg><seg type="columnLine">up into most anything.

The officer lit a powerful torch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and directed the intense flame into the box. The frost</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted for some time despite the applied heat but</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually melted, at which juncture he turned off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch and picked up the resultant substance. Addison</seg><seg type="columnLine">was astonished to see that it was a diamond crystal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less regular shape but with a flat bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some of the atoms combiried to form air, so the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of this crystal is not so great as that of the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar," the captain explained. "We use this method in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory for making quantities of otherwise rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">elements, and for many fields of research. The lifeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms lie on the bottom of the box in the form of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine, almost imperceptible dust, but as they become</seg><seg type="columnLine">active they gather about the seed element and slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they crystallize, push the seed upward and build</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath it. We create any element or compound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether amorphous or crystalline, in this way. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have found a method whereby we render the atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">permanently dead and yet hold them together in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">form we wish. It is of these lifeless atoms that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">box is built. Another instance of the ray's use: the</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground laboratory and hangar was excavated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this disrupter and the atoms of the rock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth gradually turned into air and water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we are nearing our objective and I must return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the control room."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in the control room Addison again donned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes and struggled over to the control table.

"When an enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship is imaged on any of the crosses he is covered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the atomic disrupters. The firing board is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there," he indicated another table which Addison had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought was a duplicate control for the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain was feeding some data into the calcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating machine. After glancing at the answer he</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched a button in response to which a man appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strapped himself into the chair before the firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SILENT DESTROYER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">111</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">table. Addison watched this preparation apprehensively</seg><seg type="columnLine">but those on the ship continued their routine duties as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though nothing had happened. The captain sat at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk constantly punching figures on the calculating ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine and comparing the answers with positions on</seg><seg type="columnLine">maps spread out before him. Addison grew nervous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were evidently in enemy territory and all was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">readiness for combat. He wondered how it would seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find himself plunging toward the earth in half of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ship of steel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are over the territory of the enemy now," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evenrude without taking his eyes from the dials and</seg><seg type="columnLine">screens. "If you will strap yourself into the chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">between this and the firing table you can see what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The visitor strapped himself into the chair indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found it, like everything else in the craft, securely</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened. From this point of vantage he watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two tables with their alert operators. He noticed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly different color on the screens and asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have changed from infra-red to ultra-violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlights, or in fact, a band even shorter than ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet," Evenrude said without turning his head. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope that the enemy is not equipped with this latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention. If our supposition is correct, our lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not show up on their screens and thus give us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battle!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT first he saw nothing to indicate a ship, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently he noticed a spot on the second screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was slightly different in color than the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Number two, section twelve," Evenrude spoke to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gunner, and then to Addison, "That is the light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their infra-red searchlights. Probably a scout guard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the factory. I'll maneuver to get the craft in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen and on the cross-hairs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he watched, Addison saw the light become</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter and more concentrated and felt a slight pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure this way and that as the ship was being maneu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vered. Presently the enemy ship, appearing only half</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inch long, entered the screen from the edge. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a tiny fish with many searchlights reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and groping in the darkness. As Evenrude brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship closer, the image grew to an inch in length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Intersection twelve-two," Evenrude said quietly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gunner. "Ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Addison watched in fascination. Evidently Even-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rude had cut out the gyroscopic control for his fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">now danced over the keyboard as though he were type-</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing a letter in haste. The image of the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced and bobbed unsteadily in the little square but</seg><seg type="columnLine">persistantly edged toward the intersection. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a blinding glare of white light where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship had been. Addison blinked away the glaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">after-image and looked again. The enemy now ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared nearer the center of the screen, while at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the picture he saw an object for an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as it left the field of vision. He looked closer at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship and gasped. The nose of the monster had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cut completely off!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Intersection eleven-eight," said Evenrude as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing had happened. "We have them on the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fensive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stricken ship was now twisting and turning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw off the aim of its pursuer and Evenrude found</seg><seg type="columnLine">it difficult to get it into the intersection. For an instant,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Addison saw it approach the intersection and the screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enveloped in another flash of confusing light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he could again see the enemy appeared un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched, but it suddenly changed course and a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaving from the top left the vessel and continued on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the original course for a moment and then tipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward and dropped faster and faster out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field of view. Addison gasped. They had cut off a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slice as though the monster were a carrot!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Finish him on nine-thirteen intersection," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evenrude in matter-of-fact tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the struggle to get the enemy into range</seg><seg type="columnLine">began, a blinding flare that covered the entire screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">made Addison's eyes swim, and all was over. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he again could see, he was astonished to behold two</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects tumbling end over end toward the earth. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship had been divided through the center from prow</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stern!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Addison sat for a moment spellbound. A five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred foot ship had been cut into pieces and hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth with its crew of two hundred men, yet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">routine in the control room of the victor had scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">been disturbed. He looked about again and saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain calmly working over his maps and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stenographer voicing the happenings for the record in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship's log.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man entered, laid several sheets of red paper on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the commander's desk and departed. The officer read</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the pages and then gave one to the stenographer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to the television operator and one to each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men at the control and gunner's tables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was good work," he commented and praised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men. "We destroyed the enemy without much</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage to ourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Addison thought for a moment and then the signi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficance of the officer's last remark dawned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Without much damage to ourselves'. You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that we were damaged ?" he asked incredulously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain smiled grimly. "We caught the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaware but after the first attack they were active.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They cut a slice from the bottom of our ship near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stem. We lost about two hundred tons of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, sixteen of the crew are gone and seven wounded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They cut off most of the machine shop and all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew's quarters. The head surgeon in the hospital</seg><seg type="columnLine">says that all of the wounded will recover but it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">require much care in two of the cases."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Addison was aghast! To think that sixteen of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own men had plunged to the ground in a shaving cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the steel monster beneath his very feet, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had known nothing of it until now! He recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the horror and shock of this news and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtful for several minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why don't you insulate your ships with the material</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in the construction of the box in the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop--that 'lifeless atomic insulation' -- to guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the atomic disrupting apparatus of the enemy?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is only recently that we have discovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of holding the dead atoms together, but our new</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, which are now under construction, are so in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulated. But there were none yet in commission when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we left."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain returned to his desk while Evenrude put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship on her course again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are almost over the valley we are seeking,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the lieutenant. "I imagine that they know of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming and we may see some real action soon. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">may send a fleet of ships after us or they may use</seg><seg type="columnLine">112	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">anti-nullifiers from the ground. In either case we</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect a difficult time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What will you do to protect this ship?" Addison</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. It seemed hopeless to continue on the mission</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that he had seen the frightful effect of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons, and they were now reasonably sure that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy expected them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll turn on all of our disrupting guns and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin on our longitudinal axis. That will cut deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">gashes in the ground for miles around and possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy their defensive equipment. Of course, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a desperate chance that we are taking, but the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in a desperate condition at present so we feel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are justified."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Desperate Moments</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ADDISON turned this idea over in his mind but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was interrupted by a flash of red light from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument board on the wall. Lieutenant Evenrude</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut out the gyroscopic control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain came over and stood beside Addison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair to watch the instruments and give orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Close the master switch," he said calmly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunner. "We are directly over the objective," and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evenrude, "Spin 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Addison clung to the chair in desperation, forget-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting that he was strapped in. He felt his body thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way and that until his senses reeled. By an effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his will he controlled himself and looked at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm officers at the keys and then up at the screens.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First one and then another, in rapid rotation, flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into brilliant light!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He noticed the red light. Sometimes it was gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing brightly and again it went dark, only to flash up</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, each change being accompanied by a jar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the red light?" he gasped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anti-nullifier indicator," said the captain. "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">other words, when the red light is on our nullifiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">are paralyzed and we are falling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Change the course to three points east of north,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the commander. "We've gone beyond our objec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Addison watched the dials on the wall and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrified to see the altimeter sink rapidly while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red light was on but mount when it was extinguished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they were losing altitude continually; nearer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth with each flash of red!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had no idea that they were so well protected,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the captain with a frown. "If we don't destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">their antinullifiers soon we're lost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they drew nearer to the earth the blinding glare</seg><seg type="columnLine">that flashed successively over the screens became so</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright that Addison was forced to turn his swimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes away. He watched the instruments, and the wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">spinning of inclinometers, levels, compasses, and others</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew nothing of, gave him an idea of the wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">contortions the ship was going through. But he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel it, too, as his body was thrown this way and that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the advantages of eating pills of synthetic food</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than the old time bulky meals, occurred to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were only two miles above the earth's surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Addison had tensed himself for the frightful shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt must surely come, when the red flashes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instrument board became more intermittent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally ceased altogether. The commander gave an</seg><seg type="columnLine">order and the flashes on the screens ceased, the instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments steadied and all came to rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put her in neutral and we'll hold this position</seg><seg type="columnLine">until morning," said the Captain. "Apparently we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have destroyed their anti-nullifiers since they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually ceased to function."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Addison leaned back to gather together his senses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As time passed and he listened to the silence he dozed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor did he realize that he had slept until the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you wish to go outside?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Addison started and looked questioningly up at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim smile on the commander's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you wish to go outside?" he repeated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes, by all means."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was just peering up over the mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the east when Allison stepped from the ladder to</seg><seg type="columnLine">view the landscape. And what a landscape!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As though some giant had gone over the mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">and valleys with a huge plow, cutting bottomless fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows promiscuously in every direction as far as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye could reach, the territory was a riot of frightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Addison gasped in horror. He stared at the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">with blank amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This treatment is meant to be a trifle disconcerting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the enemy," the officer smiled. "It is only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second time in history that any battle-ship has torn up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground in this fashion. In fact, we are not per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted to do it except under exceptional circumstances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But go over and look into one of the furrows."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although the captain knew what to expect, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the crew had never seen such havoc and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded along the crevice into which Addison was</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring. They could not see the bottom of the cut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but were intensely interested in the sides. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms had taken up energy to again form molecules,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had crystallized into fantastic shapes of metal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartz that glistened and sparkled in the sunlight as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though striving to atone for the frightful wounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They explored farther down the canyon, jumping over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two foot gashes. They found the bodies of several</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunate Orientals who had been caught in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming destruction, and around a turn, two fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessels similar to their own. Addison traced the fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows down the mountain side, through the ships and</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the other side of the canyon--nothing escaped. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships had been cut this way and that into many sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, the edges of the incisions, as always, fringed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with glittering crystals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An Old-Fashioned Weapon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUDDENLY the captain stopped. Beyond the ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canyon floor widened to about a thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and here, as though the fateful plow had struck a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat rock and slid harmlessly over. The ground was</seg><seg type="columnLine">untouched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All hands aboard the ship," he ordered quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Battle stations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Addison was about to inquire as to the cause of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this sudden order when another quiet voice broke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim stillness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All hands in the air."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hands of the Occidental crew instantly reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward and the visitor turned to see who had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of the situation. He turned cold and froze</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his tracks! With some twenty-five men at his back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each armed as was he, stood a man with a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecule disrupter leveled at the exploring party!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Search them," ordered the stranger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the leader kept the first group covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SILENT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the deadly disrupter the prisoners filed, one at a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">between guards who quickly searched them and passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to a new and growing group. It reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Addison of the fateful trickle of sand through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck of an hourglass. Several of the officers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried small pocket disrupters and were quickly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed by the silent guards. Addison underwent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">search with apprehension. The guards took from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket a heavy black object and examined it curiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">but returned it to him--he carried no disrupter. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged over to Captain Gauthier and bent close to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Be ready when I make a move," he breathed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captives had all been searched and the leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the enemy walked up to Captain Gauthier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We expected a move of this kind, so insulated our</seg><seg type="columnLine">shops and hangars. You certainly changed the map,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we captured you and your ship. Thanks for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship," he said with a quiet smile. "We figured that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we turned off our anti-nullifiers one at a time you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would think that you had destroyed them--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap worked."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You win for the time being, Ghorski," the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">said slowly. "What are you going to do with us?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll question your men and then make all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you immortal. We haven't decided what to transmute</seg><seg type="columnLine">you into but have been thinking of a huge gold nugget</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the museum at Singapore."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Addison, who had looked upon Ghorski as a rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant person, shuddered, and any hesitancy he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt gave way to desperation. Quickly he drew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy black object that the searchers had scorned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed it at the traitor's right shoulder. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flash of fire and a report that blasted the stillness to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DESTROYER	113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms. Mountain peaks barked savagely at one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, while the two groups of quiet-loving men stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooted to the ground in horror that their sensitive ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be thus tortured. A queer look of mingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain and astonishment spread over Ghorski's face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he clutched at his shoulder. His right hand hung limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the disrupter slid from his numb fingers. Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gauthier, startled as he was, recovered himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the disrupter from the traitor's stiffened hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a tense moment and Gauthier was equal to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Addison turned his head away, and well that he did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A blinding flash that left the sunlight pale and sickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">by comparison lit the canyon for an instant. A wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">of frightful heat like the breath of an angry furnace</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed by, scorching his clothes and singeing his hair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly and apprehensively he turned and there, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-six men but fifty-two pieces of men lay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque huddles on the ground, frozen solid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Alright," said the captain quietly, feeling his numb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">outraged ears, ''well go down and destroy their</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory and hangars.

From out of horizontal chambers constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the sides of the craft's body just below a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of cabin windows, there appeared gradually, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide stabilizing aerofoils, spreading like the wings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eagle, that floated the ship to a graceful landing. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to feel a tremendous quake surge through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building as the craft landed, but there was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest quiver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Pleasant Meeting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INTERESTED in this new type of ship, I dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of my apartment and in a minute I was stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the landing beside it.

"What-how on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">earth -- what are you doing here?

That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a wonderful feat for the advancement of aviation</seg><seg type="columnLine">but of course it did not hold the dangers that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronted Lindbergh, considering the development of air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft since his historical flight in "The Spirit of St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My lord, Bob, you young bloods will get yourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed yet!"

To gain superiority over anything absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrecy must be practiced. Of course, the government</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the public an insight into the construction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft, but so far as mechanical principles are concerned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few have been thus far permitted to know them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't think it will revolutionize the aviation industry</seg><seg type="columnLine">to any great extent, in view of the fact that the govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment will not permit ships of this type to be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed for public use.

She looked like a tick nestling under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belly of a wolf-hound. Immediately she stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the cockpit, a vari-hued dressing robe around</seg><seg type="columnLine">her slender form and a tight-fitting helmet covering</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head, and there arose a great applause from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds of officers and civilians grouped around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Annihilator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True to the traditions of eternal femininity, Joan</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted the plaudits joyously as though she expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">men to slap their hands together in appreciation of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying ability if not the exciting warmth of her beauty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As she walked blithely toward the elevators which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would carry us down to our apartment floor, she waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an occasional acquaintance or spoke to a casual</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend.

His discomfiture under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinging lash of Joan's ready words was amusing</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, and I understood perfectly that Joan was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely playing with him. It was her way of enjoying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the companionship of her most cherished friends, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course Bob could not know this. She was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike any other woman--she made a man feel as</seg><seg type="columnLine">miserable as she possibly could; then would bring him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to normalcy with soft words and sympathy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following its usual sudden drop, the elevator's auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic doors swung open and we found ourselves in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, spacious hall of our apartment floor. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds walk carried us to my apartment. During</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rapid drop in the elevator Joan maintained a stoic</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude toward Bob. He seemed very uneasy because</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently Joan still resented the taunts that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">playfully heaped upon her during their younger days</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. I was enjoying it hugely, although I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that poor Bob should not be made to suffer just to</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfy Joan's coquettishness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've a nice comfy apartment here, Mr. Holdon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob volunteered as he seated himself in the spacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">divan in the living room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a word Joan made haste toward her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber.

I said, grinning. "She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing at you up on the landing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He chuckled softly and his face lightened as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled himself into a more comfortable position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm a dud with women, Mr. Holdon," he said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky to the east was murky with a heavy mist Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds hovered high overhead and the ominous roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant thunder could be heard frequently. The sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">had set in a horizon of blood-colored clouds and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very atmosphere seemed foreboding. Yet in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pending storm, commercial craft dotted the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying to reach their destinations and discharge their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargoes and passengers. From the murk high over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head came the periodical hooting of some huge craft's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right-of-way horn. Ordinarily, the usual storms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainty of the elements would not prevent craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">from keeping aloft, for air vessels were constructed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstand them. But the ominous warning from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington Weather Bureau had obtained results in</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far as pleasure flight was concerned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, Lieutenant Allison obtained the necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">passports permitting Joan and me to enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Annihilator. He ushered us into a receiving elevator</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been dropped from the interior of the craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor of the landing and we were lifted into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacious and luxurious reception room. Joan paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to greet an acquaintance while Bob handed our passes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Officer of the Day sitting at a little desk near</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rigid, metallic door that opened into the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">chambers of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pardon me, Joan."

It contained a great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxuriously decorated dining hall for commanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers and guests, well up forward. Officers' cabins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacious and neat, with double white metal bedsteads,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined a network of wide hall-like companionways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Occasionally it was necessary for us to drop down</seg><seg type="columnLine">small flights of rigid stairs and cross over metal web-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bings to get to other sections of the main deck. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired why this was necessary and I was astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn from Bob that all decks were suspended on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gyroscopic principle, like the old-time floating com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passes of the early mariners. By this principle, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained for my benefit, the decks would remain on</seg><seg type="columnLine">an even, flat surface, regardless to whatever angle the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of the craft might be tilted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, Mr. Holdon," Bob explained, hardly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving his eyes from Joan's enticing features, "this</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship is constructed on a sort of a fourth dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle. There are many new features that have</seg><seg type="columnLine">heretofore been untried. The gratings which we just</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed over are more or less heat radiators. It gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty cold above the 50,000 foot elevation and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have warmth. The Annihilator departs abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the old type of airship and is of rigid construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion throughout its exterior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Something New In Aeronautics</seg><seg type="columnLine">'â€¢^TpHE Annihilator is constructed entirely of cobalt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A steel with the interior structure of four-electron</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beryllium, the strongest and lightest metal known. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cobalt-steel structure is highly magnetic and to a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent conquers gravity through magnetic repulsion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is the first vitally important step of science to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the expansion of phenomena of electromagnetism.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To be perfectly frank, this ship can actually fly with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the use of the exhaust drive or any other mediums</seg><seg type="columnLine">of propulsion. Magnetized cobalt-steel, with its power</seg><seg type="columnLine">to repulse the gravitational pull, can carry this craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air at an astounding velocity. But by</seg><seg type="columnLine">adding the exhaust driving system, much has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to the speed of this type of aircraft. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity is increased some six hundred miles per hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are probably aware, Mr. Holdon, that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">equations of gravitational repulsion are not entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">new.

American</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists, working secretly in the Washington Labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tories of the government, have at last succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulating against gravity, proving the Einstein theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">that electromagnetism and gravitation are actually the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same thing. According to the theories of Dr. Bryce</seg><seg type="columnLine">B.

"He isn't so shy as one would think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All the same he's not a ladies' man, Joan," I said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"else he would have had a fine time trying to explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the development of electromagnetism, cobalt-steel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Einstein theories. By the way, Bob, what are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapsible aerofoils along the side of the ship used</seg><seg type="columnLine">for when it can rise and land by gravitational ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptance and repulsion?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you mean the safety aerofoils?

It does take a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to absorb all that stuff, Mr. Holdon, but now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I'm beginning to learn something about eternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">femininism, I think I shall ask for a transfer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Diego station so I can fly over here in an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see!

"It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost time for us to take off and I want you both</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps we'd better just look at the controlling</seg><seg type="columnLine">system, Robert," Joan put in.

Everything is encased in Beryllium</seg><seg type="columnLine">housings and various gases are forced from supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks into the explosive chambers and vented through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the driving exhausts. There are several generating</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamos operated from special air-pressure tanks, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnishes the electro-magnetic power for the repulsion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gravity.

Really it's worth seeing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's perfectly alright, Robert," said Joan, placing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand on his sleeve, "that will be an incentive for you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come again--to show father the controls."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't listen to her, my boy," I said, "It will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an incentive for us to visit you at Kitty Hawk! I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to see through that ship and I'm sure Joan would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to go through it again with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's great, Mr. Holdon! I'll tell dad that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are coming and he'll be down from Washington to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you." Bob said, pleased. "I've got to get aboard now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't want to be left-as much as I'd like to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main here. I'll be expecting to see you both in Kitty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hawk sometime tomorrow." He turned to Joan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good-bye, Joan," he said. "You'll come, won't you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We will, Robert," she replied, earnestly. ''We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave in the morning and be in Kitty Hawk in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for afternoon tea. My speedster can do it in three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you go to the Officers' Club dance with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow night?" he asked, eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you want me to," she whispered, softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, Joan! Good-bye, Mr. Holdon. See</seg><seg type="columnLine">you tomorrow. By the way, we'll broadcast our voyage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to New York. You can pick us up with your television,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you wish, but we will not be able to talk. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">your 42 power receiver you ought to be able to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship through. We broadcast at 24,500 Kilocycles</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the 14 channel band."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-bye, my boy," I said, as he took Joan's small</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand affectionately. "I'll watch you all the way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. My regards to your father."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that, Lieutenant Allison entered the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuttles of the receiving lifts and was wafted up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the control room of the Annihilator. Presently we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face at a control cabin window. Joan waved a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. I smiled up at him pleasantly and nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly a hissing sound surged through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Annihilator and I hustled Joan away. Spectators had</seg><seg type="columnLine">already taken to a safe distance. The body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship seemed to glow for an instant as the magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy passed into its cobalt-steel casing. Insulation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">repelling gravity, had been contacted and the ship rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air gracefully and swiftly, her driving exhaust</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes silent and dead. With an eagle-like swoop she</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned her nose upward in a-, half loop and headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward into the thick, murky haze. Long streamers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of brilliant light shot ahead of the ship and from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin windows along her trim strcam-Iines, there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the constant glow of her internal lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We watched the Annihilator as she passed out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision into the eastern blackness. She raced more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than five miles eastward before she suddenly opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">her exhaust tubes. Where we stood we could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady roar of her propulsion explosions. The roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually died away as the great craft gained momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tum. Occasionally we caught a glimpse of the streaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire trailing along in her wake. Gradually they too</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared into the blackened eastern heavens.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly, Joan and I walked into an open elevator and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon found ourselves in the apartment, glad to feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warmth of the automatic heaters, for it had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilly on the landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently I found myself studying Joan's radiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">features. Her dark brown hair hung in thin, curling</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisps around her temples. She had donned a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable dressing grown and was seated on the divan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanning over the pages of the Aero-Chronide. Oddly</seg><seg type="columnLine">she seemed a very different girl from her usual con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fident, impulsive self. Ordinarily at this time she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been scudding across the sky to visit some friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles away or transporting her chums to a party in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">snappy little aerospeedster. , Now she remained at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home for a quiet evening for the first time since we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken up our abode in Denver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''What's the matter, Joan dear?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing, father," she replied without lifting her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. "I just feel like staying home this evening. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you ask?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No reason at all, dear. I thought it rather odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you would elect to remain home with me so sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly. It's going to be a bad night, isn't it?" I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking over to my eastern exposure to scan the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What the Television Showed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH an almost constant display of lightning</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see the black clouds in the east, tumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently under an upward pressure. The heavens over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Divide were in an uproar. Thunderous claps</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached my ears and lightning flashed in long, jagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaks that seemed alive with fire. A terrible, fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful night over the Rocky Mountain summits! But</seg><seg type="columnLine">aircraft would avoid the upheaval of the elements at</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely the cost of a slight delay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly more than ten minutes had elapsed following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the departure of the Annihilator until I donned my</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking jacket and sat down at the television receiver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly I adjusted the controls and gradually the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape of the air-leviathan loomed on the screen, glisten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing under a coat of ice, which was very unusual for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this season. She seemed to be in the very center of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific storm and while the atmosphere seemed void</seg><seg type="columnLine">of snow, the ship was actually encrusted by ice! She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was traveling at an amazing velocity and I tuned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the powerful radio reception units of the television.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the hissing roar of her driving exhausts came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in through the super-dynamic reproductive coils. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddeness of its roar and volume caused Joan to jump,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously, stifling a little cry. I throttled the instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments until the roar was barely audible. Claps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder frequently caused the coils to sputter, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashes of high-tension lightning created an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow along the redudng units.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joan walked to my side and sat down. I turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the double-wave screen in front of her and tuned it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 14 channel band. The Annihilator, pitching peril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND GRAVITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ously and fighting to retain even keel, glowed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen. The great craft was at last above the Divide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enveloped by upward tumbling clouds thft whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the infinite like the spinning cone of a tornado.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The roar of a terrific suction-pressure and the low</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady moan of the ship's driving exhausts, sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominously in the reproduction units. Yet in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the maddened elements, the Annihilator seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding her own and I patted Joan's tensed hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuringly. She stared at the glowing screen, a worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">look on her ordinarily joyously alive features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll make it, Joan!" I said, although I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">keenly afraid that the terrific up-draft would win over</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a huge craft as the Annihilator. Despite her</seg><seg type="columnLine">super-powers to combat the elements, I felt that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was meeting her match in the whirling, upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, daddy," Joan said suddenly, "she doesn't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be moving ahead at all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared fixedly at the screen. The Annihilator was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitching and rolling dangerously, her nose leaping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">uick jerks toward the upper levels! Her pilots were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghting madly to keep her nose pointing to earth but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with each terrific upward jerk, she was lifted skyward</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an increasing angle. The Annihilator had en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered an up-draft, more terrible in its form than</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been for nearly a century!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God, Joan!" I gasped, "They're in it I Tune</seg><seg type="columnLine">your screen in on 24,500 Kilocycles slightly under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">14th channel band and pick up the ship's control</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly Joan's quick fingers manipulated the dials</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the surface picture of the Annihilator, rolling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbling madly, disappeared from the screen. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched on the reserve reproduction coils, auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matically breaking the circuit in the coils at my hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, simultaneously with the sound of shouting voices,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her screen glowed with a clear picture of the cabin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior! Together we watched the perilous motion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the craft and the excited pilots controlling the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her cabin. Alternating my gaze between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two glowing screens, I immediately saw that Lieutenant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob Allison was sitting at the wheel controlling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabilizing aerofoils at her tail, his face grim, deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined and pale. His hands clung to the jerking wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a grip of steeL He manipulated the control for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward occasionally and just as often the tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of the up-draft shot it back. He groaned once</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the controlling wheel shot back, pinning him</seg><seg type="columnLine">between it and the rigid accommodation in which he sat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He worked the wheel forward slowly. Each move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the controlling system was clearly defined on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen in front of me, for each time Bob shoved it</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, the Annihilator smoothed out, her nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed slightly to earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joan watched Bob Allison intently as he strove to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent the ship from shooting into the upper atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pheric reaches. I glanced at her face. It was white.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her lips quivered slightly as though stifling a sob. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said nothing, and concentrated on the scenes before us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That Bob was weakening at the stabilizing control</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easy to be seen. I groaned and Joan placed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking hand on mine. Suddenly his voice, weak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking, calling for assistance, came to us through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coils. Again the wheel shot back and struck him</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the chest with such force that it caused his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">to color with a bluish tint. I noticed a thin trickle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood oozing from the corner of his mouth. Joan</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed and hid her eyes. Bob slumped in his seat,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands frozen tightly on the wheel. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurry of activity in the cabin as other pilots dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the snapping control. I tore my eyes from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin scene and glanced at the ship entangled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling elements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scarcely had my eyes settled on the tumbling craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">than her nose shot upward with a terrific jerk!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly the Annihilator rolled over, on end, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged like a comet toward the upper reaches. I cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rapid glance at the other screen. The cabin was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an uproar and men were milling frantically back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth across the even surface of the gyroscopic floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob still sat in the pilot accommodation while two relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilots clung rigidly to the wheel, snapping them back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forth like whip-lashes. Bob was senseless from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady pound of the whipping control against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast. I stifled a groan. There was the son of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">dearest friend, in mortal agony and perilous danger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before my very eyes, and I was powerless to aid him!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan stared at the scene through wide eyes that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">moist and red. I felt a lump rise in my throat. Here</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was the end of the Annihilator, I thought, and-the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">abrupt passing of Robert Allison who seemed as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a son of my own as he was of my friend, Senator</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allison. I wondered if the Senator was aware of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">catastrophe. He probably was, I decided, and like our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, was watching through his television screens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each sickening plunge of the huge craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond Gravity</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUDDENLY a bright flash crossed our screens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from the coils at Joan's side came a quick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp voice. I listened intently. Joan bent over</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly, dabbing her eyes with a tiny square of silk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crisp and curt came the words through the coils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Official government orders," the voice said authori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatively, "All radios and television receivers and broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casters are ordered off the air at once!

She had gotten up and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone over to sit upon the divan. Her face was buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her arms and her form was convulsing with sobs. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down beside her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joan, darling," I said, struggling to swallow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lump that had risen in my throat, "he'll come out all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.

I asked, tilting her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear-dampened features up to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've always cared for Robert, daddy!" she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">without hesitation and with feeling. "You know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've talked about him always."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bob Allison is a man, Joan dear,'' I said, feeling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">124	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lump in my throat more than ever. I had denied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan nothing in all her life but here was one time</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I could not help her obtain her heart's desire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not bring Robert Allison back to her.

I patted Joan on the shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked over to the pane! and pressed a button</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the mail receiving tubes. Instantly the latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">edition of the Aero-Chronicle shot out into its recep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion chamber.

Nervously I watched the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, now on even keel and racing at terrific velocity</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the heavens at an elevation high above the range</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ordinary aircraft. In an instant the ship passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the screen-only the Washington station re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained fixed.

I hesitated to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan to tell her what I had heard. I continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen.

If you fail it's good-bye!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a buzz of conversation in the Washington</seg><seg type="columnLine">station as the Annihilator shut off her radio-telepix</seg><seg type="columnLine">system. I thought I heard Senator Allison's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was half tempted to make contact with that station</seg><seg type="columnLine">but thought better of it. I felt overjoyed at the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected developments, although I had a guilty feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for having deliberately disregarded the stem orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the government to keep all radio and television</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents shut off. But no matter, if my offense had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been detected, my rising hope would be more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Worth the cost. I switched off the receivers and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND GRAVITY	125</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for Joan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scarcely had I rose from my chair in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">television, than the Automaton Service buzzed again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fairly ran to it to receive the latest edition of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aero-Chronicle containing up-to-the-minute develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and official governmental bulletins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly I glanced over the single page of type.

We sat down on the divan and I explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her in detail just what I had heard of the official</seg><seg type="columnLine">communications between the Washington station and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Annihilator. Her face brightened perceptibly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I held the latest issue of the paper before her eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A short story in the center of the page told her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant Allison was improving steadily after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation and radium injections.

Joan's little stream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined aerospeedster sped through the sky like an arrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its twin-screws with reversal motion, spinning at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific revolution. Rain and sleet beat down upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny, transparent aerofoils of the plane with such force</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could not understand how such a frail-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft could bear up under it But Joan paidno atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the storm whirling around us. She kept her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glued to the instrument board, looking by turns at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glowing compass, the altimeter and the barograph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watchcd the barograph for a moment. The mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesium-tugsten-alumino propellers of the plane were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">revolving faster than ever before and were registering</seg><seg type="columnLine">16,542 revolutions per minute. The altimeter gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">our height at approximately 21,000 feet. I drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan's attention to the Velocity-Indicator. She smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gradually increased the acceleration. The tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship shot ahead with a jerk and the Velocity-Indicator</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle stopped at 750 miles per hour!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joan!" I said, heatedly. "You'll rip the plane to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces with that speed! Hadn't you better slow it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down?

The plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot like a comet through banks of murky clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally I scanned the earth through the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent plates set in the floor. We were over the long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white stretch of the Mojave Desert. A sand-storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was racing to the north over the desert but we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">high above it, the little ship bathed in the phosphores-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent glow of the moon.

It glowed incandescent hovering on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the far-off horizon. I could see the glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the fact that we were yet an hour from it. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at the chronometer on the instrument board.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had been in the air slightly less than an hour. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">computing the velocity of the plane I concluded that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would arrive in San Diego a good half hour before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time the Annihilator would pass over the perpetual</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-pocket high above San Diego.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I scanned the space below us. We were passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the central level of airlanes. Dozens of craft of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all kinds were skimming along the usual routes; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, at our great elevation, they appeared like long</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of eagles and gulls, passing each other in inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendent flight. I heard the roar of powerful screws</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead. I looked up in time to see a huge airliner</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass over us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently I found myself silently speculating on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming impossibility of rescuing the Annihilalor. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind likened the disaster with the historical catastrophe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the submarine S41 lying at the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantic beyond the aid of man. Then I began wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing how the San Diego rescuers would be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">compute the exact moment required in their attempts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deliver the driving-exhaust fuel to the Annihilator</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she shot over the pocket, just outside the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere. It seemed an utter impossibility--as im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible as it was for deep-sea divers to go beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">their depth to attach oxygen-tubes to the S41, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">126	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">raise it to the surface before life had fled from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">human cargo!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With those dire thoughts in my mind, I dozed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan was too intent upon controlling the plane to</seg><seg type="columnLine">engage in conversation with me, and as the aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedster sped toward its destination I slept, exhausted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by worry and grief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After what seemed an exceptionally brief period,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was awakened by a sudden shriek from the plane's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right-of-way siren. I sat bolt upright, bewildered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan was smiling at me and motioned for me to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">down through the floor squares. It was daylight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Diego lay directly below us, its tall flat-topped</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings rising like monumental obelisks. Hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of aircraft skudded through the air at various eleva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. Another day of activity had begun over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Southwest's aero-metropolis! The bay was dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly with amphibian craft and the government aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drome, with its swarms of fighting planes, stood out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in bas-relief against the green of the area surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Joan tilted the aerofoil controls and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane plunged headlong toward the earth. At a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed it shot, plummet-like, toward the landing atop</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Lindbergh Aero-Hotel. The building seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot up to meet us like some gigantic rocket. Wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistled and whined along the narrow aerofoils of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 6peedster as it sped in a perpendicular nose-dive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward earth. I sat in my chair rigid, struggling for</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. I cast a frightened glance at Joan. A deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined smile played around her lips and her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkled with the joy of the thrilling drop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For God's sake, Joan!" I managed to say between</seg><seg type="columnLine">choking gulps. "Remember that I'm an old man I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This will make you young again, daddy," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled.

I said, as she twisted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedster out of its nose-dive and pointed its whining</seg><seg type="columnLine">airscrews toward the government aerodrome across</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Diego Bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll go direct to the government field, daddy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you can't make a landing there, Joan.

The plane hovered over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field for an instant and then dropped slowly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground without so much as a warning from its siren</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell of its arrival. It settled between two gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">combat ships, their big guns casting long shadows that</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost completely hid the streamlined speedster from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the rising sun. But the plane had been observed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing, and before we could get out of the cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed guards had come up. I stepped out first, Joan</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopped down beside me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''I'm sorry, sir," said a debonair young naval officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I dropped down to the ground.

As the Annihilator races along the other air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, magnetized steel nets will be hanging from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her belly to pick up any of the missiles that might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her path. Therefore our guns will hurl shells into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air through the pocket over which she will pass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">five feet apart and at intervals of 30 seconds."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lord!"

The sky above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the airdrome was entirely void of any aircraft High</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, in the higher levels, a great white cloud floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazily across the sky. Over the city of San Diego</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, their heliocopters maintaining perfect balance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested thousands of aircraft, their occupants intent</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon watching developments in the rescue work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great Annihilator. Joan clung to my arm, tightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we stood some distance away from the batteries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUDDENLY the batteries roared as one with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific explosion that the earth rocked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled. The concussion lifted us from the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set me down with a thump, Joan sprawled across</seg><seg type="columnLine">my legs. I shot a rapid glance skyward. The heavens</seg><seg type="columnLine">were depthless. But a gradually vanishing series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whining notes told me that the first discharge of fuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Annihilator was on its way. I pulled Joan</seg><seg type="columnLine">down as she attempted to rise, and clapped my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">over my ears. Again and again the batteries roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at intervals of seconds. Joan hid her face against my</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast, sobbing. I looked over toward the platform.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commander Wilkins was standing close to a waist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">high railing, clutching it tightly. Other men sat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor of the platform. He alone was standing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hope Gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVENTUALLY the firing ceased and I helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan to her feet. Commander Wilkins, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a knot of gesturing officers and civilians, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking toward us. His face was grave as he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and saluted politely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should have warned you and your daughter, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holdon," he said, "that the concussion would knock</seg><seg type="columnLine">you down. I am happy to see that you were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">injured."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all right, Commander," I said. "I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have kept Joan away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think you will have any success, Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander?" Joan asked, apprehensively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can only hope for the best, Miss Holdon," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joan smiled with rising spirits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are going to watch the Annihilator on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">television screen, would you like to join us?" Com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GRAVITY	127</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mander Wilkins continued. Joan nodded. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the knot of waiting men standing a short distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. "Gentlemen," he said, "This is Miss Holdon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her father, former Congressman Holdon. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">will watch the Annihilator with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that informal introduction we accompanied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group to the Radio-Television Headquarters. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode toward the building I felt a hand touch my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. I turned my head and observed the serious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">set features of Professor Stilsen, Director of Astro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomical Research of the Washington University.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why Professor Stilsen," I greeted him, "I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize you in the group! What are you doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have been vacationing up at La Jolla, Mr. Holdon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "The government radioed me early this morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to come down here and help out as much as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could in gravitational and atmospheric details. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to see you, Mr. Holdon 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, Professor," I said. "It was nice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to help out. Of course you know that Senator</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allison's son is on board the Annihilator. He is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very close friend of the family. We flew over from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver this morning to watch the rescue work. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you think about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, to tell the truth, I'm a little doubtful," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied, shaking his head seriously. "It is and has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been my opinion that when the projectiles reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same atmospheric stream that holds the Annihilator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will either continue on through it or be swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the same course as the ship. There is a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance that the Annihilator will pick up one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells, providing it passes over the pocket at precisely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same second the projectile reached the air-stream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the other hand, the projectiles might strike the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and damage it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly three minutes had passed after the firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the last salvo from the batteries, before we arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Radio-Television Headquarters. Commander</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilkins ushered us into the rather large room con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining the powerful radio-telepix apparatus. The room</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the reception and broadcast panels was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like a small theatre with a fairly large screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wall in front of several rows of chairs. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down, Joan on one side\J me and Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stilsen on the other. Around us sat the remainder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the group, silent and tense. Commander Wilkins</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained near the panels and its operators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the few seconds that followed, the silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jr. the room was oppressive. I watched Joan. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat in stony immobility, her eyes boring into the blank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead screen. Professor Stilsen likewise stared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen, his lips twitching nervously and beads of per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiration standing out on his brow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the reproductive coils somewhere near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panels in back of us sputtered. A dim outline ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared on the screen before us. Joan grasped my arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely. Gradually the glistening body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Annihilator loomed and quickly passed out of sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The operators twisted the television dial-controls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly the leviathan moved back into the oblong square</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of us. Professor Stilsen let loose a groan</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointed with shaking hand along the tail of tha</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge ship. The aileron laterals and elevating aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foils had been tom from their sockets and were trail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing along behind the craft at a distance that, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen, appeared to be several feet!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" the Professor shouted almost in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzy. "They're done! The controlling aileron and</seg><seg type="columnLine">128	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">aerofoils have been shot away! One of our projectiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have gone through the tail of the ship 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joan screamed and suddenly went limp. An officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting at her side got up and returned with a glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water. I chafed her hands automatically, unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear my eyes from the screen. The Annihilator was</seg><seg type="columnLine">racing across the sky like a comet, a mass of wreckage</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been her aileron laterals, following her!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Around her, traveling at precisely the same velocity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were several tiny shapes that glistened under the glare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun. Some of the projectiles hurled into the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few moments before had been wafted into the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pheric stream circling the earth! There they remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the Annihilator and yet too far away to be of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">help to the distressed leviathan!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt Joan's hands quiver. I glanced at her quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was reviving. I looked again at the screen. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instant the scene had changed and in place of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Annihilator1s surface, the craft's control cabin con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronted us. God, what a sight! Men and officers alike,</seg><seg type="columnLine">naked except for their trousers, sprawled on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gyroscopic floor! They tore at their throats with</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzied hands. Several still, immobile forms lay at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side of the deck, hands across their rigid breasts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">embraced by death!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reproductive coils howled suddenly and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operators throttled down the volume. From behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">us came words that were punctuated with deep groans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wheezing coughs. We sat tense in our chairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan's face was hidden behind my back to shut from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes the terrible sufferings of the dying men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Annihilator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "H-h-ello, San Diego," came the rasping words</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Annihilator's choking operator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got you, Annihilator!" came Commander</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilkins' voice from behind in answer. "What's wrong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Annihilator?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'We're done-finished!" the ship's operator said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in a dry, weakening voice that was filled with soul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">searing sadness but void of fear. "One of your shells</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore away the aileron laterals and elevating aerofoils.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have no control over the Annihilator! We picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up two of your projectiles but we cannot make use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them because your shell also destroyed the exhausts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the driving system! There's a gaping hole under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tail stream lines and what oxygen we had in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartments is escaping. We can't last for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">six hours, San Diego! Thanks for the nitro-radium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You did your level best. I guess its good-bye to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">every-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute, Annihilator! Commander Wilkins'</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp, crisp voice shot through the speaking tubes be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind us. "Don't give up like that! Where's Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mander Rankin? This is Commander Wilkins speaking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to talk with him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't give up?" the Annihilator's operator said</seg><seg type="columnLine">scornfully. Then his voice came to us in shrill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysterical laughter. Presently he seemed to get con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol of his reasoning. "Rankin, sir? I am sorry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">report, Sir, that Commander Rankin has been uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious for an hour. I'll send for Lieutenant David--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before the Annihilator operator could finish, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproductive coils sputtered and went dead! The screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us became suddenly blank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Annihilator!" Commander Wilkins called</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically into the speaking tubes. "What's wrong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Annihilatorf We've lost you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The screen glowed for an instant and went blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. I sat stunned at a few broken words that had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">come in through our reproductive coils, during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant flash. The Annihilator's radio-television units</seg><seg type="columnLine">had suddenly ceased to function-her electrical cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent exhausted! The operator had yelled at the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his weakened lungs his final good-bye to the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had loved so dearly. _ Commander Wilkins cursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly. Joan's form convulsed in spasmodic jerks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the end!" I said aloud, dropping my chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my chest forlornly. Professor Stilsen's hand found</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine and gave it an abrupt squeeze. I nodded, unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lift my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           A Mad Plan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR what seemed ages we sat there. The room</seg><seg type="columnLine">was silent except for the sound of Joan's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsive sobs and the heavy breathing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. I looked sideways at Professor Stilsen. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">features were working oddly and his eyes glittered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he arose, the scraping of his chair against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor broke the stillness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By God!" he said, pounding his hands together in</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick, steady claps. "That's not the end! We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to save those men!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Commander Wilkins eyed him with growing interest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do it. Professor Stilsen," he said, tensely, "and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have the eternal gratitude of mankind!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To hell with gratitude, Commander!" he shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost running toward the officer. "If the govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment would listen a little more attentively to science</seg><seg type="columnLine">this disaster would not have occurred!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is your plan, Professor?" several officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked simultaneously and eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wouldn't understand!" he shouted hotly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you in the first place that there was danger of</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroying the Annihilator with your projectiles. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't listen to me. But here's my plan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eagerly and intently the entire room gave its atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to Professor Stilsen. I placed an arm around</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan as I watched his perspiring features. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That operator said they couldn't last longer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">six more hours! Evidently they have enough oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some of them to survive that long. In six hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Annihilator will pass over this aerodrome again!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know that for certain! With the earth rotating at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity of 25,000 miles every twenty-four hours and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer atmospheric stream racing in reverse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's motion at twice the velocity of the earth, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">six hours are required for the Annihilator to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete revolution! The very fact that it passes</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly overhead is a phenomenon exactly in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor. We've got to make use of it now, for at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next rotation of the earth the outer atmospheric stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">will shift its course and the Annihilator will be gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen to me! Laugh later if you want to but listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me now! Commander Wilkins, you will order your</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground shops to begin work immediately on con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structing twenty-four huge cobalt-steel, kettle-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums. I will give you exact specifications. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanics will fit onto the open end of each of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums, a six-inch thick, circular plate of steel! Socket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">damps will be attached to the rounded bottoms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cobalt-steel drums to accommodate stationary cables and</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-tension electrical lines! Get twenty-four large</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pinkerton winches each complete with cable enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach a distance of 85,000 feet. Weld cables to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether if necessary. By my plans and figures the</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND GRAVITY	129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cables need not be more than an inch thick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will attach these cables to the socket-clamps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By electro-magnetizing the cobalt-steel drums you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">insulate against gravitational force and they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntarily rise into the air, held captive to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchored winches. The electrical energy will pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the steel plate and produce a high degree of</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetism, forming a powerful electro-magnet. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-four of the magnetic drums will be sent up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an elevation slightly below the atmospheric stream in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Annihilator is held captive. I have figured</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the magnetism in the twenty-four drums will</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceed whatever gravity insulation that might exist in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship. Consequently it will be attracted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electro-magnets and be drawn down through the pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the earth's heavier atmospheres. By slowly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing the electro-magnetism from the drums, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current flowing through the steel plates, they can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lowered with the Annihilator resting on them under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the influence of magnetic attraction. We will anchor</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the ground winches at fifty feet apart, and permit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drums to rise directly in the path of the ship! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel certain that this method will bring successful re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults by drawing it back into the earth's orbit 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is my plan, gentlemen, and if you agree with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me let us get started at once 1 We have but five hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">to finish all ground work and thirty minutes to raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magnetic drums I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately the Radio-Television Headquarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaked with resounding applause. I glanced at Joan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her face was brightening. I felt somewhat relieved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surely this plan, formulated in the active brain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Stilsen while he watched the terrible scenes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the television screen, would result in the rescue of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Annihilator and its men-if any still lived</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when it reached again the pocket over the airdrome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Stilsen held up his hand impatiently to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stave the continued plaudits of those in the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen!

"Let us pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceed with the work before us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately Commander Wilkins spun on his heel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and issued crisp orders to his subordinates in the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then excused himself to the civilians. Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stilsen followed him out of the room. The others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">representing various papers, remained in discussion</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Joan and I made a hasty retreat. With five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours hanging on our heads, we had no desire to loaf</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the airdrome in the agony of dragging minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The airdrome had suddenly become a scene of ceas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less activity as we walked from the Radio-Television</seg><seg type="columnLine">Headquarters toward our plane nestling under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows of the big guns mounted on the huge, combat</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers. Men and officers were hurrying hither and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thither, clearing the field or executing the crisp orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Commander Wilkins. Great ships were being taxied</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the field and as we arrived at Joan's little speedster</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and entered its comfortable cabin, the triple screws</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big combat cruisers beside us roared. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced across the landing toward their hangers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joan shot her aerospeedster into the air vertically</seg><seg type="columnLine">and headed its screws across the bay. Within a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">we dropped down on the landing on top of the Lind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bergh Aero-Hotel, registered and went to the seclusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our suite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Last Effort</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEEDLESS for me to tell what transpired be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween us at the Aero-Hotel. The minutes dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly and we were at the point of nervous exhaustion</seg><seg type="columnLine">when finally the hands on my chronometer indicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the time had arrived for the rising of the magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums over the airdrome. Quickly we donned our</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmets and jackets and were soon up on the landing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan's plane had been hauled into a hangar and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamped a foot impatiently as it was being brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joan had long since recovered control of herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">although her face bore an expression of pallid rigidity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had offered silent prayers for the man she loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">since childhood, hovering between life and death in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Annihilator. That he would still be living if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leviathan was actually brought to earth, was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable. From her expression I presumed that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had resigned him to whatever fate held in store for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. With the choking words of the Annihilator's</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator ringing in my ears, I could not see how Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allison, injured as he was, could survive without suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficient oxygen to maintain life in his already weakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs. And six hours is a very long time to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">under those.circumstances, I thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Joan reversed the screws of her speedster</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it halted over the airdrome with heliocopter blades</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling for a gradual descent. The little plane settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the vacant field and we stepped out. A figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">came running toward us with a warning to move the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane from the landing. Joan entered it again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxied it into position near massed government ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end of the field. I was walking across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing under the guidance of the guard when Joan</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up to us, panting. She had ran across the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the effort had returned some of the color to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we neared a row of low, white buildings at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the landing I noted that they were strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent. The shriek and groan of machinery that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">creating an uproar when we had departed for the hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had died down. The very atmosphere seemed tense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eventually we entered the buildings and the guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">led us at once to Commander Wilkins. He was holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">a conference with Professor Stilsen and nodded as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came up to him. Professor Stilsen's face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimy with perspiration and dust. The professor ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cused himself and walked away swiftly. Commander</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilkins turned nervously. Joan grasped his coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How are you progressing, Commander?" she asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled assuringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excellent, Miss Holdon," he said, his voice filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with excitement. "We had a little delay with the cables</seg><seg type="columnLine">but everything is shipshape now. In a moment we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be ready to elevate the magnetic drums. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">winches are anchored on the other side of the landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so as to pull the Annihilator down against the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents, and the drums are being welded to the cables.</seg><seg type="columnLine">130	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">We've worked ceaslessly with this job, Miss Holdon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I feel confident that Professor Stilsen's plan for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rescue of the Annihilator will work out satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factorily."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's great, Commander!" I said, enthusiastically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The whole world will appreciate your efforts and I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain that the government will, too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As long as we succeed, and Professor Stilsen gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">his due rewards, I will be content, Mr. Holdon," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied. "That Professor Stilsen is a veritable moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of energy and knowledge! It is a shame that</seg><seg type="columnLine">men like him are not in command of the government's</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers instead of us who know practically nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but militarism!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came suddenly from the outside, a shrill siren</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast. Joan jumped nervously. I looked questioningly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Commander Wilkins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is time! he said. "Will you join me on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">observation platform?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before we reached the observation platform,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Stilsen had mounted it and was standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the rail. A long table-like bench had been built</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one side of the platform for newspaper representa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives. They sat in a line, radiophones on their ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking steadily into individual speaking tubes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried their words direct to the offices of their re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spective sheets, and automatically set the type from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vibration of their voices. The drone of their voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled together in a jumbled, unintelligable cacaphony</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unamalgamated sounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I helped Joan up the platform steps. Commander</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilkins followed close behind. Suddenly there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distant hissing sound. Professor Stilsen had</seg><seg type="columnLine">signaled for the high-tension electrical current to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into the magnetic drums. I hurried Joan to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the platform. On the far side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing stood a row of huge winches, their cables taut</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rising skyward rigidly. I looked up. High over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head at an equal elevation floated a row of odd look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing objects held captive by the taut cables. Even under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brilliance of the sun, they gave off a distinctly</seg><seg type="columnLine">discernible glow. The magnetic-drums were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air at last!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced at Professor Stilsen. His grimy features</seg><seg type="columnLine">were set. He held up an arm for an instant and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought it down rapidly. Instantly there came a high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched shriek from the spinning winches, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity nullifying magnetic drums were on their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">skyward! I held Joan close to me as we watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising drums. They gradually disappeared into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fathomless skies and we could see them no more. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Professor Stilsen. He stood tensely at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail, staring into a small glowing screen in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that told clearly the upward progress of the drums.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commander Wilkins was at his side. Presently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave another signal and the shrieking of the winches</seg><seg type="columnLine">died down to a low moan and finally became quiet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, their cables taut and rigidly motionless. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices at the speaking tubes on the table-like bench</seg><seg type="columnLine">droned excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly there came a loud snapping roar from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line of winches. Professor Stilsen groaned. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cables had parted several feet from the spindle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its frayed end, in contact with the high-tension</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiring was shooting vivid, blue sparks into the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The winch glowed for an instant and crumpled under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the force of the short circuited current. Joan covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes as several limp forms were carried away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've prepared against that," Professor Stilsen</seg><seg type="columnLine">volunteered. "Our doctors will probably bring them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shortly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pulled Toward Earth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">COMMANDER Wilkins patted him gently on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulder. I glanced at my chronometer</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously, and toyed with a wisp of curling</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown hair that hung from underneath Joan's helmet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She clung to me pathetically, her eyes on Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stilsen's broad back as though watching for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">move that would indicate the presence overhead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Annihilator. I too, found myself watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense form of the professor. Suddenly he stiffened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bent over sharply to stare into the screen in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There she comes!" he shouted exultantly. "Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose is dipped and she's standing still above the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of drums! The magnets are fighting the atmospheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream and the Annihilator is being attracted down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a shout of joy he broke away from the rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">and danced wildly on the platform. Commander</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilkins continued to watch the screen as a cheer arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the men stationed at the winches. Joan threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arms around my neck and hugged me tightly. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a feeling of exhilaration surge through me and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered a silent prayer that fate had not been too</seg><seg type="columnLine">severe on the brave men inside the Annihilator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked again at Professor Stilsen. He was stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the screen once more, his hands gripped firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's resting horizontally on the drums 1" he cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"One more second for the magnetic attraction to</seg><seg type="columnLine">circulate through the ship and we will haul her down!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He raised a hand over his head in preparation for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signal that would start the uniformly controlled</seg><seg type="columnLine">winches rewinding the cables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll retract the electric-magnetism from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cobalt-steel of the drums," he said as if to himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly lowering his hand. "They will fall gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their own volition, the attraction in the plating will</seg><seg type="columnLine">captivate the magnetic body of the Annihilator and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will wind in the cables."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite the tremendous weight of the cables, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums and the huge leviathan of the air resting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, the winches rewound the lines without apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort. They hummed softly as the incoming cables</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound around the huge spindles. High in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung a speck so infinitesimally small that my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">could scarcely observe it. There came the roar of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million voices from across the bay and suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere was torn with the shrieking of sirens and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shrill blasts of whistles. The Annihilator had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been seen-she was being hauled to earth I The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">voices of the news reporters continued their ceas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less droning as they acquainted the world with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts as they stood. Professor Stilsen sat down on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stool in front of the screen, mopping his brow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually the Annihilator was drawn earthward. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed in the heavens like a great bird suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken in flight. Hundreds of aircraft hovered over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it like swarms of locusts attacking an eagle. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed it at a distance as it came slowly down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without warning and with a suddenness that caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">my breath to cease, the Annihilator literally tore itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">free from the magnetic-drums and leaped back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">BEYOND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky! It shot heavenward, ploughing through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarm of aircraft like an unleashed demon. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic drums hung in position, deserted. I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken, unable to tear my eyes from the terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene. Joan screamed, and at the sound of her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">I withdrew my eyes from the rapidly rising Annihilator</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tumbling wreckage. I expected to see Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stilsen sitting on the stool, with his head buried in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Instead he was once again at the rail, waving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand frantically at the men lined along the winches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly there came a rapidly mounting shriek as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cables spun from the spindles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Stilsen grasped a sparking tube that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying beside the screen and yelled into it. I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead. Rising rapidly and gradually decreasing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance between them and the Annihilator, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic-drums were shooting into the higher reaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a terrific velocity. They glowed like green balls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire under an increase of electrical current.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Stilsen yelled again into the speaking tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the drums vomited green sparks under additional</seg><seg type="columnLine">current that was meant to hold the Annihilator at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">costs should they make the magnetic contact again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, very slowly the Annihilator checked its up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward rise and rapidly the drums shot up under it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The huge leviathan finally floated motionless and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">began a downward descent to meet the attraction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magnetic drums. There came another thundering</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of voices from across the bay, and this time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Annihilator was alone-no swarms of aircraft fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed her as she was being drawn slowly but surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned to Commander Wilkins who was standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside Joan, watching intently the downward course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the huge ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are either dead or unconscious from lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen, Miss Holdon," the Commander was saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Otherwise she would not have torn herself loose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drums."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has that to do with it?" Joan said, drying</seg><seg type="columnLine">her tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well you see," he answered, "the ship's electric-</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetizing units must have been working perfectly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending constant current through the cobalt-steel hull,</seg><seg type="columnLine">creating an insulation against gravity. They could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have known they were over the pocket or did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">care for that matter, otherwise they would have shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the units in consideration of the possibility of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectedly dropping through it into the earth's heavier</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere. Had the units been shut off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Annihilalor would not have shot upward. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have crashed to earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand, Commander," Joan said. "If the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electro-magnetizing units had not been functioning, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship would not have broken loose. The magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">drums would have held it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's rifjht, Miss Holdon," he replied, looking up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you really believe they are dead, Commander?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked, her eyes filling again with tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is hard to tell," Commander Wilkins an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. "They may be unconscious or very near so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably those who are alive do not know that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are inside the earth's orbit again.

Immediately she be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came surrounded by milling workmen and there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us where we stood on the observation platform the</seg><seg type="columnLine">resounding beat of compressed air hammers and cutters</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they strove to make an opening in the huge, cobalt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel hull. There seemed to be nothing to indicate that</seg><seg type="columnLine">any life existed within the Annihilator, and I hung my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Joan clung to my arm, her body sagging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Commander Wilkins nodded to me and I half carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">her down the platform steps to the ground. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">faltering steps she walked with us toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Annihilator. Apparently from nowhere had come auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive ambulances and hospital planes. White-coated</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trousered figures scurried past us carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretchers. I hustled Joan along to keep up with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid steps of Commander Wilkins and finally we</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at the side of the ill-fated leviathan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came an exultant shout from a gaping hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the side of the ship as the first limp form was</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed through it into eager, waiting hands. I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar sound of whirring machinery issuing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship as we came up to it. Suddenly it ceased. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">electro-magnetizing units had been shut down, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic drums still remained in position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a constant stream, limp human forms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed through the gaping hole made in the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Annihilalor. Joan tore her eyes away in time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forego the sight of one man, screaming wildly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysterically, being brought from the bowels of the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As terrible as it was, it caused my hopes to rise sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, for if one man lived, there was an odd chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that life existed in others. Joan kept her face hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind my back. I continued to watch and presently</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes beheld the familiar features of Lieutenant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allison. His face was pale as though in the embrace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death and I held Joan tightly as his inert form was</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to waiting arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had not wanted her to see that face but I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not withstand the agonized torture of standing there</seg><seg type="columnLine">without learning of his fate. I decided that if Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dead we should know of it, and I hustled Joan</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the milling crowd to follow the two men carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">his inert, death-like form across the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly we followed and as we walked along in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of a long, white building over which rustled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Red Cross flag, I explained to Joan what I had seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She gave a little cry and fairly flew toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital. I struggled to keep up with her. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were just entering a door with Bob's limp form</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we came up. We followed immediately into a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">room filled with rows of white-sheeted cots, some with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale, agonized faces showing from the coverings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">others covered entirely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joan dashed forward as Bob's form was being laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a cot, but two white-capped nurses halted her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm sorry, Miss," one of them said.

On the tvay back they get a radio message</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an oil steamer, stating that all aboard had been put to sleep for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours (as in all the other case) and the steamer rifled of 3,000 litres of</seg><seg type="columnLine">aviation gasoline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">Searching the Clouds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE had left the Parnassic at about six o'clock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York time, with a flight of nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve hundred kilometres before us.

She was probably one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">freighters we had sighted in approaching the Parnassic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, the hour given by the Westbury's skipper as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time when she was brought to--eight bells in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle watch, or four o'clock in the morning--revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the astonishing fact that the raid on the Parnassic had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been pulled off, sixty kilometres covered, and the oil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanker stopped, all within an hour. Even at record</seg><seg type="columnLine">airship speed, the flight between the two vessels would</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupy nearly twenty-five minutes, which left thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five in which to board the liner, break open the strong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and specie boxes, and remove three thousand kilos</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold before casting off. It seemed incredible that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one group of pirates could have effected the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We tried to work out the raids with every conceivable</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of craft, taking into consideration the time factors</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the six thousand kilos weight of gold and oil that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been carried away.

Cheerio, Dan!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick's request came on the heels of our own de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision. We had already turned on extra heaters and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compressed air, and were climbing good and</seg><seg type="columnLine">high. We kept up a bright lookout, but until Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his scouts hove in sight below us to the west,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper air was clean of aircraft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we dropped to meet him, Dick began an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other discussion. He agreed that the likeliest di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection in which to look for the raiders was to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward, and on his order his five scouts made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping movement under our bows to starboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was pretty to watch. He himself came near</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to us to let us see his cheery grin and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give us a wave of his hand, before turning to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">his scouts. Presently all six were the merest dots on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our starboard quarter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was worth while carrying a passenger like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Torrance. She was keenly alive to everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was happening, and, like her uncle, took a use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful part in the lookout. In fact, she had her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">so steadily fixed on the upper air that we were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">good sight of New York before she realized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I will say that her first view of the city was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most worthy of her. I have never seen the old hive</seg><seg type="columnLine">look quite so splendid. It was one of those cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright sunny mornings we sometimes get in March</seg><seg type="columnLine">that make everything look so clean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pale golden light picked out all the towers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pinnacles of the city in wonderful definition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they became mere points of light against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smeary blue of. the distance. This blue distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose up and up till it lost itself in the tawny base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sky, and from that, cloud was piled on cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an arch that curved towards us in gold and pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan and grey, to end in dazzling white against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep blue right over our heads. The waters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay looked in the sun like a filmy grey-green gauze</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying countless spangles, except where the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings threw their long shadows, which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep indigo with lighter patches of pure cobalt. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think even Lord Almeric was stirred out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitual quiet by the sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear," he said to his niece, "you are to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">envied.

Do you ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel superior?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bless you, miss," said Milliken. "I know the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's pulling at me all the time, and that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I'll have to give in and get down. You can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a god if your job has a string to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The philosophy of flying in a nutshell, Kir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steen," Lord Almeric laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see I must not become imaginative,'' said Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Torrance. "Mr. Milliken is braver-minded than you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are, Mr. Boon. I'm sure there are moments when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he isn't earthbound."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Milliken goes red, he gets black--if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irishism can be excused. I have never seen him</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite so dusky as he was when he pushed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merlin into the long drive that would bring us into</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hover to the landing-stage at the Battery. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a marvel to me how quickly he and Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Torrance had understood each other, and I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little envious of my mechanic. I'd have given</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good deal to have said something that pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, anyhow, the god's-eye view soon became</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordinary human view, and we floated gently up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the seaplane jetty just after the quarter to nine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My father had already arrived. In fact, I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Seven pass far below us as we came down over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Long Island. He was waiting for us on the landing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage, and he and Lord Almeric shook hands like</seg><seg type="columnLine">old friends. There was a trifle of formality to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with the customs, but that was soon over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lord Almeric and Miss Torrance poured thanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Milliken, who was to take the Merlin back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gardiner Bay, until he was almost ebony colour</seg><seg type="columnLine">with embarrassment. Then Dan and I joined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party to go uptown for breakfast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Faux Pas</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE we waited for Lord Almeric and Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Torrance to discard their wraps and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves comfortable after the flight, Dan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gave my father a full account of the morning's</seg><seg type="columnLine">doings. He already had heard the bare particulars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as supplied to the press by the captain of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pamassic, for the papers were selling in the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the news. The full force of the air police, both</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea and land divisions, had been mustered at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once to sweep the air in wide radius round New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. The navy and the river police were active</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the shipping at sea and in dock. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night, the territorial police had been scouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">town and country, examining garages and all places</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARK OF THE COVENANT	135</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where the thieves might be concealed, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">known criminals in New York of the safe-breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuasion had been rounded up and their haunts</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly examined. But no clue to the where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abouts of the stolen gold was discovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The chances are that it is in the air at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present moment, dad," I said to him. "We must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have passed somewhere near the airship--if airship</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was--on the way out. We must have sighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Westbury less than half an hour after the pirates</seg><seg type="columnLine">left her. If the airship is making for the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">continent at all, it can hardly escape being seen, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, with all those police machines out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think they'll be able to send her down?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It depends greatly in what circumstances they</seg><seg type="columnLine">come on her. She may be too high to be got at in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an open plane, and the police machines are no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toriously unsuited for high altitudes. But the fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sees her may be able to broadcast her position</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all aerodromes, and so get properly equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes to help. I won't consider she's escaped until</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark has come on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's hope you prove right," said the old man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Things are too uneasy to be comfortable, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution of the mystery would stave off a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble for the business world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Torrance and Lord Almeric joined us then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we went in to breakfast. The talk, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally, was still of the robberies, until the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">bankers fell to discussing some obscure financial</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation. Lord Almeric, asking his niece for con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmation of some figures, effectually isolated Dan</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself, and it was with something of awe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we heard Miss Torrance talk familiarly of millions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">using such phrases as "ranking pari passu," "funded</seg><seg type="columnLine">loan." "par of exchange." In spite of her obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiency, the talk fell strangely from the lips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a pretty girl. I think even my father was</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have a wonderful grasp of figures, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Torrance," he smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wonderful because of my sex, Mr. Boon?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not at all," said my father; "wonderful in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">case."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My niece," Lord Almeric explained, "comes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stock famous in mathematics.

The country was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone over, as it were, with a fine sieve, without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest result.

I went right to the headquarters of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">air police, where there was a chance that I might be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">known, and was lucky enough to find the local com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mander an enthusiastic supporter of the Aeronautical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Research Society, of which I was an office-holder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The raid on Louisville was simply the Wall Street</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Newark affair on a smaller scale. The sleep had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come upon the police and the watchmen at two o'clock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the morning, and the strong-rooms of the banks had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been cut open by the same means as that used in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARK OF THE COVENANT	139</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">York. Gold to the amount of a million dollars had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been taken from the four banks, with securities to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount not stated, but these last had been found at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Post Office in two envelopes addressed to local</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospitals. The hospitals also were the recipients of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">box of radium each, smaller than, but otherwise iden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical with, those left in the New York Post Office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The robbed banks might roughly be put in groups of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two: the National Bank of Kentucky and the Fidelity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Columbia Trust in Main Street, and the Citizens'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Union National and the Louisville Trust in Fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street. It might have been possible for the raiders to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have effected their anaisthetizing with two bombs such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I had imagined had been dropped in New York, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I looked for the smears of glass as best I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dense crowd, I was disappointed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A feature of this raid was that the Post Office had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been affected by the ana:sthetic, doubtless because it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood across the way in Fourth Street from a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">grocery establishment from which a quantity of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estibles has been abstracted. In this food-store, Messrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shapp &amp; Zort, money had been left to pay for the goods</seg><seg type="columnLine">as in the case of Schomberg's in Newark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we arrived, the news had just come through</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a gasoline container down the Ohio to the west</seg><seg type="columnLine">was showing a deficiency of fifteen hundred litres of</seg><seg type="columnLine">aviation spirit. The sequence of coincidence was</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you give me any information about the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars that were running at the time of the raid ?"

"The thing's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone rusty!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I expected it would be," said I. "Thanks very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My commander friend was rather astonished at</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he thought was acumen on my part, and as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down to the levee, I told him a few facts about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the New York raid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is a big thing, Mr. Boon," he remarked as we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out on the levee.

"Hurry up and sell a</seg><seg type="columnLine">copy or two to the air police. If all you think about</seg><seg type="columnLine">these pirates is true, we can do with a few like her."</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a close inspection of the plane, we said good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bye, and Milliken and I took off up the river, heading</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Pittsburgh. We wanted to see about our new</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was one o'clock when we left Louisville and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the suburb of the steel town shortly after two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While we inspected the engines, a boy was sent out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring us in a quick lunch, which Milliken and I ate</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we made our inspection. The engines were splendid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the charts of their tests showed a wide margin of</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiency. They were ready to be crated for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey. I got an idea, and turned to Milliken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, Milliken," I said, "why don't we-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "--take them with us," he finished with a grin. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just thinking what a pity it was to leave them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mercy of the railroads."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can she do it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can she do it!" Milliken repeated scornfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Huh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The job presented no great difficulty. We unshipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limousine top of the Merlin, then laid stout battens</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the floor of the cabin. The three engines were</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought, one after the other, on a traveling crane into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat-shed, and were lowered into the open cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To preserve our flying balance, we had to bring them</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward almost up against the pilot's seat. The job</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over and the top replaced by four o'clock, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">set off for Long Island, six hundred kilometres away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Serious Conference</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS we passed over the northern spurs of the Alle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghanies, dotted with little towns and hamlets, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to me, with all my thoughts on the raids, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not beyond possibility that a camouflaged airship</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed could be concealed among their woods and valleys.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were spaces wide enough, sparsely inhabited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the secrecy of such a base could be preserved for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good length of time, sufficient--except for accident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any rate--to enable the raiders to carry out quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of operations before making their get-away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Remembering the wide areas of thinly populated land</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this modern America, even within a few hours'</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking distance of the crowded Eastern states, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to me that the hunt for the lair of the marauders</seg><seg type="columnLine">140</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily be a long one. It was amazing to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the airship could so easily descend on a town</seg><seg type="columnLine">without observation and vanish, so to speak, in thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. In none of the raids so far had there been any</seg><seg type="columnLine">reliable story of the vessel having been seen--except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dream of the besotted Finn, Klenski. There had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the usual crop of lies, fantastic enough to defeat</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, but the clear, unstrained evidence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible witness was lacking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although none of the raids had been attended by</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss of life, there was something terrible in the silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach in the middle of the night, the uncanny power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of robbing all waking folks of consciousness, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid operations in the dead quiet, and in the stealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat when the work was done. It did not need the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recollection of the first sight of the helpless Parnassic</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make one's hair prickle at the thought of the mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velous potency in the hands of creatures more definitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">malign than the raiders had shown themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I thought of these things, a whimsical notion</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to me, and I turned to Milliken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder if they use the Boon double silencer?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shouldn't be surprised," he returned, picking up my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought with that queer quickness of his. "There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mechanic down at the Louisville levee who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake all night. He never heard the slightest hum."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was he out of doors during the time of the raid</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And saw nothing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you ask him if he looked up at the sky?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I didn't bother. He was an air mechanic, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had to grin at Milliken's sparing way of making</seg><seg type="columnLine">enquiries. He knew too well that an air mechanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be sure to glance up at the wind indicator, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every now and then look for any change in the weather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny thing if they're using my silencer," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh!" said Milliken, and I had to guess whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">he agreed or otherwise with my sense of the curious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We made Gardiner Bay before six o'clock, and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">all hands on to unloading the new engines. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">shunted them through the sheds on the overhead elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tro-magnets, and deposited them, each to its own bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the new planes ready for fitting. Milliken was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">content until he had the propeller and the engine cap</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed on one of the buses, just to get an idea of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pretty," he said grudgingly, "quite pretty.

There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of gravity in both my father and Lord Almeric,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they spoke without restraint, discussing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louisville affair very keenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The radium settles it," said my father.

"It is hopeless for your press to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attribute it all to a revival of the I. W. W. idea. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who give gifts of radium to hospitals and research in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitutes are hardly of that kidney."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said my father.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What would you say was the notion back of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all?" I asked them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heaven alone knows!" the old man burst out. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have come at a more awkward time. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have enough on our hands already--eh. Lord Almeric?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Truly." Lord Almeric nodded gravely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had better take my son into our confidence, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lord," the old man said formally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I agree. It would be better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Trouble Brewing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE old man turned to me and gave me a keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jimmy," he said quietly, "Lord Almeric will agree</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me that the world is ready to seethe over. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less we can pull back in time, we will be in a world</seg><seg type="columnLine">war again. Let me show you our situation here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japan, over-populated in the most appalling fashion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is knocking at our door insistently, wanting some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our room. The British dominions are closed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow immigrant, and Japan is prevented by the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">from getting all she wants in Siberia and China. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">pot is ready to boil over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Take the European situation.

Then there's that hotbed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaggering, clashing nationalities, the Balkans, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">new state more bumptious and aggressive than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. I tell you, Jimmy, if any lesson came out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that war, where you fought, and which cost so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">in treasure and blood simply chucked away, the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">has forgotten it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARK OF THE COVENANT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">141</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why on earth can't they all settle down with what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they've got and do a bit of work?" I asked.

"Money. Each nation</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinks the other is making more than itself, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">without working for it.

But we may find ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">on opposite sides, willy-nilly, if some of the hot-heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to blows. If America had to take a firm hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Japan, what could Britain do? If she sided with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japan, she would alienate her overseas dominions, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not have the Jap on any consideration. If we in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britain supported America, we should endanger large</seg><seg type="columnLine">financial interests we have in the East. We should</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay our Eastern possessions at the mercy of the yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, for new China would be dragged in. It is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceedingly complex situation, Jimmy, and not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that can be threshed out after dinner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me accept it as threshed out," said I. "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you, Lord Almeric, and dad come into it ?'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the money side," said the old man. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lots of them that would like to fight, but they can't do</seg><seg type="columnLine">it without money. And there are numbers of people</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking for loans at the moment, ostensibly for devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opment work. We have to go very carefully. Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almeric's mission in America has been for the forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of an understanding between Britain and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">people as to how far we may go in this or that direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. In our discussions--between an American group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of financial firms and banks and an English group, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">represented by Lord Almeric--we have come upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new situation that may well upset the whole arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.

We had a winner, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime, the old Merlin was being tuned up</seg><seg type="columnLine">--not that she needed much tuning--and the work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting in the extra tanks for the Atlantic flight went</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead.	,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lord Almeric's luggage was brought over by Didcot</seg><seg type="columnLine">142	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Seven, and everything was put in order. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigged up a pair of collapsible bunks from the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the cabin, so that our passenger could sleep if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted to, and so that Milliken and I could lie down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our off spells. Then we had a little vacuum-box</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hot food, and everything necessary for feeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">in comfort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At seven o'clock on the Thursday evening, we said</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-bye to my father and Dan Lamont, who had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to see us off, and to a great "Rah-rah I" from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">staff of the workshops, we shot off across the bay, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merlin quietly picking up into her cruising speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">four-fifty kilometres an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The weather report had given warning of low storms</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the coast, and we climbed high to ride over them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so there was not much to see below us. At three thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand odd metres up, we came into a side wind from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north, fairly strong, which must have given us a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drift. But the Merlin was flying easy, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no pitching to speak of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Milliken relieved me at eight, and I joined Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almeric in some food, for we had not dined before</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving. He was a charming companion, who talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">interestingly, and had the knack of making one talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well. It seemed that there were few corners of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth he had not visited, and his outlook on life was</seg><seg type="columnLine">correspondingly wide. There was nothing insular about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. With his open collar and its old-fashioned broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk cravat, of the shape the English call "Ascot," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked what he was, a very distinguished Englishman</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the best type, but the curious thing was that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared as much at home in the cabin of the Merlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he would have been in his own library.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I spelled Milliken so that he could have some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to eat, Lord Almeric continued his talk with him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">charming my mechanic into an unwonted loquacity. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gently done, and it had its reward, for Milliken</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he did talk talked very much to the purpose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Over my shoulder I heard more of Milliken's life laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare to Lord Almeric in half an hour, than I had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mechanic in the years we had been working</seg><seg type="columnLine">together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, if you'll excuse me, sir," I heard Milliken</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, by and by, "I'll just chuck some of this stuff over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board and wash up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me bear a hand," said Lord Almeric. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">wash and I'll wipe I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If it comes to that, sir," said Milliken, "you wash</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'll wipe.

And here's a dish-cloth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A rush of cold air at this moment made me turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">round.

Only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilians were about the streets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I found four star-shapped splatters of powdered</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARK OF THE COVENANT	145</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">glass on the Exchange side of the Bank, and two in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of courtyard within the buildings.

We went</seg><seg type="columnLine">along Old Broad Street, and there I found traces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the powdered glass, three splashes, opposite the robbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks. I thought it would be a waste of time to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything further in the way of investigation. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen enough to convince me that it was the Wall Street</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Pamassic gang, or another allied in method.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were convinced that the raids were an American con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cern. The measures are being adopted, after prolonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussion, but they come too late, as usual, to be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any service." He laughed grimly. "We shall prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably have the masks and the cages ready by the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raiders have been run to earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you think that, you will have your scouts out?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They have been in the air this last hour or so, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boon," replied said Thomas, with a smile. "I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand from Sir Almeric that you have been on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene soon after each raid?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With the exception of the West bury, yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are some points on which I should like the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit of your experience, Mr. Boon-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anything I can do, sir-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He questioned me shrewdly, until I had covered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground of the whole raids, down to the minutest detail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then when he had satisfied himself that he had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted all my information, he got Lord Almeric to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have an ocean track chart found for us, and we pored</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took the Transatlantic Company's airships a net</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty hours from New York to London, but a less</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily-built machine might do it in fifty-odd. Adding</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the difference in time between the two cities brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time occupied to about sixty, gross. That is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say: if an airship with a cruising speed of about one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty kilometres per hour had wanted to be over Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don just after midnight on Friday, she would have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave her base on the American continent not later</seg><seg type="columnLine">than midday on the Wednesday. But the chances were</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, to escape observation, the departure in actual case</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been made in the dark of the early Wednesday</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Calculations</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Louisville raid happened on Sunday night and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monday morning, and it was likely that the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship had made her base either in the dark of the Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day morning or on Monday night. Leaving Louisville</seg><seg type="columnLine">about four after the raid, it would be six before she</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached any likely base in the Alleghanies, and by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the farm folks would be about on their morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">chores. The vessel could hardly escape being seen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light at six o'clock. This brought us back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">notion of a base at least twelve hours' flight from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louisville, and gave additional color to the theory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a base over the Canadian border, probably in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">undeveloped district back of Ontario.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To berth an airship on the Monday evening, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have her fitted out again for a raid across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantic within thirty-odd hours, was something of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat. There was the unloading of the Louisville haul,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the refilling of the ballonets with gas, the retuning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engines, and the general tightening up and over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauling necessary for such an important voyage. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raiders were using only one dirigible, she was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder of efficiency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was quite within possibility that they had two</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines for their operations, and the three of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussing the situation in Lord Almeric's room were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not inclined to dismiss the idea idly, when we con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered the daring which could conceive and carry out</seg><seg type="columnLine">raids on such a wide radius, and the magnitude of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">organization behind the conception. Indeed, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">not too far-fetched an idea that the organization oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated from bases in both the Old World and the New,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that in imagining one solitary lair in Ontario we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seriously underestimating the power of this mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There seemed to be neither rhyme nor reason in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations. Of several millions of pounds sterling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold lying in the Bank of England, the raiders had</seg><seg type="columnLine">abstracted merely one, so Lord Almeric told us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the trouble that had been involved in forcing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three joint stock banks had not yet been rewarded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finding of any gold; but in each of these banks</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been the same insensate destruction by acid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thousands of pounds' worth of bearer securities. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like the work of madmen, impish destructive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and senseless expenditure of energy. Why trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">to force four banks when there was sufficient loot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most important?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It might have been," I suggested, "that they broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">146	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">open the Broad Street Banks first, were disappointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a haul from them, and destroyed the securities out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of spleen then came onto the Bank of England only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find that there was more gold here than they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away with."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid, Jimmy," said Lord Almeric, "that that</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation will not serve. It is a matter of almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">daily news how much gold is deposited in the Bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. It is also common knowledge that the joint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock banks since the war have kept no reserve of gold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but have had a working arrangement with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These are not criminals in the ordinary sense," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Thomas. "The distribution of the radium points</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that, the care that has been exercised to preserve</seg><seg type="columnLine">life in the raids. There is some idea, as you have said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Boon, underlying it all, and the future will prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably show what the idea is. We may regard this raid</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a demonstration of power, an attempt to bring chaos</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the business world, to upset values--some cranky</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of advertising an idea, presently to be revealed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I may be allowed to express what is merely an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuition on my part, I do not believe that these raiders</seg><seg type="columnLine">value even the gold they have taken. They have mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velous power--marvelous! But the vulnerable point</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any scheme of attack is its weakest link. That is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air in this case. I cannot believe that the scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the raiders can be carried out with a dirigible. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have proved the vulnerability of the airship time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and it is on this point that we will get them. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall not concern myself solely with looking for these</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminals or cranks on solid earth. I will keep after</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in the air, and, by God--get them, too!--if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are on my side of the globe 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And Fears</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Â«Â«T)ULLY for you, General!"

"The best thing you can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to get back to America at your quickest speed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitch into the authorities there.

I said. "Where did you get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here," said he. "Knew that the sooner I got on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the job, the better, seeing that we'll be going back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-morrow.

Did you have any breakfast ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a quick-breakfast counter and hot-dog cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the street on the other side of the bridge," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milliken.

As Milliken had said, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as sound as a bell. I worked with the men until mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, when I walked to Scotland Yard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told all I knew to half a dozen detectives, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood the fire of questions they shot at me, until at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">they all got up and trooped out, solemnly shaking hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, each one of them. Then Sir Thomas came</seg><seg type="columnLine">along and inspected the Merlin. He expressed a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion of it and offered to use his influence if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to dispose of it to the British Air Board. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him that would depend on what the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">authorities thought of it, and if they'd approve of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britain having it, my own country naturally coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">first with me. He patted me on the shoulder at that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said I was quite right. Then we had lunch to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether at his club, and after that I collected Milliken</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pulled him around the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crowds were collected here and there about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets, and you'd come on small knots of people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing like mad over the papers. It did seem as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody cared a red cent about the raid on the banks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that everybody thought a great deal of the joke</seg><seg type="columnLine">played on the British ministers. I knew that many a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minister and public servant had been sent into retire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment through ridicule in France, and that the trait</seg><seg type="columnLine">was peculiar to the French, but if the Cabinet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">British government could stand the guffaws that went</seg><seg type="columnLine">up that afternoon, they were gummed to their seats</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Hercules cement. I collected a few of the journals</seg><seg type="columnLine">for future reference, and took Milliken to a picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was late again when we got back to Lord AI-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meric's, and we found his lordship waiting for us, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whiskey decanter all ready. When at last we did</seg><seg type="columnLine">go up to bed, he came into our rooms and pushed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tissue-wrapped package into my hand, and another into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milliken's. Then he went away before either of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">could say anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must say that Lord Almeric had speed in doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindnesses.

Lord Almeric and myself were having</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast together, and had barely started when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant came in with word that Sir Thomas Basildon</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to speak to his lordship on the phone. Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almeric came back with ever sd slight a ruffle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement on his habitual calm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Basildon was right," he said.

I exclaimed. "Then it looks as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have more than one airship in Europe, Lord Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meric. From Berlin to Paris is well over seven hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred kilometres, and the voyage would take the aver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age airship more than four hours.

He turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">butler. "Sir Thomas Basildon will have breakfast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bunter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very good, my lord."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are beginning to find the amazing measure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our mysterious enemy," Lord Almeric went on. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be a huge organization. Think of the quantities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ore which must have been reduced to result in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that radium--and the expense of the operation! Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amount left in New York, Louisville, and London</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, represents as much money as has been taken in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the various raids. That alone is a staggering fact.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The preparations for these raids must have occupied a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm with you there, Lord Almeric," said I, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret has been astonishingly well kept. It beats</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to know how the airships could have been built and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their docking sheds erected without the connivance, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least the hoodwinking, of the government in which-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever country the bases of the raiders are situated. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said bases--because the thing gets bigger every bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">news. How can we be certain that there aren't a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of bases both in Europe and in America ? I'm begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to get fogged, Lord Almeric. When the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">first started, I thought we were up against an ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang of crooks using new methods, and that one en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARK OF THE COVENANT	149</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">counter with them in the Merlin, once she was carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">her armament, would settle the business.

"But you are taking the only way in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which you personally can deal with the situation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy. If you can persuade your government to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully prepared for further raids, you will do a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">service.

It will be an interesting fight if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever occurs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's the devil of it," I said.

"The raid on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berlin seems to have started at half-past twelve this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. The district round the Reichsbank was sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected to gas at that time, while the Berliners were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their pleasures. It was seen that something queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happening. Folk venturing over a certain fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite line simply fell staggering to the ground, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">others outside the line could watch it happen. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">police tried to get into the district, but met with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It did not dawn on anyone," he went on, "anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in authority, for some time, that the city was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a similar experience as that of New York and</seg><seg type="columnLine">London--even though I had warned the police yester-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day morning--but at last gas-masks were sent for.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were no good against the anaesthetic.

Would you oblige</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with the mustard, Mr. Boon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did they try to get above the district in the air?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked, passing him the pot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Realization of War</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"'T'HANKS," he said. "I'm coming to that. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 they were still fiddling about with the masks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making bull-foolish rushes into the gassed area, nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thought of calling out the air scouts. They found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air clear on the tops of the buildings, and tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach that way, but of course came to openings</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were impassable. It was over an hour before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first air scout came wheeling over the district--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned fools--and by that time there was nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen above or below. About two o'clock it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to get into the area, though here and there the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">police were overcome by the gas even then. Pockets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose, where the fumes--or whatever it is--had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispersed. Only the Reichsbank had been forced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no gold to take, but not only had securities</seg><seg type="columnLine">been destroyed, but the bulk of the ledgers had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely obliterated by the use of acid. This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazingly good ham, Pluscarden--your own breeding?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good God!" said Lord Almeric. "Yes--the ham</seg><seg type="columnLine">is from the farm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've seldom tasted better," said Sir Thomas calmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," he went on. "A pretty rotten trick! The usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes of radium had been left, this time in the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. By one-thirty every available aeroplane was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, but though they may still be searching, up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">now there has been neither sight nor sound of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiders reported. That's Berlin. Now, here's a fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will make you pause and consider, Mr. Boon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within three hours, Paris was visited."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One moment, Sir Thomas," I interrupted. "Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours' actual flight--or clock time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean three hours' actual flight," he replied. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembering the hour difference between Berlin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris clocks. Shortly after three, Paris time, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiders had descended on that city. Here some con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable time passed before it was discovered that any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing uncommon was in progress. The raid was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated on the Banque de France, and, if you remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber your Paris, there's not much doing just there, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the Avenue de l'Opera close by may be swarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with night-birds. As soon as the alarm was given</seg><seg type="columnLine">--pretty much from the same circumstances as had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become apparent in Berlin--soldiers and gendarmerie</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pushed along to surround the Banque, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not venture closer than the north side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Place des Victoires on the north and on a line from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Palais Royal on the south. The police brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas-masks, with the same result as in Berlin. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">even brought up a wagonful of oxygen tubes, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they drove slowly up Rue des Bons Enfants, releasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gas as they went. But the driver of the camion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was overcome and switched off his engines before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were half-way up the street, and the crew was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected that nothing could be seen of what was hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening round the Banque. Meantime, there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">no delay in bringing up the air police, except for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time that had elapsed before the alarm was given. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">airship was seen-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" cried Lord Almeric, and I felt a thrill run up</seg><seg type="columnLine">my spine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was seen," said Sir Thomas again. "It: was</seg><seg type="columnLine">snuggled down on top of Rue Bailiff, hugging close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the buildings. The unfortunate thing is that both</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scouts who saw it developed engine trouble and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to come down. One almost crashed in the Palais</seg><seg type="columnLine">Royal Gardens--he hit a plane tree--but the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a good landing in the Place du Carrousel. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time the others came up, the airship was gone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">although the French and we have been scouring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air--searchlights and everything--not a single trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the airship has been discovered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What an unlucky thing that the engines of both</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines conked," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If both pilots hadn't been men of proved daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pluck," said Sir Thomas, "the inclination would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say they funked, for when the engines were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined, not a thing wrong could be found.

It is monstrous!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's pretty damnable," Sir Thomas agreed, rising as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke. "If the idea of the raiders is to bring busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness to a standstill, they are going the right way about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.

He must have sent out word of our departure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for we were not challenged. When we passed near</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, we invariably got a signal wishing us good</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck, and once or twice a voice came over the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone, which was in open circuit, with a, "Cheerio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merlin--keep your eyes skinned going over!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once above the open sea, I gave the pilot seat to Mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liken, and turned to read the English journals I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought with me.

The pity is that the management did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not introduce the surprise earlier in the evening, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking such elaborate measures to secure one big laugh.

In their haste to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be so wonderfully modest, they have almost an air of wishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to convey the impression that their efforts in the earlier part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening composed a serious attempt to reduce tne air</seg><seg type="columnLine">services of the country. That the St. Stephen's troupe has some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of right to discuss such an important matter cannot be</seg><seg type="columnLine">denied But if the troupe really was trying to discuss this</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious national question, and really was determined that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air service of the country should be reduced, in the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outrage on the Bank of England--which might readily have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been prevented by an adequate air patrol--their participation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the affair passes beyond a joke.

Later, when from a grey shape below</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, a white fleck parted, flickering in the sun, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience told us that the ship was a plane-carrier, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flickering speck one of her machines taking off.

Compared with the fastest</seg><seg type="columnLine">known machine, she was a streak of lightning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I will own that when I stepped ashore after the tests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was almost drunk with excitement, and Milliken was</seg><seg type="columnLine">little better. I was all impatience to hear the result</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my father's letter to the President, and I got through</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the old man on the phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was on the point of ringing you up, son," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but you've saved me the trouble. The President has</seg><seg type="columnLine">this minute left off speaking to me. He says he'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to see you at eleven o'clock to-morrow. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised him you'd be on the doorstep of the White</seg><seg type="columnLine">House right on time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine, dad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't tell you what he says to your proposition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was mighty flattering to your old dad.

You'll learn from him at dinner."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard him chuckle, but it was characteristic of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put up the receiver at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Presidential Conference</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT half-past nine next morning, the original Merlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">. took off with Milliken and two mechanics, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute or two later the new machine with myself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">another couple of men streaked after them, headed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington. We took it easy, and landed in the sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane basin of the Potomac just before half-past ten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Right at eleven I was standing on the doorstep of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">White House, never so nervous in my life. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped in and was giving my card to a servant, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white-haired little sturdy man came walking swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the passage to shake me warmly by the hand. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the President.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must be young James Boon," said he, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his watch. "Right on time. Glad to see you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come along to my workroom and tell me all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this wonderful machine of yours, and what's this free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lance policeman notion you have.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led me into a little room, furnished half as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and half as a library.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bless me I" said he. "And so you're Jimmy Boon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. Are you as good a man as your father?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not by miles, sir," said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! You might fall that short of him and yet be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good man," said the President. "Come, now. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">{ell me as quickly as you can all you know about these</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARK OF THE COVENANT	153</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">raids. They are a matter of grave concern to me. Sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">down--and shoot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Luckily, I had all the facts arranged in my head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for such a request, and I was able to give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pretty concise summary of all that lay within my</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge. While I was telling him, I had the oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity of taking in something of his personality. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged him to be hot-tempered, generous, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstinate. A difficult man to drive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "H'm!" said Mr. Whitcomb, when I had finished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You seem to have kept track of all the evidence there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, and to have been untiring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am glad to have from you the opinion of Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thomas Basildon and of Lord Almeric.

This is a very serious busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and the effects are already disastrous-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose to pace the room in impatient short steps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is a financial panic in London, Paris, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berlin--business is being brought to a standstill in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">those capitals, and the chaos is likely to spread. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cables this morning give cause for the deepest appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension. Where it will all end I cannot foresee. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">country has been swept from North to South without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any trace being revealed of these marauders, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canadian authorities report no favorable outcome of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the search of their territory. But we must keep on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost the country what it may. I can see no other help</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it. I agree that our only chance of running the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiders to earth is to be fully prepared for every emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gency, to be certain that no means of following the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest clue shall be neglected."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to me with a keen look, that yet passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over me as if to some greater audience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the deciding of what the country must do to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come such a terrible and bewildering menace," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I cannot see that anything is to be gained by sticking</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to rule and regulation.

I do not know from what point</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will make a start, but you may have the luck--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will venture that you have the intuition and skill--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">light upon some clue which will lead to the clearing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this mystery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His regard of me lost that absent air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said, with a smile, "don't thank me. Thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather your own proved value as a citizen.

He went to a side door and called.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Kirsteen!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in answer, Miss Torrance appeared at the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is your advocate, Mr. Boon," said the Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent.

He sent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">every kind message to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dear Uncle Almeric!

"We must see this wonderful Merlin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah! Half-past eleven. The Air Secretary and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">myrmidons should have arrived.' Get your wraps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirsteen, if you are coming. We must not keep them</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is the Merlin to be inspected at once--to-day?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked in surprise at this hustle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There will be some trouble if she isn't," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Secret Commission</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the new Merlin I took up two crack pilots and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a designer, while Milliken in the original machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried the President, Miss Torrance, and a bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Delaware Bay, and there I fooled with the new bus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing all the maddest stunts conceivable, until even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilots with me were, I believe, a bit scared. The speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machine had amazed the experts, but her quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb, that hovering flight of hers, and her astonishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualities in manceuvre astonished them still more. Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we were back on the banks of the Potomac and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the enthusiastic verdict of the authorities, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly evident that the Merlin design would pass to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the government at my own price.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I spent the afternoon in the offices of the Air Board,</seg><seg type="columnLine">going over the drawings of the machine and into costs</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the designers there. Meantime, Milliken and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanics had gone by rail to Gardiner Bay to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">back the other two new machines, which were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">purchased by the government. When I rejoined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President and Miss Torrance that evening for dinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the White House, I had in my pocket a bank draft</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the handsome price which was paid for the Merlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">design and the three new buses. The quick settling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deal was due to the President, and when he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Torrance and myself were alone after dinner, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to thank him. He put a hand on my shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a kindly way, shaking me, and tried to stop me</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, son," he said, "there no need for thanks. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought along your design just when it was most</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed, and we'd have been fools to let what Kirsteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">calls red-tape hinder the concluding of the bargain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We ought to thank you publicly for giving us such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a wonderful plane. But I have something for you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He produced an envelope and handed it to me. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a letter appointing me for special service with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air police, and mentioning Dan Lamont and Milli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ken as my assistants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turn back the front of your jacket," said Mr. Whit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comb. and when I did so he pinned a little silver badge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lining. It was the badge of the Secret Service.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There!" said he. "Now, in the morning at ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock you will go to this address." He handed me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">card on which a direction was pencilled. "You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to give your name to the doorman, and he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take you right to the man who nominally will be your</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief. Don't bother to ask his name. It is seldom the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same two days running. I want you to see him because</seg><seg type="columnLine">there may arise an occasion when it will be impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you to report direct to me, and in that case you</seg><seg type="columnLine">154	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">will report to him. Ordinarily, you are responsible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody but Ben Whitcomb.

Burn that card when you have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">memorized the address."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"1 can do that now, sir," said I, and dropped the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">card into the open fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good," said the President. "Take Lamont and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milliken with you to-morrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I shall have to get Dan Lamont on the phone right</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away, then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You'll find Dan Lamont at your hotel when you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">get back there to-night," said die President with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why--he's in New York!" I blurted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not at all," he laughed. "He's on his way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington. We phoned him to come right off, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed a room for him at your hotel. At least, my sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">retary did."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I turned to Miss Torrance, and it came to me that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she was just the prettiest girl I had ever seen. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a little faint flush on her cheeks, and her eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were shining. As if she were a little breathless with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some excitement, her lips were slightly parted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It's mighty kind of you, Miss Torrance," I mum-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bled, "to take so much trouble for me. I don't know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how to thank you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't try, please--it was Mr. Milliken-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Milliken!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Milliken and the Merlin--and, oh, the whole thing,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she cried. "You two and that lovely plane--and that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">modest little man, Mr. Lamont. I envy you, all four.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Next to being a man myself and joining you--the best</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing I could do was to see you got your chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You're lucky in your friends, Mr. Boon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I am that!" I said warmly. "Especially if I may</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">number you among them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then I felt my ears grow hot, and my neck go red</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at blurting this. It seemed so gauche after all she had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">done for me in friendship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That sounds ungrateful and silly," I stammered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I only wanted to hear it from you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">She was a little bit rosy herself, but she held out her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">small fist in a frank way, and her serene eyes looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right into mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Isn't that the American way?" she smiled. "To</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Shake on it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Sometimes," I said, and took her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'm green with envy at your luck," she said, "though</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you deserve it, every bit--but I'm with you and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crew of the Merlin, heart and soul."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That's just fine!" said I, and wished that kissing a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">girl's hand was still the fashion.

Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never reacned the floor," Milliken said, gazing a!</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. "Caught it without any noise.

Danny and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had noticed nothing about the chief--as the quiet man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the back street might be called--except that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed bored to death with the mere effort of living.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Flying Orders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next ten days passed slowly. Milliken and</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself were engaged in demonstrating the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merlin to the government flying-men, and at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time we had to oversee the refitting of the armament</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the old machine, with other alterations necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our campaign. Dan Lamont was kept busy col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lecting stores, and on his own account he was making</seg><seg type="columnLine">a selection of instruments which he thought might help</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in solving scientific problems connected with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With all three of us dead eager to be setting out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the delay was irksome, but we consoled ourselves that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were doing good work in putting the pilots wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the efficient use of the machines, and that in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">case it was better to wait for the next move on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the raiders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Merlin was fully ready for action by the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the week following our commission. The fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">top was fixed, and we had shipped all stores and am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munition. She carried four guns. We had dispensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with two of the smaller, so that we now mounted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore and aft guns firing half-kilo shells, and a machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun on either quarter. The arrangement was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Milliken or myself, whichever Of us happened to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">piloting, should handle the bow gun, while the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">should work that at the stern. Dan Lamont, if not</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied in scientific observation, was supposed to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention to the quarter guns, firing on the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">handiest in any encounter. Incidentally, he proved an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apt pupil under the instruction of Milliken and myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We arranged the ammunition bands for each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns with great care, so that there would be no hitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a crisis, and we put the spares where they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be handy for fitting at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dan made it his job to render us as immune from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raiders' gas as he knew how. On his advice, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid in a cylinder of oxygen, and fitted air-tight covers</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all openings. The gun embrasures we filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabric, double pleated like camera bellows, and pierced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take the barrels and telescopic sights and fitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly to them, but flexible enough to permit a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc of fire. The material was some close-woven as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bestos stuff of Dan's own choosing, and he said it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not only keep out the gas, but would resist the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat of the gun-barrels after heavy firing. Our gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral idea was that should we get into action with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiders we should immediately close all apertures, turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a thin stream of oxygen, and do our fighting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hermetically sealed cabin, a quicklime apparatus ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbing the carbon-dioxide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dan also had caused to be fitted under the hatch a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle arrangement for automatically taking a sample</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gas, should we get into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the fortnight in Washington we freguently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">met Kirsteen Torrance, and her uncle, the President,</seg><seg type="columnLine">less often. She was inclined at first to think us a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifle slack about getting down to business, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President persuaded her that we were doing the right--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and harder--thing in waiting. Kirsteen took a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in our preparations and was often in the Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin's shed. She renewed her acquaintance with Milli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ken, who greeted her every appearance with his widest</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin and delighted to explain to her the smallest detail'</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our outfit. We thought of her as our mascot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had an idea that the next of the raids would</seg><seg type="columnLine">most likely come on the Great Lakes, and we decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if we got no news by the evening of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday in May, we should make a hit-or-miss start for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Buffalo end of Lake Erie on Monday morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">News came- to Washington by radio, however, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrapped our plan at once. Dan and I were having</seg><seg type="columnLine">tea with Miss Torrance at the White House, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President came into the room with a flimsy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Flying orders, boys," he said.

We had to climb high</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we got out of a heavy driving rain, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had avoided that we came into electrical disturb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances that played the very devil with our compass. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tricky and difficult flying, for the lightning flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">above and below us, dazzlingly brilliant, and the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere was terribly pocketed, so that we pancaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a most sickening fashion. The smash of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder-clouds was deafening. There were times when</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the fact that Milliken was standing on his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuaded me that we were not flying upside down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The disturbed area must have covered ten degrees of</seg><seg type="columnLine">longitude, for we were in it close on two hours. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, however, we passed out of the storm belt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the stars, and we were more sure of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">course as a consequence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Milliken and I spelled each other every two hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Dan, once the interest of the storm was over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept peacefully. It was bright day when we sighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Azores, though our clock showed only half-past</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. Three hours later we were swaying gently on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swell in the very exposed Bay of Funchal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Milliken cooked breakfast on the gasoline stove, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a visit from the port authorities Dan and I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">156	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore. We could get no official information about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raids that was worth considering. The Portugese</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem to care a red cent about the stopped liners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had better luck at Bland/s, where Englishmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were three acts ot piracy on the Sunday, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Union-Castle liners and one belonging to the R. M.</seg><seg type="columnLine">S. P. Co. being the victims. In each case the strong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms had been the objective, specie being taken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all three ships, and from a Union-Castle liner, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was homeward bound, the raiders had made a consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erable haul in diamonds. The method of attack was</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar on each ship: a sudden descent from the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the airship, swift and unexpected, and almost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately the anesthetizing of every soul aboard, close</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a brief period of terrible panic among the passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crew. This last was a ghastly feature which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been missing from the night raids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a week, the weather being fine enough to per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit a stay in the exposed harbor, we made Funchal</seg><seg type="columnLine">our base, and we haunted the shipping routes from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast of Spain to the Cape Verde Islands. But we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not the luck to sight our quarry. The following</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday, while we were making towards the Azores,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we intercepted a radio which told of raids on the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantic shipping. We filled our tanks at San Miguel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cast a wide circle north into the sea lanes, flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">until dawn on the Monday morning, without result.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We returned to the Azores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came to Dan Lamont and myself simultaneously</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these very islands would make an ideal base for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the known operations of the raiders, a notion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to hit all the international searchers a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">later. The seaplane base began to fill with British,</seg><seg type="columnLine">French, American, and German machines, until by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the week there was hardly mooring room for</seg><seg type="columnLine">another bus. Meantime, Dan and I had gone ashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">to test the Aunt Mandy's Soap scheme. We bought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">packet, and sure enough made the acquaintance of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert young American who had an office in a quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">back street. We did not need to introduce ourselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He greeted us by name as soon as he saw us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We enlisted his help for a search of the Azores,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and while his dago myrmidons scoured the land, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined every nook and cranny from the air. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised no game whatever. Altogether, we spent an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fruitless week in the Azores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here," the distributor of soap said finally.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's a dandy landing-place for an airship on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madeira. I've just remembered it. A plateau, Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows how many feet up, towards the west end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island. They call it the Paul da Serra--a barren place</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is--utterly deserted. I'd give that the once-over, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I were you. I think you're on a false trail in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular group of islands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, we were just sick of the sight of all that un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">used ammunition in the cockpit of the Merlin, and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">soap friend's description of the Paul da Serra cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly did make it look like an attractive landing-place</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an airship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was nearly a fortnight since we had left Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington, May was more than half over, and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still short of the fight we wanted. Anyhow, a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope seemed better to us than none, so we made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Funchal once again, with the intention of flying over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plateau on the early morning of the next day--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday, it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As luck would have it, this was the time chosen by</seg><seg type="columnLine">ffie Merlin for her first breakdown. It was noth-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing much, just a fleck of enamel stuck, by some chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the jet of one of the carburetors. We could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">flown all right, but Milliken and I did not want to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with two cylinders missing. The locating of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble was enough to delay our start until long past</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn. It was seven o'clock before we got over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau and, as will be shown later, that fleck of enamel</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost us an excellent chance. The Paul da Serra was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare when we flew over it--but it had been occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">not an hour and a half before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the merest chance that sent tis northward</seg><seg type="columnLine">on patrol, for we had considered another flight to Cape</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verde Islands. But northward we went. There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">some would say we were urged by fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Battle at Last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUR northward course had lasted barely half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, when far below and ahead of us there</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened out a situation that had about it more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of drama.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Broadside to our path lay a liner, spick and span to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smallest detail in the clear air of the summer morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but so far away as to be a miniature ship. Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">nestling on her tall masts there hovered the long silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape of an airship 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dan and Milliken were doing small chores in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin behind me, and I found myself calling them--</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow in a whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Christopher, old man," Dan breathed, "we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got 'em at last I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Milliken's only comment was to pull the breech-cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">off my gun and set the belt of shells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep high, sir," he muttered, when that was done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and drop on them--quick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the idea," I whispered. "Close all open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. Action as rehearsed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He and Dan quickly cleared for action, while I gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine as much gas as it would take. The Merlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">leapt forward at dizzying speed. And now we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we had previously missed, that we were not alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our hurry to the scene. From the east raced a war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, a plane-carrier we could see from her forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform, and British from the fleck of white and red</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her peak. Her distance from the liner could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been more than sixteen kilometres, and the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">surge at her stem and bows showed how quickly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance was being covered. Neither the airship nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruiser, I felt certain, had spotted the Merlin. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruiser sent up a plane, we would have to be spry</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get in the first shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stations, boys I" I yelled, then, for I saw the airship</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin to rise from the masts of the liner. "I'll dive</seg><seg type="columnLine">below her, Milliken. Burst her as we pass below!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, aye, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down, down, down we streaked--quicker than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">kestrel swooped. My shoulder was snugged in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of the gun, and my finger was trembling at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger. Up, up, up to meet us came the mass of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airship till her side loomed like a great wall. I flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened then, and every fibre of the Merlin protested at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strain. Suddenly my gun blatted as of its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">volition. I could just glimpse the gouts of flame as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shells burst in the grey side of the airship, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had to dive under her--then behind me I heard Milli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ken's gun give voice in a prolonged roar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The enemy must have risen quickly, for I found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merlin still a good height above the level of the sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The speed of the dive--done with the engine almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARK OF THE COVENANT	157</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">full throttle--took us far beyond our quarry, since I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not turn without depriving Milliken of his shot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I pressed the foot-bar for the turn, and Danny loosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">off excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold your fire, Danny 1" I yelled. "We're not near</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hell, Jimmy!" he shouted. "Gimme a chance, will</seg><seg type="columnLine">you I"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite my climbing turn, we had lost the level of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rising dirigible and we now had to climb at a steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle, but I set the Merlin to the task, all out. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered willingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> High above us floated the silent grey shape of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airship, and it seemed as if she were disdainful of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst we could do her. No answering burst of fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to us, no sign that anyone moved on her. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was uncannily still. It was amazing that she still could</seg><seg type="columnLine">float level, for at least three of my shells had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect on her envelope, and Milliken was not the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to expend ammunition unless his target was plumb on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cross-hairs of his gun-sight. But she floated hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zontally, rising quickly, apparently unharmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were gaining on her, I thought, but the angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">at which we had to climb seemed likely to take us clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">under her, so I gave her a burst of shells before turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spiral. As we came round, Danny's gun stuttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">out long roll--it must have been nearly a drumful--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently Milliken's heavier metal took up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground bass of the chorus, till the cabin was clamorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the roar, through which came the thin tinkle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent shells falling. Still no answer came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the spiral brought us round so that the grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape filled the field of my gun-sight again I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice that the ship floated in a thin pinkish haze that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shimmered, as one sometimes will see the heat do as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it rises from a hillside in summer. It was a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect, curious enough to hold my attention even in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement of that moment, and I called Danny's atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to it before opening fire on the target. But as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed the trigger, the haze enveloped the Merlin her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and a sort of dancing refraction spoiled my aim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wonder if that haze has anything to'do with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas?" said Dan in my ear as we swung round once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, and he added something that was drowned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise of Milliken's gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just at that moment, to my intense disgust, tha en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine of the Merlin, which had been working beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, gave a despairing whine and petered out. I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bus slip back, and I flipped up her tail so that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into a head dive. As we came down the engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up and failed once or twice in an odd fashion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">till at last--when I had got the bus into her steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovering descent--it stopped altogether. We alighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the face of the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once Milliken sprang for the engine hatch, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dan Lamont seized him by the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't open anything yet, Milliken!" he yelled. "Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet--we're still in the haze. It might be the gas!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gas--hell!" said Milliken. "I want to see what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to the engine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jimmy!" Danny cried in distress, as the mechanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently put him aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a moment, Milliken," I intervened. "Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">think this thing out--Mr. Lamont may be right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right, sir," said Milliken, and stood aside at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Escape</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE pinkish haze lay about us as we rode the sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the north of us the liner still wallowed in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">troughs, and the British cruiser was coming up hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">over fist from the east. The airship floated motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sky to the south of us, seemingly none the worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our attack, nor making any attempt to get away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My glance fell on the clock attached to the control-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mighty!"

If this haze is what I think it is, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't open anything for long without _ being doped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is what I say. It's damned unscientific--but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't believe in tests even on white mice.

If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">keel over, shut the port quick and bung my nose up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the oxygen tube, and leave me to recover. That</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">will be enough if I don't show signs of choking-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was taken aback at having to sanction such a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeding, but there was no time to argue the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're O.

Is that the order?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Sure it is," said Dan, a little breathlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right," I said. "If I didn't think--I pray God</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it's nothing worse than the usual gas-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see why they should change their tactics</seg><seg type="columnLine">now," said Dan. "If I don't come round, try the ether</seg><seg type="columnLine">injections I showed you. Stand by, boys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went quickly to a porthole and undid the screw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then swung the cover aside and stuck his head out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the ga--gas--allri--" he muttered with a funny</seg><seg type="columnLine">little smile. Then he seemed to crumple, and I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he fell. Milliken whipped the cover back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">its place and threw in the fastener, while I gently laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend down with his fair head against the oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">nozzle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether it was seeing Dan keel over in that fashion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or that Milliken and I got a whiff of the gas, I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to gauge, but we both had the symptoms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being pretty sick. I know that when my mechanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to fetch a pillow to put under Dan's head, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled and went white, while I was as dizzy-headed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be. Dan was breathing quietly and, despite our</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety, there seemed no need to inject ether or try</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial respiration as he had showed us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pluck, if you like, sir," Milliken muttered, and.</seg><seg type="columnLine">very gently he lifted Dan's head and put the pillow</seg><seg type="columnLine">under it. That was all we could do, for Dan's shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">collar was open and his clothing loose. We made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little fellow as comfortable as we could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were just rising to our feet, Milliken and I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the cabin shook to a distant thud. A wispy ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke was drifting from one of the barbette guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cruiser, and, as we watched, a string of bunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">was broken out on her signal halyard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" said Milliken. "TTiere's a plane up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure enough, while we had been attending to Dan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruiser had catapulted one of her machines into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, and it already was climbing after the airship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reel out the aerial, Milliken," I said. "We might</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick up a message or something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I switched into the open receiver as he let the wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, then we watched the progress of the fight. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">158	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">aeroplane was climbing steadily and cleverly after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirigible, which was making no attempt to get away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as the pink haze still lay about the enemy, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the men in the open machine would be doped</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they could attack. I sprang to the radio to</seg><seg type="columnLine">warn them if I could--for the aerial was a bit short</seg><seg type="columnLine">foi* sending, since we were afloat--but just then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">message came belting across the phone:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His Britannic Majesty's ship Brilliant to the damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirate: Surrender I" came the voice.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the sound came, and we heard the warning go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cruiser, we saw the plane enter the fringe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the haze. Only for a second after that was it under</seg><seg type="columnLine">control. It stalled, then got into a spinning nosedive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">righting just before it crashed flat into the sea.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoisted both men into the cabin of the Merlin, and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads against the nozzle of the oxygen cylinder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we went on the second machine, a big, amphibious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-engined de Hamiville fighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here the crew were in better case.

The air me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanics of the ship took charge of Milliken, and Danny</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I were besieged by the commissioned officers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">doped airmen were still unconscious when they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken from our cabin, and, on Danny's advice, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surgeon ordered the sick-bay stewards to put the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bed to sleep off the effects of the gas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cruiser, meantime, had come alongside the liner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in an excellent display of seamanship had grappled</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. It was the Parnassic all over again, Sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">people were huddled about her decks, nor could any</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts of the boarding-party bring them to conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. It was decided to take the liner in tow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madeira, and the bluejackets quickly bent a cable from</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship to ship. By the time Dan and I had stepped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wardroom for breakfast, the liner was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged astern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At breakfast we had a long discussion with the sail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and flying officers, and we were brought to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion that the raiders had, in addition to the gas, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret means of disturbing the engines of planes. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the evidence of the two machines forced to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in the raid on Paris, these, it will be remembered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the Merlin and the big de Hamiville, showing no</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasting engine trouble. Dan's theory was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiders had a ray which affected the electrical circuits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the engines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He also had an idea that the raiders had some way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of controlling their cloud of anesthetizing gas, a notion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was supported by the officers who had been watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the show from the cruiser's fire-control top. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink haze had moved about from position to position</seg><seg type="columnLine">in too definite a manner to be haphazard, and Dan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officers were of the opinion that the gas had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposely swept from the vicinity of the Merlin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dan, while the discussion was forward, was back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his old trick of shaking loose change in his cupped</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, but from this demonstration of his interest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement he drifted into a mood of silent cogitation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which deepened the wrinkles above his snub nose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him the air of a thoughtful child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After breakfast. Milliken and I went over the Merlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a general overhaul, and found her none the worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her Straining. We took off from the deck of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser just before nine o'clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where now?" asked Danny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mogador," said I. "We owed the raiders a start</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their humanity. They certainly play a clean game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ARK OF 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It would have been easy for them to have left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merlin in irons with their gas. But we're going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have another cut at them. First, we must refill our</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks at Mogador, and get a message radioed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station there to the President and to Sir Thomas</seg><seg type="columnLine">Basildon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Jimmy," Dan objected.

How are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to get over that ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not quite sure," said I. "I think the notion is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get well above them, then it doesn't matter whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine is stopped or not--a glide will do all that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">required. Next time, I'm not going to waste ammuni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on the envelope--they're using some uninflammable</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas--that's plain. I'm going straight for the stern</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines.

Especially the lower street, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was built for pedestrians only. Here, the wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">window displays, the bright lights of the theatres, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stores, and dining-rooms added their brilliancy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the countless electrical lights of all colors and patterns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and attracted the crowds from all parts of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. It was the White Way of the mighty metropolis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The heavy traffic assigned to the second level, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely be heard from below, due to the excellent sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vibration-proof construction of the streets. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">present street system was a great improvement over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old style of having everything on one level. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">now merchandise was delivered to the buildings by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sub-surface freight railway, that connected all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main buildings, and provided them with an efficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of receiving and shipping the constant streams</seg><seg type="columnLine">of material.

Wallace noticed his companion steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">another look at the wrist watch as they approached a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner table furthest from the entrance. He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">what curious contraption that innocent-looking wrist</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch could be, and how it could inform the wearer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of a spy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We can sit here and talk," Riel remarked removing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat, "but keep off the robbery subject, for we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only being watched but overheard as well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The official gazed uneasily around him at the occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied tables, but no one seemed to be paying the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of attention to them. He almost decided that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend was taking the precautions simply as a measure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of safety, and that he had no proof of any one shadow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them. But, then, that mysterious wrist watch must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be serving some purpose; and he tried to puzzle out</seg><seg type="columnLine">how a wrist watch could be fixed up to tell of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of a person who is close enough to overhear</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What makes you think we are being watched?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.	-&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't think so I know it, see this on my wrist?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the detective exhibited the watch for inspection. "It's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a wrist watch, yes, but the second hand is not a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, it's a small compass needle.

When no energy is passing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coil the compass needle will swing free--controlled</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly by the magnetic lines of the earth. Now I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you something that I have not told you before, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandits--''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Riel's serious expression quickly changed to a smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Wallace again saw the warning look in his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So for the next few minutes they talked idly, remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off the subject of interest. Wallace was not slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">in catching on, he knew that in some way the watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated the presence of a foe. But who or where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spy was he had no idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The detective's arm was resting on the table, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch almost concealed by his cuff, but not enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide the compass needle from view. The needle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing straight at the stem of the watch, or the figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve, with its north pole. But another look from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleuth caused Wallace to take his glance away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the needle. He noticed that his friend looked at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the corner of his eye, while he carried on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation. Suddenly the needle was released, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung freely around as it sought to align itself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magnetic north and south poles of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must give you credit," Riel smiled across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, "you were not slow in catching on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose you let me know what the mystery is,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the reply, "before that confounded thing swings</seg><seg type="columnLine">around again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, they're using a vision ray on us, and this de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tects the ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wallace's face paled.

Above all he was concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with what they had to do with the raids on his air</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The International Air Line had the swiftest trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atlantic transportation system in the world, connecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The long distance flights were made at a high alti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude--the gigantic triple-deck planes being automatically</seg><seg type="columnLine">guided along magnetic beams at an amazing speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The landing stations were built on, or rather sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended between, four gigantic steel towers forming a</seg><seg type="columnLine">square. Built near the top of these, the station con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted of two runways, or landing tracks, with a section</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the station rising up on each side of them, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">third projection between the two tracks. The three</seg><seg type="columnLine">sections were of equal height and the roofs perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat and level; for the huge wings of the ships passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over them, clearing the flat tops at a close margin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whole station structure when viewed from above</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembled a huge wide letter "E," lying on its back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held up in the air by four long legs. The three</seg><seg type="columnLine">station sections running the length of the runways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were each three floors above the tracks, and each con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected with them by three landing platforms, one above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. The section of the station, located between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tracks, was used by the cruisers in both runways</seg><seg type="columnLine">for discharging passengers and baggage, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer buildings served to load the liners in their respec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive runways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The upper deck of the liner held the first-class pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger cabins, the front end of which consisted of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">observation compartment. Here, large, low windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a half circle around the front of the deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">offering an excellent view of things below, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ships, during the long flights, usually flew at such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a height that there was little to see during the trip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The entire deck, with its luxurious furnishings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trimmings, its comfortable sleeping cabins and faultless</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining service, offered all the comforts and accommo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dations of a first-class hotel. Connection with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decks below was established by means of a noiseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor selector or elevator; while a second elevator con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected the dining room with the kitchen on the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. The second or intermediate deck of the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers held the second-class compartments, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped somewhat similar to the first-class section</seg><seg type="columnLine">above. The lower floor contained the baggage rooms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew's quarters, operating and control rooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The triple-floor station platforms running along both</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of the two runways, served to connect the baggage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and waiting rooms of the station, with their respective</seg><seg type="columnLine">liner decks. Off the two upper platforms the ticket</seg><seg type="columnLine">offices and waiting rooms were located, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage and supply rooms were on the level of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower Ioading-platforms. Guide rails passed along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer edges of the loading platforms, and small rollers</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ships engaged these rails, guiding them through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station; while skids or projecting strips on the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom of the cruisers slid into slots in the bed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">runway that were fitted with rollers, reducing friction</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a minimum. This was of great benefit in starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from the station, enabling the hydraulic catapult</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give the cruiser the necessary speed to leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">runway. The smooth, quick stop of the liners was</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished by means of hydraulic brakes placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the platform edges, just above the guide rails.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These brakes, when applied against strips of special</seg><seg type="columnLine">material on the sides of the cruisers, were capable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly stopping them, even when they entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station at a high speed. But there was little variation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the landing speed, for the ships, when approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the station, were automatically guided in by a magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing beam. These beams, similar to the* ones used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to guide the liners over their routes, were set at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">level with the runways, and not only enabled them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hit the runways accurately, but also adjusted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five powerful, high-speed electric motors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted on each wing and connected directly to indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual control panels' in the control room. Therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if one motor went out of order during flight, it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cut out of service by the operator without inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fering with the others. The power was furnished by</seg><seg type="columnLine">twin generators, each driven individually by a gasoline</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine, and each set capable of operating the ship inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendently in case the other developed trouble. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete power system was such that there was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">little chance of a forced landing being caused by engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A group of colored signal-lights was located on</seg><seg type="columnLine">both upper and lower sides of each wing, while another</seg><seg type="columnLine">group was attached on the nose or front end. All of'</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were controlled from the operating room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ready to Start</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE location of the control or operating room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the front part of the lower deck. The compli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated mass of automatic electrical control equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was mounted on a number of slate panels, forming</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arc which extended from the front of the operator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">around on both sides. The panels were about two feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the floor and about four feet high, leaving room</seg><seg type="columnLine">below for the hand and foot levers of the emergency</seg><seg type="columnLine">manual control. Directly in the center of the panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">board was a number of meters. The largest was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity meter controlled by the speed indicator which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was attached to the outside of the ship. The velocity</seg><seg type="columnLine">control was operated by the' automatic radio control,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its speed setting by the altitude regulator, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was adjusted to operate when the meter reading was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain point. This made it possible to keep the altitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">control unit accurately timed, which was an important</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. On the right of the meter panel, was the auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic radio control, consisting chiefly of a large num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of electro-magnets, fixed coils and sensitive relays.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the liner entered the field of one of the magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams, the automatic radio control was thrown into</seg><seg type="columnLine">164	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">action by the beam, and automatically kept the craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center, or densest part, of the beam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Mr. Wallace stepped from the elevator after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rapid ascent to the I. A. L. station, and entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting rooms of the eastbound track, he found his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here so soon?" was Riel's greeting. "Well, we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got almost twenty minutes to wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, the special should be here soon, because I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered it for 5.45."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as he spoke, a bell rang and the train announcer</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit up:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> SPECIAL 47L N. Y.-LONDON. O T. 5.45.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"On time," added the official, looking up at the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncer. "It must be coming in on the landing beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How far out from the station does the landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam extend ?" the sleuth asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ten miles. Our landing beam projectors are lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated below the runways here. One beam is thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">east from the westbound tracks, the other extends the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same distance west to guide the eastbound ships in."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But when the ships leave the upper beam and drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, entering the landing beam, is this done by</seg><seg type="columnLine">manual or automatic means?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Automatic," replied Wallace. "We have a beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing the upper one at a certain distance out, approxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mately thirty miles from here or twenty from the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the landing beam. When the ship hits this cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam the radio control is thrown out of contact, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">causes the velocity regulating unit to also throw out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutting off the motors, while the altitude regulator is</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown into its lower setting, which is the height of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing beam. The liner then glides down at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable angle until it enters the lower beam. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">the altitude regulator rights it, and the beam causes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radio control to operate and throw in the velocity</seg><seg type="columnLine">unit, but in a lower speed setting. The motors drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruiser along the lower beam at a greatly reduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, guided automatically by the radio control."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sounds all rights," Riel answered, "but what pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision have you made for failure of the ship to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower beam?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have the ship equipped with a complete installa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of manual control equipment, by which the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">can lower the landing wheels and bring the craft to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency landing fields in case the automatic equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment fails; and as to missing the lower beam when</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming down, that is almost impossible. For with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser going at a definite speed and in a definite direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and the decline started at a certain point, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy to see that it will arrive within a reasonable dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance of the beam area. Of course, the air currents</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw it out some, but the pilot can easily make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight adjustments necessary by the use of the manual</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls. For the area in which the ships strike the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower beam is well marked by day and plainly illumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated by night. The liners also carry a special radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam indicating unit, used when the weather makes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guiding lights invisible. But suppose we step out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform, our ship should be here by now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The huge cruiser could be seen approaching about</seg><seg type="columnLine">two miles west, on a level with the station, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely more than two minutes before she entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">runway, sliding in between the guide rails with amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing accuracy, and coming to a quick but smooth stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To one who had never seen the air liners enter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the station, it was indeed an interesting sight to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">watch the approach of the huge triple-deck cruiser with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its monstrous wings. But once inside the station, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a partial view of it could be seen from one place. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the platforms passing close to the sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, only one deck could be seen from any one plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form or waiting room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no crew on this ship except one operator,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the official informed his friend, as they stepped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper compartment. "We are carrying nothing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of baggage, and I left even the kitchen crew be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind, to be sure that we would not be disturbed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip. But I have a lunch here in my hand-bag in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">we get hungry before arriving."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your precautions were hardly necessary," smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the detective, "but nevertheless it is just as well, for we</seg><seg type="columnLine">know who is aboard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scarcely had they seated themselves, than the doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the three decks slid shut, the hydraulic brakes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">released with a hiss and the huge craft was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly pushed down the runway by the powerful cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pult, gaining speed at an amazing pace. A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later it was cruising free of the landing station. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship left the runway, a pressure contact on the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">was released automatically, throwing the altitude con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol unit into operation in its high setting. Simultane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously the velocity regulator was automatically thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">into contact, and the motors were soon pulling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster rapidly up towards the higher altitudes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ready for a Hold-Up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE oxygen distributing system was already in use</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the ship, relieving the difficulty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing in the thin upper atmosphere. The gradual</seg><seg type="columnLine">leveling of the liner indicated its approach to the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic beam, and as the altitude regulator cut out, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam caused the automatic radio control to make con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact, throwing the velocity regulator into its high speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting. Under its control the battery of motors began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to increase speed, until the cruiser was heading cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the amazing speed of four hundred miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you notice any disturbance on your wrist watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we were in the station?" Riel asked, as the cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained speed along the beam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, for the time being I forgot about it," was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply. "Do you expect them to stop us this time?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, I do." Riel shook his head. "I expect them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring us down before we get over. It is an ideal</seg><seg type="columnLine">day for them, dull and cloudy, making it easy for them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I doubt it," Wallace said. "I've got extra police</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the job to-day, just hoping they will make a try,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the pilot has been told to sound the radio alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">as soon as he finds the ship leaving the beam."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When did you give these instructions, when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered the special?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I phoned the air sheds from my office and also</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave orders to have the radio alarm inspected care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, and the pilot well instructed as to its use."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And how many pilots have set off the alarm during</seg><seg type="columnLine">a robbery?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quiet," hissed Riel, as he saw the needle of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sptch freeze stiff, "I'll take the papers from my brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">case," he continued in a natural voice, "and hide them</seg><seg type="columnLine">under my seat in case we're held up. Can't run the</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk of losing them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later the needle swung freely, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were free to talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"What was your idea of talking about hiding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PLANET'S AIR MASTER	165</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">papers?" Wallace asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just to prove to you that they are able to hear us</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as see us. There is no doubt but what we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be brought down, and to prove my words you'll find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the raiders will look under the cushion of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, before searching my case, although we will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the papers under the chair cushions. But you</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't answered my last question yet.

"In fact only two pilots made use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it at all during robberies and those times were after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raiders had thoroughly robbed the liners and left."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And on another occasion one of your police plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">escorts left the liner and flew off on a false chase of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raiders, while the ship was brought down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Wallace nodded. "Of course we can hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame the police, if they see-a chance to chase the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiders. But there is one instance where the bandits</seg><seg type="columnLine">used two planes, one as a decoy to lead the police away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other to rob the ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No; you are wrong, Wallace, for I know that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are using but one ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Impossible!" insisted the official indignantly, "for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police chased the raider over one hundred miles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as soon as they lost sight of it they returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser. That plane could not have got back and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted the robbery before the police returned."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now listen," Riel bent over towards his companion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'd like to tell you all I know about this case and</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain some of these things for you; but to do so</seg><seg type="columnLine">would most positively spoil my plans, but later you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will know.

The radio instruments of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane are affected when the machine passes through it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the reception of radio messages is disturbed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray's magnetic action."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you know where the beam is coming from."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We have a very good idea of its location, yes. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exact spot is not known."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then why don't you trace it down with your planes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it's so easy to follow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That has been tried, yes, tried too often before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered the power the man held over the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean that the ray contains some deadly ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that is fatal to anyone passing through it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, the vision ray is harmless in itself, otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and I would be dead, for we have had it on us</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than once. We are able to follow the ray; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">few that have tried it have lived to tell of their experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences. The first attempt was made by your own gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment, who thought someone was illegally using a</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio beam for wireless signals. A plane was sent out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to trace the ray down, and it has not been heard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">since."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably shot down by the raiders when they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Wallace, it wasn't shot down. A deadlier</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon was used on the plane before it got within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred miles of the wizard's base. The next attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to trace the vision ray was made by the New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Bureau after the robberies of your liners</seg><seg type="columnLine">started. You remember where the wreck of their police</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane was found next day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there must be an explanation: those ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't fall down without a reason, surely the wizard</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't do all this with hundreds of miles between him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his foes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A little later," continued the detective, "the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to be coupled with the raids on your air cruisers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was kept a close secret by the police. Scotland</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yard sent two swift well-armed planes to search for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray. They picked it up at noon the next day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed it southwest. They never returned. The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines suddenly turned on each other and fought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly gun duel to the death. One went down in flames</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other flew a few miles south and suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">without warning swooped downward, diving straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the ocean with engines roaring at full speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another time an unofficial adventurer was seen follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the ray by one of our planes. He was cruising</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, not over one hundred miles an hour when to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror of the observing plane he leaped from his ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the ocean below, followed closely by his uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled plane. Orders have been given to all ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">police to allow no one to follow the beam when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes on the air."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then the ray must drive its victims mad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The vision ray itself is harmless, but something else</seg><seg type="columnLine">is being used with it, possibly another ray. Now we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop the subject until we reach London, then we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">try and find a way to deal with the situation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of the fact that he would have liked to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">more about the case, Wallace decided that it was best</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain quiet and wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Riel Gives Some Orders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DARKNESS was settling over the land when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the transatlantic beam and coasted gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the area of the landing beam. And it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a few minutes more before the cruiser came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth stop in the London station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, here we are," Riel remarked, rising from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat. "Now we'll probably be trailed by the ray, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">be careful what you say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving the ship they stood on the platform a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watched the special leave. There were perhaps a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen persons standing around, most of them waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Paris liner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll go up to the offices and have a talk with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">London manager," the detective said as they passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the waiting room. "I called him from New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, so he will be waiting for us. Then we will go</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to my place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A speedy elevator soon brought the two men down</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PLANET'!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the subterranean railway entrance and while they</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited, for a train, Riel glanced around at the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">as was his custom, taking no special look at any one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but noticing a surprising number of things in each</seg><seg type="columnLine">casual glance. There was a large crowd on the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, for it was the evening rush hour, when the city's</seg><seg type="columnLine">factories and skyscrapers were pouring their thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the streets. A workman in overalls with a dinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucket in his hand, stood behind the pair. He received</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second glance from the detective, but whether it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he was standing in a place that looked suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious, or whether the sleuth was just checking up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see if he was following them was hard to say. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman standing near them also received a brief un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed look from Riel. He was apparently taking no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances of being followed. A train pulled in and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of humanity started toward the entrance. Man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aging to squeeze into the train, the two men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliged to stand in the aisle. The man with the dinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucket was near them, but Riel paid little attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; he apparently had satisfied himself with the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance on the platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Is this the kind of transportation you use in your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">travels about the city?" Wallace asked, nodding to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">car packed tight with its human cargo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, not as a rule," was the answer. "I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">apologize for bringing you on this crowded car, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it to prevent being followed. We can lose a spotter</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier in a crowd than by using street or air taxis</seg><seg type="columnLine">which can be followed easily. I can't afford to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone follow us V&gt;-night, for I am taking you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I have the plans that our criminal wizard is</seg><seg type="columnLine">after, and I can not take a chance on being trailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Those papers are important."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Leaving the subway after a twenty-minute ride, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men walked along the lower street level to the Empire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Building, taking an elevator to the forty-seventh floor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where the offices of the London I. A. L. branch was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">located.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is best that I do the talking," Riel warned his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">companion as they entered the manager's office. "I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will explain later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The detective needed no introduction to Edward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Graham, manager of the London offices, for he had had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">interviews with the official before, during his work on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the present case. So, witfe little more than a nod to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the man at the desk, he at once approached the subject</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I want to take a special liner back to New York</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to-morrow at ten in the morning. I will put on a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">disguise and slip onto the liner in the sheds, and take</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my place in the control room as an electrical tester. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you can put some new equipment on the control panels</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the special, it will look more natural."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I think I can arrange it all right, providing Mr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wallace offers no objection."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No objection whatever, Mr. Graham, You are to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">assist Mr. Riel in every possible way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, then," replied the manager, turning to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sleuth, "will you be carrying any baggage?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I wish to get a package of valuable papers to New</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">York, and we'll have it secreted onto the liner in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sheds. It is not likely well be stopped this trip, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they got false plans from us before; and they'll think</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this trip is also a bluff. Even if they do learn of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shipment through spies watching the special, they will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only see two men in the control room making a test</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. flight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All right Mr. Riel," replied the London I. A. L.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AIR MASTER	167</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">official, "I'll have the ship ready on time. I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will attend to putting your package on board?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," replied the detective, preparing to leave, "I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">attend to that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving the office, the two ascended to the roof and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">signalling for an air taxi, were soon traveling to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything worked Eke a charm," Riel exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with satisfaction looking'at his watch for signs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray. "Just as I expected, the ray was on us all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time we were in the office, and our master criminal will</seg><seg type="columnLine">play into my hands this time. But we had better main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain silence until we are more secure from the wizard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single word may spoil all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was with difficulty that Wallace could keep quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he was bursting with curiosity. A score of ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions were burning in his brain. Why was Riel going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to return to America? Did he really hope to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">across with some valuables to see if it could be done?</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, there must be more to it than that. No doubt he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made up that talk because the ray was on them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and intended to make a far different move. But if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was intending to make the trip, why would he tempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the criminals to another robbery? Could he learn any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing by it? Was the package going to contain any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of real value or would it be another fake set of</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers? Could the ray penetrate the package to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was in it and so possibly beat Riel at his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Over London</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUCH thoughts ran through the American's brain as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the taxiplane continued west along the city landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">level. But he could see plainly that his companion did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not care to discuss the subject, so he gave it up, deciding</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wait until they had a chance to talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The progress of the taxi was slow along the landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">lane, for planes were continually coming up or going</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to landing places below. Building roofs, garage</seg><seg type="columnLine">roofs, individual landings and the many municipal park-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing spaces, all added their share of craft to the crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower lane. But it was not long before the chauffeur</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached an ascent cross-lane, which was commonly</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the "A" lane. The "A" lane signal, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge green and white revolving light mounted on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel tower, was visible for a long distance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. The "D" lane or descent cross-lane signals were</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to the others, only that a red and white light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The taxiplane arriving over the "A" lane signal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascended to its proper level, passing above the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">lane which was assigned to heavy duty craft. Reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Lane 3 which was composed of local light traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">it again resumed its flight to the west. Once on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third lane, the plane speeded up and cut through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air at a fast rate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heavy traffic of Lane 2 swept past below in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuous stream, momentarily blotting out partial</seg><seg type="columnLine">views of the illuminated city below. As far as the eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">could detect the land was a continuous stretch of lights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Millions of them of all imaginable sizes and colors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The extra bright strips, stretching for miles across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black background, indicated the main streets. The re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volving cross-lane signals could be seen scattered at</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals over the city--the traffic signals of the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveler. The lanes below appeared as an endless</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of red lights, as the heavy traffic of the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanes swept past, the red lights on the upper side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wings standing out bright and dear against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">168	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">darker background of the plane. It was a remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrast to the view of the through lane above, show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only the green lights of the lower sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings. The sky was cloudless but no moon was visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to flood with its light the landscape. But a plain view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the land below was not essential to safe air travel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the altitude indicators told the flier what lane he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in, while the aerial traffic signals which were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen everywhere made it easy to find one's position.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The direction signs located near the "A" and "D" lane</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals, were plainly visible from the highest traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">lane by day, and well illuminated by night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the taxiplane continued to the west, the sea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights in the city below gradually thinned out, and soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were over the suburbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better drop down to the landing level at the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">'D' lane," Riel informed the driver through the taxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The "D" lane signal was not far ahead, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were soon down on the landing level again. Here in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suburbs the traffic in the lower lane was not at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">congested, and the taxi proceeded along at a good pace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had not gone far along the lower lane when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the detective again used the taxiphone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A half mile to the northeast; three white, four</seg><seg type="columnLine">green and red in the square, south entrance," he di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected the chauffeur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plane was slowed down as it approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleuth's landing place which could be seen plainly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they approached. Three white lights formed a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangle, surrounded by a square of four green lights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the exact center of the landing space, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four red lights marked the four corners of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">area. Approaching from the south the plane slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground between the first two red lights and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped just beyond the center lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have a nice location," Wallace remarked, step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the plane and looking the place over. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, what I can make out in the dark looks favorable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What is the long building to the west of the house?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is my garage," the host explained. "I keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">two cars and a plane and have a reserve space for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each. I have barely enough ground to provide my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self with air landing privileges. It's fortunate that</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes can descend slower and stop quicker than they</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to, or I'd need a ten-acre tract for my landing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But even at that everyone cannot afford an individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing. Most of my neighbors use community fields.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A group of neighbors maintain one landing field and</seg><seg type="columnLine">air shed, which serves them all. It's a very economical</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and quite efficient too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conversation was here interrupted by the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach of a policeman from the shadows of the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Any orders, sir?" he asked, addressing the detective.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, Lester, I have a little job that you will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do carefully," Riel instructed the man, with a side</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at the wrist indicator. "I am expecting a visitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon, and I want you1 to be sure to get him for it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">important that he doesn't get away. Is Simpson on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the job?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes sir, he's on the other side of the house."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very good, then both of you keep in the shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">until you spot him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this the detective approached the illuminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance to the house. Pausing at the door he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">around to the police officer:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And it's equally important that the ray doesn't catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in the act, understand Lester?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes sir, the job will be done quickly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since I've been on this case," the Englishman ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained to his companion as they entered the hall, "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">had my house under constant guard with two men on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each shift, for I can't be too careful when dealing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a clever crook as our master criminal undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Entering a large room off the hall, he invited Wallace</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, explaining, "This is my combination room; part</seg><seg type="columnLine">library, part laboratory and the rest designed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            Riel's Story</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE room indeed was a combination room, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American thought, as he looked about. The thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpets and easy chairs with their well-stocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking stands, gave an air of comfort to the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along the wall opposite, from the hall entrance, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">a well-filled book-case, and to the left at the far end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room was a mass of electrical equipment, neatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted on mahogany-colored panels, forming a</seg><seg type="columnLine">switchboard about six feet high and eight feet long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My mechanical assistant," smiled the host, noticing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his guest's interest in the apparatus. "Such equipment</seg><seg type="columnLine">is necessary to fight modem crime. The scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminal employs all possible scientific methods to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complish his work; and to fight them, the law must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be equipped with suitable weapons. My secret radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment is mounted on that board and also my ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">deflector."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you have a device that will deflect the vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This house is surrounded by a strong, magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, which deflects the vision ray and prevents it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrating the walls of the house. Also the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave detector is rendered useless, for the voice pulsa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, when picked up, are carried on the vision beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some manner, so inside the house we are free to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk and move without fear of detection. I have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray detector outside the house at a safe distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magnetic field, similar to the wrist watch indicator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It consists of two large coils of wire with a sensitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnetic needle balanced between them.

This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged so that I will know when he has the ray on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my house.

A study of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these markings seems to have proven beyond a doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some one of intelligence must have produced them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that they were not just freaks of nature. A Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man produced the invention in America and wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to Europe with drawings of it.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was working on your case, at the time, trying to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termine how your liners were brought down. I had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by then, discovered that a vision ray was being used,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had built my protecting field around the house, also</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PLANET'S AIR MASTER	169</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">using the compass attachment on my wrist watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Secretly I called on him, carefully disguised, fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the criminal might be after the plans himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be watching the inventor closely with the ray.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In that I was right, for I detected the ray every few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes while I was there. Taking advantage of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment when the ray was off I slipped his plans into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my brief case and substituted some others in their place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, instructing him to take the air liner to London</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next morning, I left him, and, again changing</seg><seg type="columnLine">makeup, left New York the same evening on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight-thirty cruiser. You know the rest, how the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane that was escorting one of your cruisers was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coaxed away from the ship which was brought down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only the papers of the inventor were taken."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then why did he jump to his death during the trip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he knew that the stolen papers were worthless, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you still had his genuine ones safe?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He didn't jump to his death," Riel replied quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"he was murdered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What!" The eyes of the air line official opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">with amazement. "Why man, there were at least a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen passengers that witnessed the act. He deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately swung his window down and jumped out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Wallace, I've told you before that I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that a power is being used that is many times as</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly as the vision ray and the voice wave detector</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined. It is this power that brings down your</seg><seg type="columnLine">liners, the reason why no police are ever on the job</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a robbery occurs, the same reason why the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">escort planes leave your cruisers just before they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought down. And it was due to this deadly power</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the inventor was made to leap from the ship into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean below. He was murdered by the wizard, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking that he had the only copy of the plans, caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's death to prevent him from drawing a dupli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate set. With the death of the inventor, the criminal</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be in possession of the only set of the plans on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. But there the man made his first mistake for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the papers that he got were worthless, and the inventor</seg><seg type="columnLine">being dead, there was only one thing that he could do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that was to obtain the only set that was in ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istence. Just how he discovered that I was in possession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, I don't know. But knowing that I was track-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him down, it is quite natural that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspect me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The theft of the vision ray apparatus, some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago in Paris, the invention of a young Frenchman, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">undoubtedly the work of this man. Probably the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of that was the start of his mad career, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has improved the ray and used it along with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own inventions, such as the sound wave detector,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to serve him in his lust for power. With it, he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably been able to learn many of the world's secrets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for there is little that is closed to him. The vision ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor, however, was able to make a duplicate model</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his device which is used universally to-day, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, it only has a range of about fifty miles. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see the stolen one must have been greatly improved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The one our criminal uses has a range of two thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand miles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Riel Explains</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'*13 UT why does he value this light wave receiver</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">D so high?

He will no doubt keep track of them, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are placed in the control room of the cruiser or</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to you, and he will most likely try to bring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser down to get the papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now here is where you come in.

The reason that you are riding as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a switchboard tester is so that you will be close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator all the way over, and can prevent any attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">by him to bring the liner down. When you step on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board at the sheds, make up your mind that you will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">allow the ship to leave the upper beam from the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">you start until you arrive over New York.

The suspicions were confirmed when I pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posely brushed against it in the crowd and felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of it. Later he was near us on the car, reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">a paper, and all the way out to where we got off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train, I noticed that he gazed at the same comer of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a long spacious room, equipped with all kinds of scientific apparatus. At the base</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> si the center panel, a man was kneeling. His hay was white and long, and a black skull-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cap covered the top of his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">170</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PLANET'!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">page, which was not likely of a man interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading. So I purposely talked of the drawings here</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was going to show you, expecting that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear us and follow us here. As an agent of the wizard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would, no doubt, try to find the location of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, the one thing the ray hasn't yet been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. Upon our arrival at the office, I found that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray was on us, and I planned the talk of shipping some</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable papers across the ocean, knowing that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would suspect me of trying to secret the coveted plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">across and hide them in America. When we left in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, I was glad to see that the ray was not following</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. The wizard had undoubtedly thought that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was little that we would do but plan the trip for to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow, so he let us go, probably fearing possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">detection of his headquarters by too much use of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray. The agent, though, will probably make an attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn something of the papers and follow us here. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he does my men will get him. I want to get him out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way so I'll be free to act in the next few days."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now 111 call my assistant at the central office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he can have his part of the job ready," the detective</seg><seg type="columnLine">added going, over to a desk in front of the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there no danger of your message being over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard?" Wallace asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not in the least, for first my wireless system breaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">the message into pieces sending it out on three differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent waves. I have a disk that is rotated by a motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted on the rear of the control board. This disk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">during one rotation, makes contact with three different</seg><seg type="columnLine">circuits each radiating waves of a different frequency.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now the message pulsations pass through the disk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">are cut up, and only every third pulsation is thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto any one circuit. Then it is easy to regulate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of the disk so that it will break up the message</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently to be unintelligible when received on any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave. Also, to make the message extra safe, I some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times use coded words which my assistant and I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged. Further, we keep the combination settings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two sets a secret, for, you know, he must set</seg><seg type="columnLine">the receiving instrument at the same wave-lengths as</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine and must also set the speed of his reassembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">disk motor to correspond with the speed of mine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assemble the messages correctly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Final Instructions</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SEATING himself at the desk the sleuth lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone and pressed a button. A moment later, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small white light lit up on one of the panels and Riel</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke into the transmitter:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am returning to New York on a special I.

"But how--oh! here we are, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires come up to the handle and connect to a vibrator</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar under the handle. You see Wallace," he continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to his guest, "how he was able to overhear</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation that was too low for his ears to detect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This device detects the sound waves, changes them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical pulsations, amplifies them up and through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wires to the handle over the vibrator bar.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I intend to give our wizard other things to attract his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to-morrow; and he will likely be too busy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay much attention to the man. But I think that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have some lunch and get some sleep for we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have work to do in the morning, and you especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be fully rested to do your part well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg><seg type="columnLine">Against Their Will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT about ten-thirty the next morning, Wallace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disguised as Riel, entered the air sheds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'I.

Just use your manual controls until</seg><seg type="columnLine">you reach the upper beam."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The motors were soon humming with a smooth mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sical note, and as the huge doors of the sheds rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, the special started forward and was soon speed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down the field. Wallace was climbing into a suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of overalls as the liner took the air. The pilot drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the landing gear, and, having nothing more to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down beside the operator. The steady climb soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought them to the upper beam, and as the cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">righted herself, the battery of motors began to hurl</seg><seg type="columnLine">her forward with increasing speed. The sky was</seg><seg type="columnLine">172	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cloudy over the British coast, and at times nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen but heavy banks of clouds. But the craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept to the beam and was allowed to continue its</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific speed, tearing blindly along through rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks of fog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There may be a chance of getting through this trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the fog sticks with us until we get a good start,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wallace remarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I doubt it sir," replied the operator. "I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced down twice and there's something uncanny about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">would start the ship downward, but at any rate we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will make damn sure that no one brings us down this</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip, for if our automatic! controls fail us we will use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manual levers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they sped along, the atmosphere cleared up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a half hour, then they ran into an even foggier</seg><seg type="columnLine">area, and the heavy rolling fog-banks were sent flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the speeding craft on both sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should think we'd enjoy the trip better if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to drop down a little out of this clouded area,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested Wallace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His pilot was evidently thinking the same thing, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked: "Shall we leave the beam and drop down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The official readily consented, and the pilot using</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manual controls dropped down out of the beam.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had not traveled far before they were below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds with the sea far below in plain view; still the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser dropped, steadily losing altitude as it continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the west. The two men had apparently forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the clouds, for they were allowing the craft to</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily drop without interruption. They were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a thousand feet above the ocean but still they</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued down, to every thousand feet that they trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eled west they dropped a hundred, until the ship bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crest of a wave; flew on, hit the water again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled down onto the ocean like a monstrous sea gull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pilot half absent-mindedly stopped the ship, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Wallace: "You are supposed to be posing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a control tester, Mr. Riel, so here is a good chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out what is the matter with the ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wallace realized that he was on board for that pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose, and turning to the mass of controls on the dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent panels, decided that he might as well look them</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and see what he could find out about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither of the two men noticed a third enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and stand looking at them with a quiet smile on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face.

He could not recollect how the ship had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been brought down, or why he should find himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling among the wiring behind the control panels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But things were now clear to him, and he watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm figure of the intruder, waiting to see what his</seg><seg type="columnLine">next move would be. The pilot was none the less</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled, and he vainly tried to grasp the situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here he was again floating on the surface of the sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after he had made up his mind that he was going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get through on this trip at all costs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well Riel," the bandit addressed Wallace, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will come along with me, the boss wants to ask you a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few questions and it will be useless for you to resist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because you can do nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not Riel, I'm--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We know who you are.

Entering the baggage</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, he detected, through the left door, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, the little white plane which had so successfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">eluded all police planes. In the cabin, he was forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swallow a small tablet which the captor handed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a few minutes was lost in sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Meeting the Wizard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Wallace opened his eyes, he was lying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bed in a small room. Rising to a sitting posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion he pondered over the situation. His brain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow in clearing up, due to the effects of the sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">tablet, but it was not long before he remembered every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. He had been kidnapped as Riel. Apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the criminal leader desired to get the sleuth into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, and hearing the talk in the offices of the I. A. L.</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stopped the liner to get Riel, and had got him</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead. Wallace, seeing that his disguise was not dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed, walked quietly to the door, opening it softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened up into the side and near the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a large room: It was a long spacious room, fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped with all types of scientific apparatus. Along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall opposite to his door ran a bench about two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirds of the room in length or approximately twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five feet long. This was fully equipped with a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete outlay of chemical experimental and testing equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. The rest of the room was filled with the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est display of electrical equipment that he had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid eyes on. Stepping into the room he found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the wall, near which he was standing, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second bench running about the same distance down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room as the other. This was constructed of grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">slate, and covered with all sorts of electrical instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and parts, wires and partly-assembled devices,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of which he had never seen before. Much of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the material was connected by loose wiring--probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">for testing. Above the bench mounted on the wall were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a row of marble panels extending the length of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench, and fastened so that any one panel could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken down with little trouble. The different panels</seg><seg type="columnLine">were electrically connected together by a type of spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch that could be disconnected by a mere touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand. The mass of equipment on these panels was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too complicated and too unfamiliar for him to even</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a guess as to their use. At the far end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, about six feet beyond the end of the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">benches, was a massive instrument-board reaching from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor to about eight feet in height and about two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirds the room in width or approximately twenty feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every panel on the board was literally covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dials, meters, coils and other controls. In the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room was a long table with chairs around it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many instruments, push-buttons, meters and such were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk into the polished top of the table, leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface unobstructed. And in front of each chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the table were squares of frosted glass about</seg><seg type="columnLine">six inches square and supported vertically by an ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justable bracket, so that it could be tilted into different</seg><seg type="columnLine">positions similar to a mirror on a dresser. Frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged that the heavy ornamental table legs must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow and carried all the wiring from the table con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols and instruments, for he could see no other outlet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, if he was not somewhat familiar with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, he would have doubted that there were any</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PLANET'S AIR MASTER	173</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wires around the table, for not an inch of wiring could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Riel was right, he thought, this must be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work room of a clever scientist, who was using this</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical equipment to control the world with. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound from the direction of the switchboard attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention, and looking in that direction he noticed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time, a man kneeling at the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center panel. His hair was white and long, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly wrinkled face was clean shaven. His bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders indicated that the work of continually bend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over instruments and drawings was beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell on him. A small black skull-cap covcred the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his head and a cord running down from it was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected to the panel. He was apparently busy testing</seg><seg type="columnLine">something out for he had not as yet; noticed Wallace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This must be the wizard," thought Frank, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently watched his captor. "As far as I can see from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a side view he doesn't seem to be the devil that I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to meet, but you can't always tell a man by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his looks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His thoughts were interrupted by the other rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">and removing his cap. "You are right," he spoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tu.ning and advancing toward his visitor with a quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">but baffling smile, "you can't tell a man by his looks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My advice is to make sure of him by testing him Out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wallace's mouth opened in amazement as his host</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued: "You seem surprised, Mr. Wallace, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can read your thoughts. I, in turn, am surprised that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a simple demonstration of mental telepathy should so</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonish you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mental telepathy? Such a thing is impossible.

Having developed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision ray, I used it in my further experiments to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce the telepathy ray. And it is well that I did, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">after producing a high frequency wave that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry along the vision ray, I knew that I had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His prisoner was silent, he could see the logic of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's words.

He recollected how it was used on them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reveal the hiding place of the papers during the rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery of the liner which he and Riel were taking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">London, also the reason why he and the pilot had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so willing to bring the ship down on the last trip. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wizard was indeed entitled to the name of Master of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For two persons to exchange thoughts," his host con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, "it is necessary that their brains be of like</seg><seg type="columnLine">character, for the human brain is similar to the wire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less instruments. When one wireless set sends a</seg><seg type="columnLine">message into space, the set that receives the message</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be adjusted to a wave length; that is, the circuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that receives the message must be adjusted so that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be most sensitive to the frequency of the waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">that are carrying the message. The human brain works</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the same principle in respect to telepathy. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons having brains whose characteristics are sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilar, will be more successful at mental telepathy than</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. But mental telepathy will never be a success</seg><seg type="columnLine">because the thought waves that a man tries to receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">from another are so feeble that his own thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">drown them out, and it is almost impossible to free the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain from one's own thoughts sufficiently to make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensitive enough to receive the thought waves of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. So you can easily see that there is but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to do and that is to build up the thought waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they are strong enough to be detected by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other brain. In fact, if you build them up strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough and pass them through another man's head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will take possession and control of his brain by</seg><seg type="columnLine">being more powerful than his own thoughts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean that you can force one man to think the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts of another?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly, I will prove it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he spoke, the wizard turned to the electrically</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped bench and commenced to adjust a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of controls on some of the panels mounted on the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Wallace watched him wondering what was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to happen next.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in a moment he forgot about the present, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought about the events of the trip from London.

To think that man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer master of his own brain, no longer able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say what he wanted, or remain quiet when he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to. He realized the havoc and madness the telepathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">could create in the world. People were no longer free</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think without this man knowing all about it. Hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man beings would live in a nightmare afraid to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fear of others hearing them. Even in the secrecy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their own homes the world would know every</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought flashed through their minds. He remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he had imagined the panic that the wizard's vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray would cause if the public ever knew of its existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and use. But there was a protection against the vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray, as Riel had proved. A person had merely to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce a magnetic field of sufficient strength to ward it</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. One's home could then be screened off from it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one's secrets guarded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wallace closed his eyes and then more clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized the devilish effects of this thing. The vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray would at least allow you to think in secret. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">now even when one was thinking how was one to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the thoughts were one's own or those of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else. How could one tell, when he talked, whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was speaking thoughts of his own or those of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other person. It was madness. It was hellish. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">person was far better off dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What the Wizard Revealed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS these thoughts ran madly through Frank's brain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had forgotten about the scientist who was stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing near him with an amused smile on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you intend to use these devilish instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">against mankind to satisfy your greed for power?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wallace demanded finally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will use it against any one who stands between</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and my goal," was the cool reply.

A strap ran down</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side of the face from this cap and fastened below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chin; ear units, covering the ears, were attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the strap also. A close-fitting mouth unit and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black mask stretched across the eyes, having two pale</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blue, convex glasses to see through, were also attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the side straps of the head gearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wallace adjusted his mask and adjusted the square</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glass on the table until he could see it best, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">at best he could see little through the blue glasses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you want to talk," the scientist's voice sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his ear units, "use your mouth attachment, and turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">dial four in front of you.

It was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">close that the bricks could be counted with little dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficulty. Another change began to take place and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bricks of the wall gradually faded as another scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">took its place. As it cleared, Wallace gave a start; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the office of Graham, the London manager of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">I. A.

Your friend of the detective force shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring them to me for I know that he has them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why do you put so much value in the receiver?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You may be unable to decipher the code, because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">language is unknown to us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There you are mistaken again," his host corrected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"for the language is very similar to French, which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can read and speak very well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are only guessing, for there is no way that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can find out the language."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''I have obtained a recorded strip of pulsations re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived by this device, and by changing the pulsations</seg><seg type="columnLine">into electro-magnetic impulses, I amplified them. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing the amplified pulsations into sound waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the voice producer, I recorded the sound and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it to study at my leisure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you have been able to read the message?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, all but a few words which are somewhat con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused.

So when I get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Light YVave Receiver, I will be able to connect up my</seg><seg type="columnLine">system so that the message will be automatically re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived, changed to electrical impulses, amplified and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorded in French which is the language that is being</seg><seg type="columnLine">used. By means of the device, I will learn many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secrets of the super-intelligent planet that is send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the messages, for it is undoubtedly the work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another planet. Finally, by adding their knowledge to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own, I may not only be ruler of the earth, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">master of the solar system. Only the possession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plans is needed for accomplishing my purpose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I will get them, for what I want, I have the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get.

A moment later the scene was ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justed so that they were looking into a single room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The details of the room stood out quite plainly, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the exception of one corner that produced a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange-colored glow. But whether it was the fault</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vision set or was caused by a bright lamp in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the room, Wallace was unable to tell. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no one in the room at the time, but the desk was</seg><seg type="columnLine">littered with papers, indicating that someone had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">there recently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you notice the glowing spot in the comer?''</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jolsen asked through the phone circuit. Then, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out waiting for a reply, continued, "That is where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triple Wave Wireless Receiver is. That glow is caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the magnetic field deflecting my ray. It is a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier at that distance, for I cannot produce suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficient pressure to break it down. But if that field</seg><seg type="columnLine">was within two hundred miles of me, it would be use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, for I could break through it with ease. Riel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">other protecting field also would be of no use to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at close range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then your attempt to read the combination of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">triple circuit receiver is useless?" Wallace said tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ignoring him, the old man shifted the ray again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were soon looking into the basement of the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the switchboard that controlled the lights and</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the building appearing before their eyes. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, the wizard surveyed the scene and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed the ray, shifting it around the room until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought it to rest in one corner where a workman sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading a paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This man is the maintenance electrician for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building," hejnformed his guest. "Now you are about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see how I give orders to the world and how quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and faithful it does my bidding."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few more buttons and dials moved beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's fingers. The man in the scene looked up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his paper and scratched his head in deep thought and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally deciding something he rose and approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switchboard. Quickly Jolsen brought the board up</seg><seg type="columnLine">close in the scene as the man stopped! in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panels, and looked over the different breakers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips. Again the fingers of Jolsen moved a dial and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next instant the man in the scene tripped the larg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est circuit-breaker on the board. Instantly the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed and that of the office was seen again, the glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the comer was now gone and the cabinet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless set could be seen on a table, and a device that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wallace judged was the recording device was resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the receiver. Another moment and the wizard had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a close view of the set, so close that the dials could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen and the settings read with ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was but a few seconds until the old man had copied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dial readings, and then suddenly the glow in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comer returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Message</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER shutting off the ray, Jolsen removed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask and Wallace did likewise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' "You see I have the combination," remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wizard, with a smile, "and it was very little trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You used your telepathy ray?" asked Wallace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, you see the power that is used to produce the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field around the wireless set is taken from the lighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">circuits, and to remove the field, all that I had to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to turn off the power. That I did by putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts into the brain of the electrician to that effect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Controlled by the thoughts that took possession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind, he went over to the board and tripped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main breaker, throwing the power off the whole build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">176	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. This, of course, removed the power that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplying the magnetic field, and the result was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no more field. Of course, as soon as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed the ray from the man in the basement, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in command of his own senses, and seeing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaker was out, no doubt he thought that it tripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on account of overload. So to prevent him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing it back in, I could have led him away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place, or done a dozen other things with him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep him away had I wished. But I did not want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the power off too long, for it would lead them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigate. Riel, hearing of it, might get suspicious."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you are going to send the message to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">office?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, to his home. The two sets will be adjusted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same setting so I can send my message via his</seg><seg type="columnLine">office set to his home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you could have taken the reading of the set at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his house as well as at his office," Wallace said, puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, the protecting field around his house is not sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied from the power lines like the one in the office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He has, no doubt, a small independent generating plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the house, and as it is inside the field, I cannot find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way to throw the power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then your telepathy ray is of no use outside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision beam?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, when the vision beam is deflected, the telepathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray is also deflected, for it is carried on the beam. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will get the circuit settings changed to correspond</seg><seg type="columnLine">with those of Riel's set. You may stay here at the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">and use it, and if you would like to change the adjust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, use these two dials here. Oh, there is no chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you learning too much," he added, noticing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled look on the other's face. "I will see to that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you did learn some of my most important secrets, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have no cause for worry because it is impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you to escape from here. This place is located on</seg><seg type="columnLine">an uncharted island."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With these words, he disconnected his mask from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table and took it over to the experimental bench. Wal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lace watched the wizard adjust some of the controls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and automatic contactors on the wall panels. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">donning the head set again, Frank pressed the vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray contactor button. The reflector screen lighted up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the touch, and the office scene was again before his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. But now there was someone at the desk. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no doubt but that the man was Riel's assistant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wondered if he was aware that the ray was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. A closer adjustment of the scene soon satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, for the man wore a wrist watch, and Wallace</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed him look at it occasionally. Could he signal the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man? The thought flashed through the official's brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew the international wireless code. Perhaps by</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutting off the ray and switching it on at long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">short intervals, the detective would notice it. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. Nervously his fingers pressed the ray button on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and off as he spelled the word "Rid" twice, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">switching on the ray, he watched the man closely. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fellow did not seem to notice, for he continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing at his desk and seemed absorbed in his work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A moment later, however, the man leaned back in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, and looking up spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Wallace, wish we could help you but don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose hope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His heart beat faster as he heard the words, then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had read the message, and knew that he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner. He felt greatly relieved that Riel would</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that he was alive and in the laboratory of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wizard. He also realized that Riel would perhaps look</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for help from him in case they attempted to attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a tap on his shoulder, and Wallace re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved his head set to see his host standing behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The detective didn't receive your signals by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wrist watch," the old man remarked, with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amused smile on his face. "He has a similar indicator</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his desk that he can watch. But I shall have to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you send no more signals, or keep you from using</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't there anything I can do without you knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?" asked the disgusted prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If there was, you might do me harm. As it is, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are harmless. I allowed you to send your message be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause you can do yourself little good, or me little harm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The world is in my power, and your feeble rebellious</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts will not help you any. In fact they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove advantageous to me, for by reading your thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">just now, I found that your friends were using a wrist</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch as a ray indicator, a thing I did not know before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I am ready to send them the message. Put your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask on again and you will hear it as it is being sent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We will also watch the set at the office to be sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it records corTectly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Threat Made Good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH masks adjusted, a few controls were moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of each of the men and a red dial care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully turned. A scraping sound in the ear pieces gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to words:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Detective Riel will place the drawings of the Skubic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Light Wave Receiver on an air liner, which will leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">London to-morrow morning at 9.30 for New York. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fails to do this, I will create a reign of terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">through England, that in horror, will be beyond imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. By order of: The Planet's Air Master."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The message is now recorded on his oscillograph,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wizard informed his captive. "Now he is going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch the announcer into circuit. Listen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later their head sets were connected with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound wave panel of the vision ray apparatus, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the detective could be heard adjusting the dials, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped to the set to see what message had come in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he did, the announcer spoke out the message to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man stood before it a moment or two as if tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porarily stunned, a deep look of worry came over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, then slowly shutting off the set he returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slight disturbance on one of the meters caused old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jolsen to leave the scene of the office and throw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray around the sky, sweeping back and forth, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time watching the meter. In a few moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had the beam on a fleet of six planes that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wallace also saw them and his heart gave an extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat as he realized that they were probably following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beam, in an endavor to trace it to its source. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes rose further as he recognized the slightly tapered</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings of the Burley plane, used by the American police.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wizard was quietly watching them as he kept them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is my opportunity to demonstrate to you my</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers," he boasted through the phone circuits, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to adjust some more controls, and draw the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer. "I'll show you the powers of my telepathy ray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the same time illustrate what happens to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who meddle into my affairs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He busied himself on a few more dials, while Frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PLANET'S AIR MASTER	177</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered what his game was, thinking that the wizard</seg><seg type="columnLine">would lead them off the trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now the ray is on, watch the greatest demonstra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of power ever seen on earth," the cool boastful</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice sounded in his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frank needed no invitation to watch. He sat tensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching to see the effects of this ray. Suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet of planes broke formation and commenced circling</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another in a strange and disorderly way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks like 111 have to strengthen the ray," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wizard was saying. "They have picked men with very</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong will-power. But I'll break them with less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a kilowatt increase."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More adjustments were made with some of the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls under his hands, as Frank glued his eyes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene. Then he gave a quick start and his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">paled. The planes were now racing around each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">at maximum speed. Then he heard the rat-tat-tat, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmistakable sound of a machine gun that added its</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise to the hum of the motors. There could be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt that they were shooting at something. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth of the situation came to him, and a chill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror ran through his body. Under the power of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telepathy ray they were shooting each other down like</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad-men. Each one undoubtedly saw himself sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by a flock of savage beasts. The ray was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling their brains with a bestial rage, and each ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pouring shells and gas streams into the rest at every</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Terror</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DRIVEN almost insane himself by the slaughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">before his eyes, Frank savagely tore the rigging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his head. He would smash the ray control panels</seg><seg type="columnLine">or die in the attempt. Seeing the other was still wear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his mask and watching the scene closely, Wallace</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced over at the main control switchboard, on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mounted most of the control units of the telepathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray. In one moment he could rip the mess of fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires behind the panels and put the ray out of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission, thus saving the lives of the men who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now butchering each other. Quickly, but quietly, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose from the chair. But the moment he left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cushions, se seemed seized with pain, and he sank back</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to move a limb. Suddenly as the cramp seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, it left him again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was expecting you to do something contrary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wishes." The wizard had removed his head set</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was regarding his companion with an amused ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression on his face. "I adjusted the paralyzer ray on</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. You set it off, when you attempted to leave your</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. But come, you are missing a fine scene." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">donning the head apparatus again the scientist was soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloating over the scene before him on the reflector</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate. Wallace, realizing the uselessness of any further</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to destroy the ray, put on his own head set</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scene that met his eyes was horrible. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now only five ships in the air, and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting each other in the most savage and desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">way possible, recklessly spraying streams of bullets</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and about them and using the deadly gas guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">at every opportunity. Suddenly one broke out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames, but the two members of the crew stuck to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">posts and the blazing craft tore through the group,</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing left and right until it shot down like a flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor, disappearing in a bank of steam as it struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. The scientist adjusted the controls until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were looking into the interior of one of the ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The man at the gun was sending streams of shells at</seg><seg type="columnLine">every chance, while the pilot with cruel set face, sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship careening around the battle area. The loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of the engines and guns at close range were ring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in their ears so loudly that old Jolsen had to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce the sound with the volume regulator. One plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking a wide circle, left the center of battle and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the wizard had the center of the ray on it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The gunman was looking around desperately for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane to shoot at Then, turning to his pilot, he paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment while rage and hate registered on his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, with a savage oath, he sprang on the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companion. Fighting madly like beasts, under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence of the damnable ray, the two men rolled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clawed, and scrambled among the controls, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unguided craft sped to its doom. A few moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, the tortured minds of the two men were calmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by death, as the sea closed over them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tearing the mask from his head again, Wallace</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned back in his chair, weak and pale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God," he stammered as the other turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, "if I ever get a chance to make you pay for this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you 11 pay dear. You must have the soul of the devil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for no human could slaughter his fellow man like that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wizard merely smiled the same cool, maddening</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. "What you have seen is but an infinitesimal</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of what is to come, if this world forces me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">declare war on it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frank rose wearily from his chair. He was sick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally and physically. He had received all that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stand for one day, he wanted to rest and forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nightmare. Entering the little bed-room, he flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself down on the bed in misery. But the mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain was too much for him, and he soon fell into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The World Obeys</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE sun was high in the sky when he awoke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following morning. For a moment, he wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he was. Then the events of the previous day</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to his mind. Remembering the threat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wizard, he was anxious to see if the air cruiser would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the plans, and what the wizard would do if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to get them. He had slept all night in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes and wasted no time in stepping out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good morning. I hope you had a good rest," was</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man Jolsen's greeting from the table where he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going over some plans. Frank made no reply and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man, pressing a button, continued his work. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">door at the end of the room on Wallace's right opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a butler appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take care of any of this gentleman's needs," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wizard ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This way, sir," the butler politely requested him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading the way out through the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frank noticed that the bathroom windows were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred or protected in any visible way, nor those in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, luxuriously furnished dining room. But he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no idea of attempting to escape. He had no doubt but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the place was well protected, for he knew that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man like the wizard would take no unnecessary chances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He also realized that with such a calamity as the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathy ray threatening the world, he would be of no use</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the outside, while he might be able to accomplish</seg><seg type="columnLine">something from within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The breakfast that was served was an excellent meal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was evident that the scientist had no trouble in</seg><seg type="columnLine">178	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">obtaining any of the world's delkacies when he needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he returned to the laboratory, the wizard was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the table using the vision ray, and Frank, not caring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to miss anything, slipped into his chair and donned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head set, and the scene that met his eyes he quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized as the air line station in London.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had not long to wait until a westbound cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">glided in, stopping to receive its load of passengers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wizard swept the three platforms and the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior of the liner with the ray, watching the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely. But he seemed to detect nothing unusual, noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to lead him to think that the detective organization</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sending the plans out on that liner. He then tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telepathy ray on some of the officials and the liner</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew, but no thoughts could be read indicating any</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the papers. Frank, connected to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transforming unit of the telepathy detector, could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought message as well as his host. It appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the police were intending to defy him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the wizard straightened up, a slight hum</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be heard in the ear units. Tearing his head set</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigging off, he leaped across to the automatic wireless</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorder, and switched on the announcer. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scraping noise and, as it died down, a man's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded clear and distinct in the instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Light Wave plans leaving on air cruiser 49 S. P."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was all, the instrument became silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see they are beginning to realize the power I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold," exclaimed the master criminal, his eyes gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">with greedy pleasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Returning to the vision ray apparatus, he swung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray to the south, and soon had it adjusted on a heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooded island. Frank, gazing through his mask, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to determine the location of the island, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that the trees appeared to resemble those seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tropical regions. He therefore, decided that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island must be somewhere in the torrid zone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the scene was adjusted to appear closer, he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected a small snow-white plane, lying in the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the shore, partly sheltered by the wide-spread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing foliage of the trees. He recognized the plane as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one that made the raid on the air cruiser during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip to London with Riel, and also the same plane that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carried him from the air liner. He could see no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of the pilot, however, nor anyone else in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island. But he was sure that the air man had a hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the woods somewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment the scene remained in front of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, then it was shut off, and he saw the scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">removing his head rigging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just gave my man orders to look over the baggage</seg><seg type="columnLine">room of your airship," he informed his prisoner, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter removed his head apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't hear you do any talking," replied Frank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't talk, I just use my thoughts and put them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the beam. He receives his orders direct from brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to brain, as you noticed he was not even in sight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not increase the pressure of the vision ray suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficiently to look through the trees. I merely threw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telepathy ray across die center of the isle where his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin is, so I know that he will receive the message.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even if he is asleep the thoughts will impress them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves on his mind that he will awaken with a clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembrance of the message."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he turned to the table, and they were soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the ray as it was trained onto the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser, which was now well out at sea, speeding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">along the upper air beam towards New York. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vision ray was soon adjusted so that the baggage room</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exposed to the eyes of the two men, and with little</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty, they found the package, a small wooden box</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little over a foot square, plainly marked "Light Wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Receiver." There was no address on the box, in fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other marking except the three words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had evidently been placed in the baggage room</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the ray had been taken from the ship as it lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the station, because the previous search of the bag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gage room revealed no sign of the box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wizard gave a chuckle of satisfaction which pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced an uncanny sound in the ear units.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wallace noticed that there were four men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage room, instead of the usual two. The box was</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed conspicuously as though they wanted to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure it could be found. He suspected that Riel was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bottom of the movement, and that they had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap of some sort to spring on the raider, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his usual call. He wondered if the detective</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the full power of the telepathy ray, and if in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some way he was going to overcome it. His thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were disturbed by the sudden shifting of the ray, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist took a look to see if the plane was on the job.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the little white plane was already swiftly cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the clouds, occasionally fading from sight as</seg><seg type="columnLine">its color blended with the white background, disappear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing altogether as it dived into the white masses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Hope</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE old man was apparently satisfied with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress of the plane, for he left it and swept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky for signs of any police planes. The ray de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected a squad of four planes flying west about fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles behind the liner, and flying much lower. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being outdistanced rapidly by the cruiser, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wizard thought they were too close to be comfortable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he again switched on the telepathy ray, and under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guidance of his devilish brain the planes were turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">north, and led away from the path of the swift air</seg><seg type="columnLine">liner. When they were far enough out of the way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfy him, the telepathy ray was taken off, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision ray switched back to the speeding air cruiser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time the control room was placed on the scene,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Wallace gripped the arms of his chair, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that he was about to see the manner in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the previously raided air cruisers of the I. A. L. had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been brought down. For ten minutes the ray was</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed to follow the cruiser, and no attempt was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use the second ray. The clever wizard was biding</seg><seg type="columnLine">his time. He no doubt would bring the liner down at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain spot towards which the little white plane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have a number of hours to wait now," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wizard said, turning to Wallace. "I will call you</seg><seg type="columnLine">when something interesting happens."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wallace rose and sauntered through the room, rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for awhile in his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, a man appeared to conduct him back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have the liner now," the old man said. "Watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">it." Wallace put on the head set and saw the interior</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air-liner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pilot was leaning against the window of his room</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching an occasional ship pass on the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean far below. Occasionally his view would be ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PLANET'S AIR MASTER	179</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">structed by the clouds floating in the air below. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would see only a sea of snow-white clouds, reflecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bright rays of the sun overhead, giving them a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkling silver finish. An occasional glance at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluster of meters was about all the pilot had to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the swift, time-defying trip across the ocean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frank glanced over at his captor who was connecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telepathy ray onto the vision beam. Then he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more to the scene before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pilot was looking at the meters on the board, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight frown came over his face, and he rose from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat to study the meters closely. He seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble in seeing, for he brushed his hand across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and across the polished glass of the petrol supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord," he exclaimed, "the petrol tanks are</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty, we'll have to drop down and wait until we get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a supply sent to us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching for the altitude meter he turned the adjust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment key, setting the meter needle at zero or sea level.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He then switched the automatic radio control off, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monster ship tilted slightly forward on a long, slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent. It gradually approached the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water below. There was no call to the control room</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the passenger deck, and no excited rush by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew to determine the nature of the trouble. They all</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed that the fuel tanks were empty, for the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathy ray had everyone on the ship under its control.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scarcely had the craft hit the water, when the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">white plane dropped down beside it, and the baggage</seg><seg type="columnLine">room guards, under the influence of the telepathy ray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the door on the south side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frank was watching closely, he was positive that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something behind the sending of the box on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser, a trap of some sort. With excitement shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes, he watched the man step from his plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the baggage room. The four guards stood obedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently aside and the visitor, quickly spying thef box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked it up, tucked it under his arm and bowed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self gracefully out. A moment later the plane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing into the air again, and was soon lost in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frank's hopes sank within him, for he had counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an attempt of some sort to battle the raider. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared that Riel had planned such an attempt, but did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know the full power of the ray. And now, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plans of the Light Wave Receiver in his power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wizard was liable to do anything. He had obtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the world all that he desired, and probably would</seg><seg type="columnLine">start his reign of terror to show the multitudes his</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. He was even likely to keep his threat of plung-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the world into a gigantic struggle of extermination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Closing In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WEARILY, Frank removed his head set, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned around to see old Jolsen at his test bench,</seg><seg type="columnLine">working on a box of electrical equipment. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">examining the wiring in the interior of the cabinet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully making adjustments and repairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The plans will be here by three o'clock," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced good naturedly, looking around at Frank. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a model of the Light Wave Receiver here. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">copied it from the inventor's first model, by the aid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my vision ray. If I had had the other ray at the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have stolen the chemical formula from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. That is all I need to complete the receiver. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">formula shows how to mix the chemical solution that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is used to filter the waves through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frank turned once more to the vision ray. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to control it now, and his strange host raised no</seg><seg type="columnLine">objection, except to keep the controls of the telepathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray secret. Swinging the ray along the sky, he soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded in finding the raider plane, it was approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the island. Gliding down onto the water, the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">was guided up to its place beneath the low hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and the man stepped out and disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not being familiar with the pressure adjustments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frank was unable to penetrate the tree barrier, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to wait until the man came into sight again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wondered why the plane had come down by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island instead of speeding to the scientist with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveted plans. He would have thought that the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was intending to wait until dark, so that there would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be less danger of being detected. He discounted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">notion when he remembered that the scientist had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the papers would arrive during the afternoon. Further,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no need for the plane to fear any police</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the ray was able to keep them off. He suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed something moving in the water, coming into</seg><seg type="columnLine">view from behind the trees on the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island. It was a submarine, cruising with decks awash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the observation tower only was above the water. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was moving swiftly around the island and was soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming towards him, and he quickly guessed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarine was a part of the old wizard's equipment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">used so that his location could be reached with little</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of detection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wallace followed the submarine for about an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then swung the ray idly through the sky, looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">new scenes of interest. His attention was drawn to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet of planes approaching, there were eight of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">â– in the group, flying abreast of one another with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance of one-half mile between them. As he swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray from side to side, he looked over the fleet, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could form no idea of their distance from him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thrilled to see that they were coming directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards him. If it was an attempt to locate the base,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he decided that he would assist them by letting them</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the ray to follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wondering if there were any more craft in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching, he started swinging the ray around in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle.' Six more planes were approaching from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northeast. But to the north the sky showed no signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any aircraft, although in the New York-London air</seg><seg type="columnLine">lane, an occasional plane could be seen making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean hop. Around to the west the ray swung, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">here he detected a group of about twenty ships spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the same formation as the fleet in the east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His heart began beating quickly with the excitement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for there was no doubt of it now, they were all police</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes. Those from the west he recognized as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American Atlantic police. He glanced over at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist, fearful lest the old man would get suspicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of something and take a look at the air. Then he shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vision ray off, thinking there would be a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of the old man forgetting it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For over an hour, Frank sat and watched the master</seg><seg type="columnLine">working on his Light Wave Receiving device. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the minutes passed he pictured in his mind the semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle of planes that were undoubtedly closing in on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wizard's base. How close the planes were he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no idea, but he was determined to do his best to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wizard's mind off the vision set as long as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A red light on one of the panels of the main switch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board lit up and old Jolsen fairly leaped for the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">which led to the small dining room, disappearing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment and quickly reappearing, carrying carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">180	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the box, that a few hours ago had been taken from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser. With trembling fingers he tore off the cover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began removing the papers on top. The box still</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained much material for he had picked the drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the very top and soon a square package was uncov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered. As he drew it out and began to carefully unwrap</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, a look of suspicion came into his eyes. Quickly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the experimental bench and came back with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">square cabinet with two meters on the top. Carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing the cabinet on the table, he turned a knob and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the meters. Both remained still but as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the knob further one moved over the scale to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right. His face turned white with anger, as be</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the needle move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They shall pay for this," be stormed, and springing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the vision ray, quickly adjusted his head set and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging the beam across the sky soon spotted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">British police planes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, my hearty friends," he exclaimed, swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray around. "It was clever of you to hide the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">set in the box of plans, but now that you have located</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, you shall lave another demonstration of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He soon found the American fleet that were steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching m the same order. The other odd planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">now formed almost a complete circle around them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall witness another aerial combat," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a lower voice through the system, addressing Frank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We shall pitch the British fleet against the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes. They are well armed and we will be furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">with real amusement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Escaped!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FRANK was frozen with horror. He made up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that he would not stand by and see the devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeat the massacre. He would wait until the wizard</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ready to throw the ray on and he would hurl him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self on him in one desperate chance to save the fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">or keep the ray off them until they were overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought little of his own danger, his main pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose was to prevent the deadly ray from being used.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quietly he disconnected his head set from the system,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but still kept the mask on and watched the scene dosely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The planes came closer and the wizard reached for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switch. He would wait until the old man threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the switch as there would be time then to pounce</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him and throw off the switch before the planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">would meet. The switch moved under the finger of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloating maniac, and with a twist was thrown in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now watch them make a left turn," he chuckled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frank was posed in his chair ready to tear off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head mask. He relaxed a bit and stared into the scene,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planes were still coming ahead. The scientist opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dosed the switch again. The planes still came on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight towards the ray. With an oath he swung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam around to the American fleet and the tdepathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray was again switched on. Frank, with face set and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart pounding, watched. Would they defy it? Were</seg><seg type="columnLine">both fleets protected from the ray?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Snap, the switch sprung into place, and two faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed glued to the vision reflectors. Frank's heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed a beat, he breathed a silent prayer of thanks--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planes were coming on. With face white, and hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking old Jolsen threw off his mask and grabbing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tester from the bench sprang to the board, testing dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent wires and coils, and after making a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjustments, returned to his chair. The ray was again</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained on the British fleet with no effect. Like a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">group of merciless avengers they approached, defying</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything to stop them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A close-up of one of the planes was quickly pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced by the now nervous sdentist, and again the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">was turned on against them, but not even a wink of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye caught the glance of the old man. He was beaten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his most powerful weapon was usdess, and his aveng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing foes were tightening the circle around him. Carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing full bomb racks, they would soon be swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the laboratory with him at thdr mercy. He pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a button and rising from his chair, hastily gathered up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Light Wave drawings as the butler entered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Quick," screeched the old man. "Get the submarine</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instant departure." The servant, with a startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">look on his face, quickly disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The now thoroughly alarmed criminal took time</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to smash some of his most important secrets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned to Frank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on, hurry up out of this door, you're coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, you know too much to be let loose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frank was about to resist when two seamen entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurry, professor, for they will soon be over us,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">one spoke to the old man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Realizing the folly of resisting such a cold-blooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, with two allies, Frank followed the two men out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the door with the sdentist behind. Leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, they started down a path between some' tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, the two men in front broke into a run and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon on the edge of the island where a small boat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beached. Hie submarine could be seen farther out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. Frank saw his chance, with a sudden twist</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned and before the surprised criminal had time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to offer resistance, he was on him and they went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground with a thump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frank heard the shouts of the two men and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding of their feet up the path. Desperately fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing himself free of the old man's dutches he sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the forest and raced for his life across the island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew that his foe's time was too precious to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in chasing him. Looking around he saw the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors struggling with the man down the path to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. He saw the boat put out and reach the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine which, without a moment's delay, submerged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He scanned the sky and detected the small specks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American fleet approaching from the west and for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getful of his own danger, leaped around waving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and shouting for joy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a deep hum, the planes approached overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and commenced circling the island. A small dark object</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped from one. Frank saw it, and crouched at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of a tree with his head in his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> B-o-o-m; the island shook from the impact. B-o-o-m,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second one burst close to the building with a blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash, tearing one side away. Another one came, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer hit, and fragments of the building in which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spent so many hours of mental torture, were hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all directions, the building became a complete wreck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another blinding flash, a deafening, stunning roar, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frank suddenly became dizzy. He groped for the tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed it and fell to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">How Riel Did It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WALT .ACE'S return to consciousness was accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panicd by a headache. He felt his head, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a bandage around it. Lying still with his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">dosed, he soon recalled the events of the bombing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened, but all was quiet. Then the bombing must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ceased, he thought, wearily opening his eyes for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PLANET'S AIR MASTER	181</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">second. He was forced to close them again because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strong light that met his gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How are you feeling, old timer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shiver of joy ran through him at the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice. It was Riel! Turning over on his side</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the familiar voice, he opened his eyes again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was on a bed in a small room and Riel was sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bedside. He raised himself up a bit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What hit me?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fragment of a shell," Riel replied. "I was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried about you, as we dropped the bombs. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to do it. We dared not land, knowing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and cleverness of the man we were dealing with.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had to take the chance and wreck him before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could turn some other infernal invention against us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well I'm out of it, so that's that," was the smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">reply. Then Wallace added more seriously, "But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got away in the submarine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes.' One of the planes spotted him as he dived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but before we could get him, lie had dropped so deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were unable to trace him. However, the planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">are watching for him and we've a chance to get him</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But tell me Riel, how did you buck that damned</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," replied the detective, "I had an idea when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">first met you in New York that a ray was being used</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I found proof enough during our trip to London.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On reaching England I commenced to put into effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plan that I had been working on, prior to my meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. This was a plan to make a person proof against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ray. The idea was to use a metal cap constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of soft iron which I was sure would absorb the mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netic waves of the beam, and carry them around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and in that way prevent them from passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through and affecting the brain. To make a test of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this cap, I ordered that special. You thought there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only two of you on the liner, but there were three</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I was on board."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I had my assistant prepare a corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage room for me and place a large cylinder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast iron in the corner during the night. While you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were asleep, I went out and had a metal cap made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit my requirements, and stole on board the liner and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled inside the large cylinder that was placed on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. When the vision ray was put on the ship the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next day, only the control room received any attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wizard, and I was not seen. The metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder absorbed the ray as I expected. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he had used a greater pressure on the vision ray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could have penetrated through the cylinder. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was, he didn't, for he paid little attention to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the liner outside of the control room. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telepathy ray was put on, you two were effected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but my brain remained clear, which was proof that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap was able to deflect it. Being free of the ray and</seg><seg type="columnLine">having* the spy under lock, I went ahead with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans and preparations with little trouble after return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to London. I equipped a number of our police</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such hats skillfully covered to resemble the</seg><seg type="columnLine">standard police helmet, and had the Central Office in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form the United States Secret Service Bureau of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans with a suggestion to co-operate, and a request to</seg><seg type="columnLine">equip twenty planes and crew to our specifications.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The United States readily took part in our plans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and under my directions, equipped a fleet of planes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They also offered use of the light naval cruiser "Lib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erty," which is the world's swiftest boat of that class.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on which you are riding now on your way back to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. We then had both governments draw all air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sea craft from the zone where we had an idea the</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminal's base was. We were about ready to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">the box of plans which contained a radio set that gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the signals, when the air tragedy took place, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of our planes witnessed. That incident caused us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to equip a much larger force with protective hats, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extra force to scout the sky and prevent any ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught by the ray, from doing any harm. Then men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our police ships, with clear heads, would be at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage over any plane under the power of the ray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would be able to use paralyzer gas bombs on them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting them out of commission long enough to allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to finish the raid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The box we sent on the liner contained a radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">device that was controlled by a sort of altimeter. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio set contained a device with a set of codes on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder which was run by clock-work. Ten different</seg><seg type="columnLine">messages on this cylinder were each thrown into circuit</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a certain reading of the altimeter. That is, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radio box was on a plane at ten thousand feet, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meter reading at that point would cause the contactor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to slide along the cylinder and send out a certain line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of code. At sea level, the meter would read zero, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contactor would shift on the cylinder, giving out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal that we knew indicated that the box was at sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">level. From the moment we placed the box of plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the cruiser, our planes that were spread out all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Atlantic between America and England, were listen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to it and checking it on their direction and location</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicating instruments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Matter of a Tin Hat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"AS the box was carried out by the cruiser, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> /X later taken from the plane and speeded away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sent out the necessary directions to the different</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes telling them what distance to keep from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signals. Gradually we closed in the circle. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to give the signal to raid, when the sea level</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal announced that the plane had come down, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited awhile and was surprised to notice it on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">move again, and later the submerged signal told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were carrying the box below sea level on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarine. I waited until the submarine came up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard the surface signal, then I took a chance on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarine being near the base and gave the signal that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were all waiting for. In a few moments a semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle of planes were closing in on that signal box, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines at full speed, each one anxious to get there</seg><seg type="columnLine">first. The cruiser was only fifty miles from the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she got the signal and was there, almost as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the planes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why didn't you tell me that you knew of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was because I thought the ray would be used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read your mind on the trip back to New York and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I had told you you would have had the thoughts in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your mind all the way back. Again if I had told you</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my plans to use the metal caps to outwit him with,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may have revealed our secret when he read your</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts and he would have created a living hell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this earth before we would have had a chance to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">our plans into effect. Then again if I had let you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear a metal hat, so that he could not read your</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts, then he would have probably detected it</seg><seg type="columnLine">before long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how did you prevent him from using the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read your mind and learn of your plans. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">182	AIR WONDER STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have known that you were assigned to the job of track-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," the detective answered. "But I held one win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning card, the Light Wave Receiver plans. To get</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, he knew that he had to play a careful game."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But he could have made you reveal the place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plans were by using the ray on you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He had tried it on me but was careful to use a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble power.

In other words he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to get the plans from me without betraying his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray. However, he did use the ray on me with sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">force to make me do his bidding, and that was when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and I gave up the papers on the liner coming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">London. He was so positive that the plans were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag that he staked all on obtaining them. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">move he lost, while I obtained proof that he was using</seg><seg type="columnLine">a telepathy ray. When he got the papers and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">them valueless, it was too late, for we were in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">house in London. He doubtless realized then that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become suspicious of his ray, and fearing that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew too much to be at large, he held up the cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you were on, thinking that you were I. In an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt, not only to remove me to where I'd be harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less against him, he also made one more attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn from me the location of the papers before letting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world know of his ray. You know the rest. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how he tried his last trick to get the plans, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to terrorize the police organization with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">message, and how he thought he had succeeded, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we decided to send the plans and sent a message to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect. He knew by then that I was aware of his ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">and realized the power of it. He thought that I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">give up the plans to prevent him carrying out his word."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But your vision screen.

But Bob Allison had been injured, I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered. These men, I presumed, had not. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">much out of his favor, yet I could not suppress a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that he would live.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For what seemed hours, we sat in the anteroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the government hospital nestling almost under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising dome of Point Loma.

Occasionally the door opened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurses entered the room and departed, saying nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us. Presently the knob on the door leading out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field opened and I was surprised to see the portly</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame of my dear friend Senator Allison, enter it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a stride I was at his side, gripping his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joan sat unmoved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim Holdon 1" my friend said, surprised.

"She's taking things</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty hard.

"You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may see him now." She beckoned us to follow her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not knowing what to expect, we walked tensely</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door and into the ward. The cots were</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with sitting and reclining men, some smoking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chatting with their friends. How quickly they had cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the death-like embrace of unconsciousness, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought as we walked between the rows of cots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally the nurse halted in front of a door beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ward and stood by while we entered. I held Joan</seg><seg type="columnLine">back just inside the room, while Senator Allison walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiselessly to his son's bedside. Bob lay motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pale and I was suddenly filled with fear. Joan</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbed softly. Senator Allison bent over and kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his son's white forehead, sudden tears streaming down</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cheeks. A lump rose in my throat and I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	felt tempted to take Joan by the arm and hustle</seg><seg type="columnLine">her from the doorway. It would be very hard to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the death mask that I felt had closed Bob's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever, and in reverence I wanted to depart and leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father alone with him. I lifted my hanging head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked out into the hallway for an instant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Joan tugged at my arm. I turned. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a movement under the bed coverings as Bob lifted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand out of their confines. His eyes opened and closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly as his hand met his father's shaking palm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dad!" he said, weakly. "You've come!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, son," his father whispered. "I flew here as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast as I could. How do you fee!, Bob?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I'll get along alright, dad," he managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. "My chest pains a little, but that's to be ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected. Have you seen Joan Holdon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have, son," Senator Allison replied with a happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin. "She's here waiting to see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joan flew from my arms to the bedside and kneeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down beside it, sobbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joan!"

The "bombing" of New York was</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried out by Lieutenant Moon, despite^ many</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulties. His refueling plane, by which be</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be refueled in the air, forced down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad weather, as well as his radio plane, be</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still enabled to accomplish his mission.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The result anvway was to prove the value of</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigation and radio in plane maneuvers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessons found bv the warfare are three. First,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is feasible to concentrate aircraft from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all parts of the country at a central point, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite adverse weather conditions. Second, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is possible for craft to carry on operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">in weather far from favorable. Third, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment of the air force is quite satisfactory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the maneuvers practically all the available</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting force of the country's aircraft was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrated at Fairfield Air Depot and Norton</seg><seg type="columnLine">Field (Columbus, Ohio).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">is also valuable for gaining experience in land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The glider always takes off to make an</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency landing.

The knowledge that we have of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our bodies is still of the most rudimentary</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature. We are just beginning to become ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted with the all-important glands, we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">still dimly conscious of the actual process of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our evolution.

And now comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">a case in England in whifh through abnormal</seg><seg type="columnLine">gland secretions a woman began to show mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culine characteristics. It is therefore not at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-fetcbed that a great scientist studying birds</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall experiment with their gland secretions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover which glands regulate the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings. Then, he can obtain the secretions_ and</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment with map. Mbs Stone, we believe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very scientific in her picture.

I thought your magazine was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I found some stories that were fair, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">good and a third mighty good--namely "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ark of the Covenant.'' But my digestive</seg><seg type="columnLine">faculties rebelled at the assimilation of "Islands</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Air'\and "Men With Wings." I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore voice my rebellion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the most fundamental laws of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe is that of gravity; the attraction be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween two bodies being pro]&gt;ortionate to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">product of the masses and inversely as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squares of the distances. There are no ifs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ands or buts.

Regarding the analysis of "Islands in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Air" we call attention to the latest theory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Einstein. Gravity, Einstein says, is magnetism,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and therefore, as such, is susceptible to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same laws. In a recent demonstration cobalt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel was shown to have the faculty of acting</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a gravitational shield. The exact limit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power of cobalt-steel has not been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined.

For this purpose we have gathered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> about us a staff of aeronautical experts to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> assist us in conducting the department.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The answers to Mr. Jenkins' questions are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   1.	Tbe propelling force of a plane is, of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> course, an engine which rotates a propeller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The propeller, in cutting tbe air at a great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> speed, like a screw, works columns of air back-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ward and draws the plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   2.	The sustaining force for the plane is the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> air pressure under the wings. In other words,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the velocity of the plane through the air creates</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a pressure of air which, acting against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> wings, sustains the plane. Since the air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pressure is dependent on the velocity of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> plane, and since there is a minimum air pressure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> necessary to sustain the plane, there is a mini-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mum velocity at which the plane will remain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   3.	At tbe tail of the plane is a vertical, mov-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> able vane, called the rudder. If the foot-bar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in the cockpit is depressed with the right foot,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tbe vane ta swung toward the right. That</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> creates an added pressure against the right lide</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of the vane which swings the tail around to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the left, and therefore turns the plane around</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to the right. The opposite would be true in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> depressing the left foot-bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   At the tail of the plane Is a borizontsl mov-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> able vane. When the pilot moves his control</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stick forward the vane is lowered. Therefore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> there is an upward pressure on the vane which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tends to lift the tail. This turns the nose of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> plane down and thereby sends it toward tbe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> earth. Tbe oppose would be true by pulling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the control slide back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   For "banking" the plane, that is, turning the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> thing on its side [which ia necessary when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> changing direction at a high velocity], there are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the ailerons, one located in the rear of each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> wing. By moving the control stick to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> right, the right aileron is lifted, and the left</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> one lowered. This creates a downward pressure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> on the right aileron and an upward on tbe left</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> one. Thus tbe plane banks to the right. To</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> bank to tbe left the control stick is moved to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tbe left---Editor.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Best Aviation Magazine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Editor AIR WONDER STORIES:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I have read through Ait WoÂ»ont Siotita</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from cover to cover and pronounce it the best</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aviation magazine I've seen yet.

In the German tests</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three gliders were attached in a string</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the motored plane which supplied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. What has been visioned is that such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a train, each plane loaded with freight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">having no pilot except in the motored plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might set out across country and each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gliders be "unhitched" at its destination to</seg><seg type="columnLine">glide automatically to a landing field.

A vane is supported on the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing, in the automatic device, and points into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind. A pendulum extending from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior of the fuselage and the vane, is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected to two motors, one controlling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ailerons and the other the elevators. A longi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudinal or lateral motion of the plane causes</seg><seg type="columnLine">a similar motion of the vane and pendulum</seg><seg type="columnLine">which actuates the motors and restores the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stability.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Human Element Causes Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">Accidents</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SURVEY by the Department of Commerce</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the causes of accidents to aircraft dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the latter half of 1928 revealed that very</seg><seg type="columnLine">few accidents are caused by structural failure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plane, la fact, during that period no</seg><seg type="columnLine">such structural failure occurred.
