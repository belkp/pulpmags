                        <ab>The Magic Power of Beauty</ab>
                        <ab>Beauty is the most precious possession a woman may attain. All the arts, crafts, and science in the world's history have
                            centered around the subject. Deep thinkers and men of genius have dignified feminine beauty with their comments. Poets
                            have sung its praises, musicians have set it to melody, literarture has painted it in word pictures, sculptors have carved
                            it in marble, and painters immortalized it in color Lives have been sacrified, wars waged and kingdoms lost and won- all
                            for a woman's beauty.</ab>
                        <ab>What wonder then that every woman longs to be beautiful!</ab>

                            imperfections and creating a soft, dainty, rose-tint complexion.</ab>

                        each other-- I shall tell him And all the porters In the Grand Central Station. And they will have a new interest In me, those

                    <ab>No longer will the policeman stay me, But the thousand others, From crossing the Avenue; Nor will the porters see only Three
                        bags and a box And hopes of a quarter When I tell them that last night, By the black water, By the dark blue water, Under a
                        tree that bent over us As trees bend over lovers In the meadows of heaven, Your hands learned my face And your mouth my mouth,
                        And afire with a new knowledge Our eyes shone through the darkness Like four stars.</ab>
                    <ab>Ah, they will notice me, those men, And touch their caps, And say, "Good morning." And I will answer them As a man should Who
                        has been touched with ecstasy.</ab>
                    <ab>But I shall not tell the little blonde waitress Who served me my breakfast, For I think she, Wise maiden, Has already
                        suspected.</ab>

                    <ab>HIS great grandfather on one side had translated the Bible into the Polyne- sian. His grandfather had been a Baptist minister.
                        His father had worked earnestly for Prohibition. His grandfather, on the other side, had converted thousands of happy heathens
                        to Methodism. His aunt had found happiness in many moral crusades. With an ancestry such as this it was inevitable that
                        heredity should show itself. He kept the police of two continents busy.</ab>

                    <ab>As you remember the story, Jack began to climb at once the beanstalk that had grown so suddenly from this world to another.
                        But the story does not tell how Jack, becoming a little tired half-way tip the stalk, lay down to rest on a leaf rather
                        broader than the others. The stage where this scene is played is on that leaf, and one may see from the audience still others
                        leading upward and down- ward in a gigantic green circular stairway, the thick heavy stalk rising rigid through the
                        center.</ab>
                    <ab>As the curtain lifts, Jack comes about the turn of the stalk. He wears a grey and scarlet gherkin, an impudent cap, and
                        carries a staff of heavy oak. He pauses a moment and appraises this resting-place, then peers down around the stalk whence he
                        has come.</ab>

                    <ab>THE wind is coming home Old and walking slow Quietly over the houses And quietly through the street, Passing the silent trees
                        And over the broad fields.</ab>
                    <ab>The wind is coming home The old familiar way. Tenderly touching the earth And kissing the sleep-drug'd bay, And wondering how
                        he ever went So heartlessly away.</ab>
                    <ab>The wind is coming home. Still he has far to go. He has been out to the ends of the earth And now he wonders why. The wind is
                        getting old And he has the heart to die.</ab>

                    <ab>THERE was a woman in the hospital today-- One of the kind with satin slippers and Ideal perfume; And she thought we were
                        "wonderful" and "truly angels of mercy." She would "just love to be a nurse." And now I am wondering-- I am wondering just how
                        much she would love Those three years of training; The long weeks of night duty With the terrible feeling about three o'clock
                        in the morning That you must sleep or die. The worry on tonsil night for fear some youngster may hemorrhage. The Hamburg steak
                        and poor coffee at midnight supper; The getting up during the day for lectures. And the out-patient service where you go down
                        into the slums To help some Italian or Polish woman have her baby. And the operating room where you stand for hours on a tiled
                        floor And serve an exacting surgeon-- And then polish the instruments and wash bloodsoaked linen. And, after graduating, the
                        living in a suitcase, With the constant companionship of a sick person--day and night. And men taking the attitude of "but I
                        can tell you"-- "You understand things of that sort." I am wondering just how much she would love it.</ab>

                    <ab>I REALLY must be suffering from hallucinations. When I started dancing with Florence I noticed that she had on white kid
                        slippers. Of this fact I am positive. Yet when the music stopped and I happened to glance to the floor I could hardly believe
                        my eyes. The slippers were a sort of peculiar mottled black!</ab>

                        stars just over the horizon, And they seemed to grow On trees that he could reach. So he scampered on, from branch to branch,
                        Wondering why the fairy nut-trees Ran away from him. But, looking down, he spied. A softly wild-cheeked mountain pool, And
                        there a handful of fairy nuts Bit into the indigo cupping them. With a squeal of weary happiness The squirrel plunged into the
                        mountain pool, And as he drowned within its soundless heart The fairy nuts were jigging over him Like the unheard stirring of
                        a poem.</ab>

                    <ab>THE moving picture industry is facing a famine -- a famine in story plots -- photoplays. Higher prices than ever before -- $500
                        to $1000 are being paid for 5-reel dramatic scripts; $100 to $500 for clever short comedies. For the studios--around Los
                        Angeles alone -- need approximately 3000 new stories each year. Producers must have material -- new plots, especially written
                        for the screen.</ab>
                    <ab>And now a plan -- the first to be endorsed by the leading stars and producers -- has been designed to teach you how to prepare
                        your ideas for the screen. The plan was created by Frederick Palmer, for- merly of Universal -- the man who wrote 52 scenarios
                        in 9 months -- more than one a week--all accepted. Mr. Palmer furnishes you with a handbook and cross references to scenarios
                        that have been PRO- DUCED. Both drama and comedy are represented. Since we started a little over a year ago, many of our
                        students have sold their plays, some for as high as $1000. A number of others have already taken posi- tions at the
                        studios.</ab>
                    <ab>Endorsed by Stars, Producers, Directors and Writers</ab>
                    <ab>Under this plan we give you one year's free Advisory Service. And our Sales Service is at your disposal to assist you in
                        selling your plays.</ab>
                    <ab>Note the pictures of the screen stars in this advertisement. All of them endorse the Palmer Plan of Photoplay Writing. These
                        endorsements and dozens of others you will find in our new booklet, "The Secret of Successful Photo- play Writing."</ab>
                    <ab>Write for this booklet now. It will show you the great opportunity in photoplay writing. The book is filled with autograph

                        best to develop photoplay writers.</ab>

                        will show you how to get it produced. If you believe you have an idea for a scenario, this booklet will tell you how you can
