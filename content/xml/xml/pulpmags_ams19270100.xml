To the individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">with imagination it is easy to believe that we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">really not living through the wonders we see, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather, that we are living in a story book, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the achievements about us are nothing but imaginations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Who, for instance, but an imaginative scientifiction writer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would think of making actual use of starlight? Absurd!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet two Swiss scientists, Dr. Kolster, and Dr. Deesalis, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been living in a tent for the last few months, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">summit of Monch Mountain, at an altitude of 13,465 feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have found that a certain group of stars sends out extra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary rays of light, whose radio-active force is far</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger than that of X-rays._ The scientists hope to capture</seg><seg type="columnLine">and employ these rays for scientific and medical purposes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, John Vandercock, writing in the New York Herald-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tribunc, reports on his recent scientific investigations in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dutch Guiana, that he found a certain tribe of Indians that</seg><seg type="columnLine">use the so-called "snake cut," well-known and accepted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the common truth by all Dutch scientists. Just listen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fantastic and incredible piece of near-fiction, which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact nevertheless. The witch-doctors _take_ the head and tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a rattlesnake, the most deadly one imaginable. They then</seg><seg type="columnLine">cook this, together with some herbs, and, under a full moon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it into a dark powder. Now comes the astonishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiling. They take a man and make an incision in his veins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into this incision pour the powder. From that time on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man so treated has the power of paralyzing a snake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he encounters a snake, no matter how deadly it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, it becomes completely powerless at his approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scientists, in analyzing the medicine, have come within</seg><seg type="columnLine">80 per cent of finding the ingredients, but the rest is mystery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They believe that the powder causes a certain exhalation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the perspiration of the person so treated, which has the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of paralyzing the snake. But this is simply a theory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then science comes along and finds the_ densest^ star we</seg><seg type="columnLine">know of--a small satellite of the star Sirius. It is a star</seg><seg type="columnLine">of about the same size as our earth, but weighs almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as our sun. That, of course, means nothing to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination, but translated, it means that if we should col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lect from this star, a little of its material the size of a base-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball, the little ball would actually weigh over 14 tons, or ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximately one ton per cubic inch. That's nothing however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scientists now have a substance called "Neutronium,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we know exists in nature. This material weighs 60</seg><seg type="columnLine">million tons per cubic inch. It would take some 600 Wool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth Buildings, if placed in a scale, to balance one cubic</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch of ncutronium._ Neutronium, is four trillion times as</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense as water. It is composed of an electron and a proton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the two coalesce with each other. It is the most in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">credible thing in the whole world. It is not affected chemi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally. It can not be seen or felt, and there are no means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of getting at it. This is, of course, on account of its ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely small size, so minute that' if it falls, it will pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">through every material on its way. It readily goes through</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass walls, metal buildings, the earth itself, and continues</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling right through the earth, passing through the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it and going towards the other side, only to fall back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It keeps up this pendulum-like motion, its speed decreasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">each time, until, finally, due to friction, it locates at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the earth, where it comes to a stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there is the old mystery of Kaspar Hauser, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">died in Germany in 1833 under circumstances as mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his real identity. His case attracted such remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest that in Germany alone more than 8,000 books have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been written on the subject</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The story, in brief, is that one evening, in 1828, a Nurem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berg shoemaker noticed in the street a youth of about sixteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, whose dazed _ appearance and peculiarity of gait re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled that of an infant just learning to walk. The shoe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maker took him to the local barracks. Offered food, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy refused meat and beer, with disgust, but eagerly ate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drank large quantities of bread and water. Kaspar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hauser was able to write his name, but he babbled like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby. He could see very well in the dark, while bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">light caused_ him acute discomfort, giving rise to inflam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation of his eyelids. He was a metalophobe, and was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensely affected by metals that he had to have wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoons and forks with which to eat. The boy's sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell was as acute as his sight. He fainted at the scent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rose, while the smell of meat made him violently sick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An attempt to give him anything to eat beyond bread and</seg><seg type="columnLine">water made him ill. Even a few drops of wine or coffee</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed in a glass of water caused violent nausea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while he became educated enough to relate his story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it seems that he always lived in a black, low-ceilinged room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he was unable to stand upright. A black or dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">man brought him bread and water every day, and he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little wooden horse to play with. The dark man taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to write, until he finally took him into a street, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy was abandoned. He lost his sensitivity to light and</seg><seg type="columnLine">metals after a while, but the mystery surrounding him</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not end, for two attacks were made on his life. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first attempt miscarried, but when he was stabbed in a public</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden of the town, for the second time, he died three days</seg><seg type="columnLine">later. •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have given these examples of incredible facts simply to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show that we should not be too ready to denounce the ideas</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seem most impossible, for they have a trick of material-</seg><seg type="columnLine">izing even while we are talking about them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">munrimiaiiiiiiiiiiiKuiiiiinniiiunnnuinOkiii</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Hugo Gemsback speaks every Monday at 9 P.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">second and third warrior came from the inside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ant-hill, and ran with tiny clickings about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillock, waving their antennse restlessly, searching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever searching for a menace to their city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They returned to the gateway from which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made their appearance, evidently bearing re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuring messages, because shortly after they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reentered the gateway of the ant-city, a flood of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, ill-smelling workers poured out of the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and dispersed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their business.

The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world, in a far distant future, is peopled with huge insects</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and titanic fungus growths. Life has been greatly altered,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and tiny Man is now in the process of becoming acclimated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the change. IVe again meet our hero Burl, but this time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a far greater danger menaces the human race. The huge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">insects are still in evidence, but the terror they inspire is as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nothing compared to the deadly Red Dust. You will follow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this remarkable story with breathless interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">no less bound by the unwritten but imperative laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the city than they. From the time of waking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time of rest, she was ordained to be the queen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother in the strictest and most literal sense of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, for at intervals to be measured only in terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of minutes she brought forth a single egg, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">three inches in length, which was instantly seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one of her eager attendants and carried in haste</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the municipal nursery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There it was placed in a tiny cell a foot or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">in length until a sac-shaped grub appeared, all soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white body save for a tiny mouth. Then the nurses</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it in charge and fed it with curious, tender</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestures until it had waxed large and fat and slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleep of metamorphosis. When it emerged from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its rudimentary cocoon it took the places of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurses until its soft skin had hardened into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horny armor of the workers and soldiers, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it joined the throng of workers that poured out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city at dawn to forage for food, to bring back</seg><seg type="columnLine">its finds and to share with the warriors and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurses, the drone males and the young queens, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the other members of its communities, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties in the city itself. That was the life of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">social insect, absolute devotion to the cause of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, utter abnegation of self-interest for the sake</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its fellows--and death at their hands when their</seg><seg type="columnLine">usefulness was past. They neither knew nor ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected more or less.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is a strange instinct that prompts these crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures to devote their lives to their city, taking no</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallest thought for their individual good, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the call of maternity or sex to guide them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the queen knows motherhood.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging from the rooflike projection of the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a strange, drab-white object.

In his hand was a horny, chitinous</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear, taken from the body of an unknown flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature killed by the flames of the burning purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since Burl's return from his solitary--and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntary--journey, he had been greatly revered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tribe.

They hung upon his words as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled to tell them of his adventures, and slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dimly they began to look to him for leadership.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was wonderful. For days they had listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathlessly to the tale of his adventures, but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he demanded that they follow him in another and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more perilous affair, they were appalled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED DUST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">881</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A peculiar strength of will had come to Burl. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen and done things that no man in the memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his tribe had seen or done. He had stood by</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the purple hills burned and formed a funeral</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyre for the horde of army ants, and for uncounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of flying creatures. He had caught a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping tarantula upon the point of his spear, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had escaped from the web of a banded web-spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">by oiling his body so that the sticky threads of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snare refused to hold him fast. He had attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and killed a great gray labyrinth spider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But most potent of all, he had returned and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been welcomed by Saya--Saya of the swift feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slender limbs, whose smile roused strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions in Bull's breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the adoring gaze of Saya that had roused</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl to this last pitch of rashness. Months before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clotho spider in the hemispherical silk castle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gruesome decorations had killed and eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the men of the tribe. Burl and the spider's</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim had been together when the spider appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the first faint gray light of morning barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">silhouetted the shaggy, horrible creature as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped from ambush behind a toadstool toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear-stricken pair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Its attenuated legs were outstretched, its-man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dibles gaped wide, and its jaws clashed horribly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it formed a black blotch in mid air against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightening sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had fled, screaming, when the other man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seized. Now, however, he was leading half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen trembling men toward the inverted dome in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the spider dozed. Two or three of them bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears like Burl himself, but they bore them awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly and timorously. Burl himself was possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by. a strange, fictitious courage. It was the utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">recklessness of youth, coupled with the eternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">masculine desire to display prowess before a desired</seg><seg type="columnLine">female.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wavering advance came to a halt. MosfTof</seg><seg type="columnLine">the naked men stopped from fear, but Burl stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to invoke his newly discovered inner self, that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished him with such marvelous plans. Quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">accidentally he had found that if he persistently</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked himself a question, some sort of answer came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he gazed up from a safe distance and asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself how he and the others were to slay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clotho spider. The nest was some forty feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, on the undersurface of a shelf of rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was sheer open space beneath it, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly held to its support by long, silken cables that</seg><seg type="columnLine">curled to the upper side of the rock-shelf, clinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl gazed, and presently an idea came to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He beckoned to the others to follow him, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so, their knees knocking together from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fright. At the slightest alarm they would flee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming in fear, but Burl did not plan that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be any alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led them to the rear of the singular rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation, up the gently sloping side, and toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the precipitous edge. He drew near the point where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rock fell away. A long, tentacle-like silk cable</seg><seg type="columnLine">curled up over the edge of a little promontory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone that jutted out into nothingness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl began to feel oddly cold, and something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the panic of the other men communicated itself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. This was one of the anchoring cables that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the spider's castle secure. He looked and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, six or seven in all, which performed the task</seg><seg type="columnLine">of keeping the shaggy, horrid ogre's home from</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling to the ground below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His idea did not desert him, however, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew back, to whisper orders to his followers. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed him solely because they were afraid, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in an authoritative tone, but they did obey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought a dozen heavy boulders of perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty pounds weight each.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl grasped one of the silken cables at its end</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tore it loose from the rock for a space of per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps two yards. His flesh crawled as he did so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but something within him drove him on. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while beads of perspiration stood out on his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head-induced by nothing less than cold, physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear--he tied the boulder to the cable. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">one done, he felt emboldened, and made a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, and a third.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of his men stood near the edge of the rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening in agonized apprehension. Burl had soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied a heavy stone to each of the cables he saw, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a matter of fact, there was but one of them he</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to notice. That one had been covered by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaking mold that took the place of grass upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky eminence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were left upon the promontory, several of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boulders for which there was no use, but Bur.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not attempt to double the weights on the cables.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took his followers aside and explained his plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">in whispers. Quaking, they agreed, and, trembling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they prepared to carry it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of them stationed himself beside each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders, Burl at the largest. He gave a signal, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen ripping, tearing sounds broke the sullen</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence of the day. The boulders clashed and clat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered down the rocky side of the precipice, tearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">--perhaps "peeling"--the cables from their ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesion to the stone. They shot into open space and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked violently at the half-globular nest, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenched from its place by the combined impetus</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the six heavy weights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had flung himself upon his face to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he was sure would be the death of the spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it fell forty feet and more, imprisoned in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily weighted home. His eyes sparkled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph as he saw the ghastly, trophy-laden house</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing out from the cliff. Then he gasped in terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the cables had not been discovered. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">single cable held the spider's castle from a fall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the nest had been torn from its anchorage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now dangled heavily on its side in mid air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A convulsive struggle seemed to be going on within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then one of the archlike doors opened, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider emerged, evidently in terror, and confused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the light of day, but still venomous and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly. It found but a single of its anchoring cables</seg><seg type="columnLine">intact, that leading to the cliff top hard by Burl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.	,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The spider sprang for this single cable, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs grasped the slender thread eagerly while it</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to climb rapidly up toward the cliff top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As with all the creatures of Burl's time, its first</seg><seg type="columnLine">882</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thought was of battle, not flight, and it came up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin cord with its poison fangs unsheathed and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandibles clashing in rage. The shaggy hair upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">its body seemed to bristle with insane ferocity, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horrible, thin legs moved with desperate haste</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it hastened to meet and wreak vengeance upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause of its sudden alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl's followers fled, uttering shrieks of fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Burl started to his feet, in the grip of a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic. Then his hand struck one of the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders. Exerting every ounce of his strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pushed it over the cliff just where the cable ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared above the edge. For the fraction of a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was silence, and then the indescribable sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an impact against a soft body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a gasping cry, and a moment later the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously muffled clatter of the boulder striking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth below. Somehow, the sound suggested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boulder had struck first upon some soft object.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A faint cry came from the bottom of the hill. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">last of Burl's men was leaping to a hiding-place</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the mushrooms of the forest, and had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheen of shining armor just before him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried out and waited for death, but only a delicately</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed wasp rose heavily into the air, bearing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath it the more and more feebly struggling body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a giant cricket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had stood paralyzed, deprived of the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of movement, after casting the boulder over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff. That one action had taken the last ounce</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his initiative, and if the spider had hauled itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the rocky edge and darted toward him, slaver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its thick spittle and uttering sounds of mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury, Burl would not even have screamed as it seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He was like a dead thing. But the oddly</seg><seg type="columnLine">muffled sound of the boulder striking the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">below brought back hope of life and power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered over the cliff. The nest still dangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end of the single cable, still freighted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its gruesome trophies, but on the ground below a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed and horribly writhing form was moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">in convulsions of rage and agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long, hairy legs worked desperately from a body</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was no more than a mass of pulped flesh. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocious jaw tried to clamp upon something--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no other jaw to meet it. An evil-smelling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticky liquid exuded from the mangled writhing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing upon the earth, moving in terrible contortions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of torment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently an ant drew near and extended inquisi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive antennae at the helpless monster wounded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. A shrill stridulation sounded out, and three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four other foot-long ants hastened up to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently just outside the spider's reach until its</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggles should have lessened enough to make pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible the salvage of flesh from the perhaps still-</seg><seg type="columnLine">living creature for the ant city a mile away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Burl, up on the cliff-top, danced and gesti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated in triumph. He had killed the clotho spider,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had slain one of the tribesmen four months</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Glory was his. All the tribesmen had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spider living. Now he would show them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider dead. He stopped his dance of triumph and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked down the hill in haughty grandeur. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would reproach his timid followers for fleeing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spider, leaving him to kill it alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quite naively Burl assumed that it was his place</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give orders and that of the others to obey. True,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one had attempted to give orders before, or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enforce their execution, but Burl had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eminently wholesome conclusion that he was a won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful person whose wishes should be respected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl, filled with fresh notions of his own import-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, strutted on toward the hiding-place of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe, growing more and more angry with the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men for having deserted him. He would reproach</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, would probably beat them. They would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid to protest, and in the future would undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly be afraid to run away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl was quite convinced that running away</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something he could not tolerate in his followers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Obscurely--and conveniently in the extreme back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind--he reasoned that not only did a larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of men present at a scene of peril increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chances of coping with the danger, but they also</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased the chances that the victim selected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dangerous creature would be another than him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl's reasoning was unsophisticated, but sound;</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps unconscious, but none the less effective.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He grew quite furious with the deserters. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had run away! They had fled from a mere spider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shrill whine filled the air, and a ten-inch ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed at Burl with its mandibles extended threaten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly. Burl's path had promised to interrupt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">salvaging work of the insect, engaged in scraping</seg><seg type="columnLine">shreds of flesh from the corselet of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller beetles slain the previous night. The ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed at Burl like an infuriated fox-terrier, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl scurried away in undignified retreat. The ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">might not be dangerous, but bites from its formic</seg><seg type="columnLine">acid-poisoned mandibles were no trifles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl came to the tangled thicket of mushrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which his tribe-folk hid. The entrance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortuous and difficult to penetrate, and could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocked on occasion with stones and toadstool pulp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl made his way toward the central clearing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard as he went the sound of weeping, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited chatter of the tribes people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those who had fled from the rocky cliff had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned with the news that Burl was dead, and Saya</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay weeping beneath an ovfer-shadowing toadstool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was not yet the mate of Burl, but the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come when all the tribe would recognize a</seg><seg type="columnLine">status dimly different from the usual tribal relation-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl stepped into the clearing, and straightway</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuffed the first man he came upon, then the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ifext. There was a cry of astonishment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the next second instinctive, fearful glances at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that entrance to the hiding-place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had Burl fled from the spider, and was it follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing? Burl spoke loftily, saying that the spider was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead, that its legs, each one the length of a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still, and its fierce jaws and deadly poison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fangs harmless forevermore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes later he was leading an incredulous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">awed little group of pink-skinned people to the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the cliff where the spider actually lay dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the'ants busily at work upon its remains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when he went back to the hiding-place he</seg><seg type="columnLine">donned again his great cloak that was made from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wing of a magnificent moth, slain by the flames</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED DUST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">883</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the purple hills, and sat down in splendor upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumbling toadstool, to feast upon the glances of</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration and awe that were sent toward him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only Saya held back shyly, until he motioned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to draw near, when she seated herself at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and gazed up at him with unutterable adoration</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But while Burl basked in the radiance of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe's admiration, danger was drawing near them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. For many months there had been strange red</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushrooms growing slowly here and there all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, they knew. The tribe-folk had speculated</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them, but forebore tasting them because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were strange, and strange things were</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually dangerous and often fatal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now those red growths had ripened and grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to emit their spores. Their rounded tops</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grown fat, and the tough skin grew taut as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange pressure were being applied from within.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And to-day, while Burl luxuriated in his position of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared and admired great man of his tribe, at a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long distance away, upon a hill-top, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red mushrooms burst. The spores inside the taut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough skin shot all about as if scattered by an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion, and made a little cloud of reddish, im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">palpable dust, which hung in the air and moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly with the sluggish breeze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bee droned into the thin red cloud of dust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazily and heavily flying back toward the hive. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely had she entered the tinted atmosphere when</seg><seg type="columnLine">her movements became awkward and convulsive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">effortful and excited. She trembled and twisted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid air in a peculiar fashion, then dropped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, while her abdomen moved violently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bee3, like almost all insects, breathe through</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiracles on the undersurfaces of their abdomens.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This bee had breathed in some of the red mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room's spores. She thrashed about desperately</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the toadstools on which she had fallen, strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling for breath, for life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a long time she was still. The cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">red mushroom spores had strangled or poisoned her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And everywhere the red fringe grew, such explo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions were taking place, one by one, and wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red clouds hung in the air creatures were breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them in and dying in convulsions of strangula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Journey</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DARKNESS. The soft, blanketing night of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the age of fungoids had fallen over all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, and there was blackness everywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was not good to have. Here and there, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, dim, bluish lights glowed near the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There an intermittent glow showed that a fire-fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wandered far from the rivers and swamps</seg><seg type="columnLine">above which most of his kind now congregated. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faintly luminous ball of fire drifted above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming, moisture-sodden earth. It was a will-o'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">the-wisp, grown to a yard in diameter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the low-hanging banks of clouds that hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpetually overhead, large, warm raindrops fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceaselessly. A drop, a pause, and then another drop,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">added to the already dank moisture of the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The world of fungus growths flourished on just</seg><seg type="columnLine">such dampness and humidity. It seemed as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">toadstools and mushrooms could be heard, swelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and growing large in the darkness. Rustlings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealthy movements sounded furtively through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, and from above the heavy throb of mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing-beats was continuous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tribe was hidden in the midst of a tangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">copse of toadstools too thickly interwoven for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger insects to penetrate. Only the little midgets</seg><seg type="columnLine">hid in its recesses during the night-time, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller moths during the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About and among the bases of the toadstools,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, where their spongy stalks rose from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">humid earth, small beetles roamed, singing cheer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully to themselves in deep bass notes. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">small and round, some six or eight inches long, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bellies were pale gray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as they went about they emitted sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would have been chirps had they been other</seg><seg type="columnLine">than low as the lowest tone of a harp. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">truffle-beetles, in search of the dainty tidbits on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which epicures once had feasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some strange sense seemed to tell them when one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of half a dozen varieties of truffle was beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and they paused in their wandering to dig a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel straight down. A foot, two feet, or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards, all was the same to them. In time they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come upon the morsel they sought and would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main at the bottom of their temporary home until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. was consumed. Then another period of wander-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, singing their cheerful song, until another likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot was reached and another tunnel begun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a tiny, open space in the center of the toad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stool thicket the tribe-folk slept with the deep notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the truffle-beetles in their ears. A hew danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to them, but they had passed it on to Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a new and childlike confidence and considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter settled. They slept, while beneath a glow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mushroom at one side of the clearing Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled with his new problem. He squatted upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground in the dim radiance of the shining toad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stool, his moth-wing cloak wrapped about him, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear in his hand, and his twin golden plumes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moth's antennas bound to his forehead. But his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was downcast as a child's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The red mushrooms had begun to burst. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">that day, one of the women, seeking edible fungus</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the tribal larder, had seen the fat, distended</seg><seg type="columnLine">globule of the red mushroom. Its skin was stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">taut, and glistened in the light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman paid little or no attention to the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth. Her ears were attuned to catch sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would warn her of danger while her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched for tidbits that would make a meal for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe, and more particularly for her small son, left</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind at the hiding-place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A ripping noise made her start up, alert on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant. The red envelope of the mushroom had</seg><seg type="columnLine">split across the top, and a thick cloud of brownish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">red dust was spurting in every direction. It formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pyramidal cloud some thirty feet in height, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">ei.'-.rged and grew thinner with minor eddies within</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little yellow butterfly with wings barely a yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">884</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from tip to tip, flapped lazily above the mushroom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered plain. Its wings beat the air with strokes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed like playful taps upon a friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">element. The butterfly was literally intoxicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sheer joy of living. It had emerged from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its cocoon barely two hours before, and was making</seg><seg type="columnLine">its maiden flight above the strange and wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. It fluttered carelessly into the red-brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud of mushroom spores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman was watching the slowly changing</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of the spore-mist. She saw the butterfly enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brownish dust, and then her eyes became greedy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something the matter with the butter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly. Its wings no longer moved lazily and gently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They struck out in frenzied, hysterical blows that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were erratic and wild. The little yellow creature no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer floated lightly and easily, but dashed here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there, wildly and without purpose, seeming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in its death-throes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It crashed helplessly against the ground and lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, moving feebly. The woman hurried forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The wings would be new fabric with which to adorn</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself, and the fragile legs of the butterfly con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained choice meat. She entered the dust-cloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A stream of intolerable fire--though the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never seen or known of fire--burned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils and seared her lungs. She gasped in pain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the agony was redoubled. Her eyes smarted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if burning from their sockets, and tears blinded</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman instinctively turned about to flee, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">before she had gone a dozen yards--blinded as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was--she stumbled and fell to the ground. She lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, gasping, and uttering moans of pain, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the men of the tribe who had been engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in foraging near by saw her and tried to find what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had injured her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She could not speak, and he was about to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">her and tell the other tribe-folk about her when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the clicking of an ant's limbs, and rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the ant pick her to pieces bit by bit--and leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">his curiosity ungratified--the man put her across</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders and bore her back to the hiding-place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tribe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the tale the woman had told when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly recovered that caused Burl to sit alone all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night beneath the shining toadstool in the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing, puzzling his just-awakened brain to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The year before there had been no red mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms. They had appeared only recently, but Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly remembered that one day, a long time before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been a strange breeze which blew for</seg><seg type="columnLine">three day and nights, and that during the time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its blowing all the tribe had been sick and had wept</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had not yet reached the point of mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">development when he would associate that breeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a storm at a distance, or reason that the spores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the red mushrooms had been borne upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind to the present resting-places of the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungus growths. Still less could he decide that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze had not been deadly only because it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly laden with the fatal dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew simply that unknown red mushrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared, that they were everywhere about, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they would burst, and that to breathe the red</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dust they gave out was grievous sickness or death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The triba slept while the bravely attired figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl squatted under the glowing disk of the lumin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous mushroom, his face a picture of querulous per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexity, and his heart full of sadness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had consulted his strange inner self, and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan had come to him. He knew the red mushrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all about. They would fill the air with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison. He struggled with his problem while his</seg><seg type="columnLine">people slumbered, and the woman who had breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mushroom-dust sobbed softly in her troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently a figure stirred on the farther side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the olearing. Saya woke and raised her head. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Burl crouching by the shining toadstool, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gay attire draggled and unnoticed. She watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for a little, and the desolation of his pose awoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">her pity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She rose and went to his side, taking his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">between her two, while she spoke his name softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he turned and looked at her, confusion smote</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, but the misery in his face brought confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl's sorrow was inarticulate--he could not ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain this new responsibility for his people that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to him--but he was comforted by her</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence, and she sat down beside him. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time she slept, with her head resting against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side, but he continued to question himself, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued to demand an escape for his people from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffering and danger he saw ahead. With the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">an answer came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Burl had been carried down the river on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fungus raft, and had landed in the country of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army ants, he had seen great forests of edible</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushrooms, and had said to himself that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring Saya to that place. He remembered, now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the red mushrooms were there also, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of a journey remained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hunting-ground of his tribe had been free of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red fungoids until recently. If he traveled far</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough he would come to a place where there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still no red toadstools. Then came the decision.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would lead his tribe to a far country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke with stern authority when the tribes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men woke, talking in few words and in a loud voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding up his spear as he gave his orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The timid, pink-skinned people obeyed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">meekly. They had seen the body of the clotho spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had slain, and he had thrown down before them</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gray bulk of the labyrinth spider he had thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with his spear. Now he was to take them</seg><seg type="columnLine">through unknown dangers to an unknown haven,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they feared to displease him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They made light loads of their mushrooms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">such meat-stuffs as they had, and parceled out what</seg><seg type="columnLine">little fabric they still possessed. Three men bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears, in addition to Burl's long shaft, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuaded the other three to carry clubs, showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them how the weapon should be wielded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The indefinitely brighter spot in the cloud-banks</seg><seg type="columnLine">above that meant the shining sun had barely gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter of the way across the sky when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling band of timid creatures made their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their hiding-place and set out upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey. For their course, Burl depended entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon chance. He avoided the direction of the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED DUST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">885</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">however, and the path along which he had returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his people. He knew the red mushrooms grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Purely by accident he set his march toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the west, and walked cautiously on, his tribes-folk</seg><seg type="columnLine">following him fearfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl walked ahead, his spear held ready. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a figure at once brave and pathetic, ventur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing forth in a world of monstrous ferocity and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible malignance, armed only with a horny spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">borrowed from a dead insect. His velvety cloak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made from a moth's wing, hung about his figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in graceful folds, however, and twin golden plumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded jauntily from his forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him the nearly naked people followed re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luctantly. Here a woman with a baby in her arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there children of nine or ten, unable to resist the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct to play even in the presence of the manifold</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangers of the march. They ate hungrily of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumps of mushroom they had been ordered to carry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a long-legged boy, his eyes roving anxiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in search of danger followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thirty thousand years of flight from every peril</seg><seg type="columnLine">had deeply submerged the combative nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanity. After the boy came two men, one with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short spear, and the other with a club, each with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge mass of edible mushroom under his free arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and both badly frightened at the idea of fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from dangers they knew and feared to dangers they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know and consequently feared much more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So was the caravan spread out. It made its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the country with many deviations from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed line, and with many halts and pauses. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shrill stridulation filled all the air before them, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster sound compounded of innumerable clickings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and high-pitched cries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came to the tip of an eminence and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great space of ground covered with tiny black</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies locked in combat. For quite half a mile in</seg><seg type="columnLine">either direction the earth was black with ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping and biting at each other, .locked in vise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like embraces, each combatant couple trampled un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the feet of the contending armies, with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of surrender or quarter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of the clashing of fierce jaws upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">horny armor, the cries of the maimed, and strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds made by the dying, and above all, the whin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing battle-cry of each of the fighting hordes, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sustained uproar that was almost deafening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From either side of the battle-ground a pathway</seg><seg type="columnLine">led back to separate ant-cities, a pathway marked by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hurrying groups of reinforcements rushing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight. Tiny as the ants were, for once no lumber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing beetle swaggered insolently in their path, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">did the hunting-spiders mark them out for prey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only little creatures smaller than the combatants</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves made use of the insect war for purposes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These were litle gray ants barely more than four</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches long, who scurried about in and among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting creatures with marvelous dexterity, carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off, piece-meal, the bodies of the dead, and slay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the wounded for the same fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hung about the edges of the battle, and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaded the abandoned areas when the tide of battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted, insect guerillas, fighting for their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, careless of the origin of the quarrel, espous-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing no cause, simply salvaging the dead and living</seg><seg type="columnLine">debris of the combat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl and his little group of followers had to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wide detour to avoid the battle itself, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage between bodies of reinforcements hurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the scene of strife was a matter of some difficulty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ants running rapidly toward the battle-field</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hugely excited. Their antennse waved wildly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the infrequent wounded one, limping back to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the city, was instantly and repeatedly chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenged by the advancing insects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They crossed their antenna upon his, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired thorough evidence that he was of the proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">city before allowing him to proceed. Once they</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at the battle-field they flung themselves into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fray, becoming lost and indistinguishable in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tide of straining, fighting black bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men in such a battle, without distinguishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks or battle-cries, would have fought among</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves as often as against their foes, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants had a much simpler method of identification.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each ant-city possesses its individual odor--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">variant on the scent of formic acid--and each in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual of that city is recognized in his world quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply and surely by the way he smells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little tribe of human beings passed pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cariously behind a group of a hundred excited in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect warriors, and before the following group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty equally excited black insects. Burl hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">on with his following, putting many miles of peril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous territory behind before nightfall. Many times</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the day they saw the sudden billowing of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-brown dust-cloud from the earth, and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than once they came upon the empty skin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooping stalk of one of the red mushrooms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more often still they came upon the mushrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves, grown fat and taut, prepared to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">their deadly spores into the air when the pressure</seg><seg type="columnLine">from within became more than the leathery skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night the tribe hid among the bases of giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">puff-balls, which at a touch shot out a puff of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder resembling smoke. The powder was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisely the same in nature as that cast out by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red mushrooms, but its effects were marvelously--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mercifully--different; it was innocuous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl slept soundly this night, having been two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days and a night without rest, but the remainder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his tribe, and even Saya, were fearful and afraid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening ceaselessly all through the dark hours for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the menacing sounds of creatures coming to prey</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so for a week the march kept on. Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not allow his tribe to stop to forage for food.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The red mushrooms were all about. Once one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little children was caught in a whirling eddy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">red dust, and its mother rushed into the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff to seize it and bring it out. Then the tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to hide for three days while the two of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered from the debilitating poison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once, too, they found a half-acre patch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant cabbages--there were six of them full grown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a dozen or more smaller ones--and Burl took</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men and speared two of the huge, twelve-foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">slugs that fed upon the'leaves. When the tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed on it was gorged on the fat meat of the slugs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">886</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was much soft fur, so that all the tribe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk wore loin-cloths of the yellow stuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were perils, too, in the journey. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth day of the tribe's traveling, Burl froze sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly into stillness. One of the hairy tarantulas--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trap-door spider with a black belly--had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a scarabseus beetle, and was devouring it only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred yards ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tribe-folk, trembling, went back for half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile or more in panic-stricken silence, and refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to advance until he had led them a detour of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">or three miles to one side of the dangerous spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long, fear-ridden marches through perilous coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tries unknown to them, through the golden aisles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow mushroom forests, over the flaking surfaces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of plains covered with many-colored "rusts" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">molds; pauses beside turbid pools whose waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">were concealed by thick layers of green slime, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other evil-smelling ponds which foamed and bubbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, which were covered with pasty yeasts that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose in strange forms of discolored foam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fleeting glimpses they had of the glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">spokes of symmetrical spiders'-webs, whose least</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread it would have been beyond the power of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongest of the tribe to break. They passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a forest of puff-balls, which boomed when touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shot a puff of vapor from their open mouths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once they saw a long and sinuous insect that fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them and disappeared into a burrow in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, running with incredible speed upon legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of uncountable number. It was a centipede all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty feet in length, and when they crossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path it had followed a horrible stench came to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils so that they hurried on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long escape from unguessed dangers brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">boldness, of a sort, to the pink-skinned men, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would have rested. They went to Burl with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their complaint, and he simply pointed with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands behind them. There were three little clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brownish vapor in the air, where they could see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the road they had traversed. To the right of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them a dust-cloud was just settling, and to the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">another rose as they looked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A new trick of the deadly dust became apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Toward the end of a day in which they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled a long distance, one of the little children</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran a little to the left of the route its elders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">following. The earth had taken on a brownish hue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the child stirred up the surface mould with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The brownish dust that had settled there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised again, and the child ran, crying and choking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its mother, its lungs burning as with fire, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its eyes like hot coals. Another day would pass be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the child could walk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a strange country, knowing nothing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangers that might assail the tribe while waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the child to recover, Burl looked about for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding-place Far over to the right a low cliff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps twenty or thirty feet high, showed sides of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumbling, yellow clay, and from where Burl stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could see the dark openings of burrows scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there upon its face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched for a time, to see if any bee or wasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabited them, knowing that many kinds of both</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects dig burrows for their young, and do not oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupy them themselves. No dark forms appeared,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">however, and he led his people toward the openings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The appearance of the holes confirmed his sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mise. They had been dug months before by mining</seg><seg type="columnLine">bees, and the entrances were "weathered" and worn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tribe-folk made their way into the three-foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnels, and hid themselves, seizing the opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gorge themselves upon the food they carried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl stationed himself near the outer end of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the little caves to watch for signs of danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While waiting he poked curiously with his spear at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little pile of white and sticky parchment-like stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw just within the mouth of the tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly movement became visible. Fifty, sixty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a hundred tiny creatures, no more than half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch in length, tumbled pell-mell from the dirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white heap. Awkward legs, tiny, greenish-black</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, and bristles protruding in every direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">made them strange to look upon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had tumbled from the whitish heap and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">they made haste to hide themselves in it again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving slowly and clumsily, with immense effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laborious contortions of their bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had never seen any insect progress in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slow and ineffective fashion before. He drew one</seg><seg type="columnLine">little insect back with the point of his spear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined it from a safe distance. Tiny jaws before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head met like twin sickles, and the whole body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shaped like a rounded diamond lozenge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl knew that no insect of such small size could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be dangerous, and leaned over, then took one crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture in his hand. It wriggled frantically and slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped from his fingers, dropping upon the soft yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">caterpillar-fur he had about his middle. Instantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if it were a conjuring trick, the little insect van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, and Burl searched for a matter of minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he found it hidden deep in the long, soft hairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fur, resting motionless, and evidently at ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a bee-louse, the first larval form of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle whose horny armor could be seen in frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments for yards before the clayey cliff-side. Hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den in the openings of the bee's tunnel, it waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the bee-grubs farther back in their separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">cells should complete their changes of form and</seg><seg type="columnLine">'emerge into the open air, passing over the cluster</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tiny creatures at the door-way. As the bees</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass, the little bee-lice would clamber in eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste up their hairy legs and come to rest in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fur about their thoraxes. Then, weeks later, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bees in turn made other cells and stocked them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with honey for the eggs they would lay, the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures would slip from their resting-places and</seg><seg type="columnLine">be left behind in the fully provisioned cell, to eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only the honey the bee had so laboriously ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired, but the very grub hatched from the bee's</seg><seg type="columnLine">egg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had no difficulty in detaching the small in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect and casting it away, but in doing so discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">three more that had hidden themselves in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">furry garment, no doubt thinking it the coat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their natural, though unwilling hosts. He plucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">them away, and discovered more, and more. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment was the hiding-place for dozens of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Disgusted and annoyed, he went out of the cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to a spot some distance away, where he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his robe and pounded it with the flat side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spear to dislodge the visitors. They dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED DUST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">887</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out one by one, reluctantly, and finally the garment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clean of them. Then Burl heard a shout from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of the mining-bee caves, and hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then drawing toward the time of dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, but one of the tribesmen had ventured out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found no less than three of the great imperial</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushrooms. Of the three, one had been attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a parasitic purple mould, but the gorgeous yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low of the other two was undimmed, and the peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple were soon feasting upon the firm flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> B-url felt a little pang of jealousy, though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined in the consumption of the find as readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the others, and presently drew a little to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He cast his eyes across the country, level and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbroken as far as the eye could see. The small</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay cliff was the only inequality visible, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">height cut off all vision on one side. But the view</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the horizon was unobstructed on three sides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and here and there the black speck of a monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">bee could be seen, droning homeward to its hive</seg><seg type="columnLine">or burrow, and sometimes the slender form of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasp passed overhead, its transparent wings in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible from the rapidity of their vibrations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These flew high in the air, but lower down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely skimming the tops of the many-colored mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms and toadstools, fluttering lightly above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen fungoids, and touching their dainty probos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cides to unspeakable things in default of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragrant flowers that were normal food for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">races--lower down flew the multitudes of butter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies the age of mushrooms had produced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> White and yellow and red and brown, pink and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue and purple and green, every shade and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">color, every size and almost every shape, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">flitted gaily in the air. There were some so tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they would barely have shaded Burl's face, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some beneath whose slender bodies he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden himself. They flew in a riot of colors and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tihts above a world of foul mushroom growths, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turgid, slime-covered ponds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl, temporarily out of the limelight because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the discovery of a store of food by another mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the tribe, bethought himself of an idea. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">night would come on, the cloud-bank would turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">red in the west, and then darkness would lean down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward from the sky. With the coming of that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">these creatures of the day would seek hiding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">places, and the air would be given over to the furry</seg><seg type="columnLine">moths that flew by night. He, Burl, would mark the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot where one of the larger creatures alighted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would creep up upon it, with his spear held fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His wide blue eyes brightened at the thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he sat himself down to watch. After a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the soft, down-reaching fingers of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the shaded aisles of the mushroom forests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a gentle haze arose above the golden glades.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One by one the gorgeous fliers of the daytime dip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped down and furled their painted wings. The over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging clouds became darker--finally black, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slow, deliberate rainfall that lasted all through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night began. Burl rose and crept away into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness, his spear held in readiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the black night, beneath deeper black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses which were the dark undersides of huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">toadstools, creeping silently, with every sense alert</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for sign of danger or for hope of giant prey, Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his slow advance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A glorious butterfly of purple and yellow mark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, whose wings spread out for three yards on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side of its delicately formed body, had hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself barely two hundred yards away. Burl could</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine it, now, preening its slender limbs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">combing from its long and slender proboscis any</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace of the delectable foodstuffs on which it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed during the day. Burl moved slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously forward, all eyes and ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard an indescribable sound in a thicket a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to his left, and shifted his course. The sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the faint whistling of air through the breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-holes along an insect's abdomen. Then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the delicate rustling of filmy wings being stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed again, and the movement of sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbed feet upon the soft earth. Burl moved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathless silence, holding his spear before him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in readiness to plunge it into the gigantic butter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly's soft body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mushrooms here were grown thickly to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, so there was no room for Burl's body to pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">between their stalks, and the rounded heads were</seg><seg type="columnLine">deformed and misshapen from their crowdings. Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent precious moments in trying to force a silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage, but had to own himself beaten. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambered up upon the spongy mass of mushroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads, trusting to luck that they would sustain his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blackness was intense, so that even the forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of objects before him were lost in obscurity. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved forward for some ten yards, however, walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gingerly over his precarious foothold. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt rather than saw the opening before him. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">body moved below him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl raised his spear, and with a yell plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the back of the moving thing, thrusting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spear with all the force he could command. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on a shifting form, but his yell of triumph</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to a scream of terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was not the yielding body of a slender but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terfly that he-had come upon, nor had his spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">.penetrated the creature's soft flesh. He had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the shini-ng back of one of the huge, meat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating beetles, and his spear had slid across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horny armor, and then stuck fast, having pierced</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the leathery tissue between the insect's head'</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thorax.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl's terror was pitiable at the realization, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as nothing to the ultimate panic which possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him when the creature beneath him uttered a grunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fright and pain, and, spreading its stiff wing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases wide, shot upward in a crazy, panic-stricken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket-like flight toward the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Sexton-Beetles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BURL fell headforemost upon the spongy top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a huge toadstool that split with the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pact and let him through to the ground be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath, powdering him with its fine spores. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to rest with his naked shoulder half-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the yielding flesh of a mushroom-stalk, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">888</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">la? there for a seoond, catching his breath to scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he heard the whining buzz of his attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey.

Perhaps, despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mistake, he had slain this infinitely more worthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim. He rushed toward the spot where it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His wide blue eyes pierced the darkness well</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to enable him to sheer off from masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">toadstools, but he could distinguish no details--</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but forms. He heard the beetle floundering</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the ground; then heard it mount again into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, more clumsily than before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Its wing-beats no longer kept up a sustained note.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They thrashed the air irregularly and wildly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight was zigzag and uncertain, and though longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the first had been, it ended similarly, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy fall. Another period of floundering, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle took to the air again just before Burl ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived at the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was obviously seriously hurt, and Burl forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dangers of the night in his absorption in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase. He darted after his prey, fleet-footed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">agile, taking chances that in cold blood he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have thought of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice, in the pain-racked struggles of the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster beetle, he arrived at the spot where the gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect flung itself about madly, insanely, fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">it knew not what, striking out with colossal wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and legs, dazed and drunk with agony. And each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time it managed to get aloft in flight that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaker and more purposeless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crazy, fleeing from the torturing spear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">pierced its very vitals, the beetle blundered here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there, floundering among the mushroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickets in spasms that were constantly more pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed and more agonized, but nevertheless flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily, lurching drunkenly, managing to graze the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tops of the toadstools in one more despairing, tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Burl followed, aflame with the fire of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase, arriving at the scene of each successive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic-stricken struggle on the ground just after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle had taken flight again, but constantly more</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely on the heels of the weakening monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last he came up panting, and found the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying upon the earth, moving feebly, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to rise. How far he was from the tribe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl did not know, nor did the question occur</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him at the moment. He waited for the beetle</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be still, trembling with excitement and eager-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. The struggles of the huge form grew more</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble, and at last ceased. Burl moved forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped his spear. He wrenched at it to thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an instant the beetle had roused itself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exerting its last atom of strength, galvanized</seg><seg type="columnLine">into action by the agony caused by Burl's seizure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the spear. A great wing-cover knocked Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet, and flung him against the base of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushroom, where he lay, half stunned. But then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strangely pungent scent came to his nostrils--i</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scent of the red mushrooms!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He staggered to his feet and fled, while behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the gigantic beetle crashed and floundered--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl heard a tearing and ripping sound. The in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect had torn the covering of one of the red mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms, tightly packed with the fatal red dust. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise, Burl's speed was doubled, but he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">still hear the frantic struggles of the dying beetle</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow to a very crescendo of desperation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The creature broke free and managed to rise in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a final flight, fighting for breath and life, weakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tortured by the spear and the horrible spores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the red mushrooms. Then it crashed suddenly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth and was still. The red dust had killed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In time to come, Burl might learn to use the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust as poison gas had been used by his ancestors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thirty thousand years before, but now he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened and alone, lost from his tribe, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no faintest nation of how to find them. He crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath a huge toadstool and waited for dawn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening with terrified apprehension for the ripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound that would mean the bursting of another of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red mushrooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only the wing beats of night-flying creatures came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his ears, however, and the discordant noises of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four-foot truffle-beetles as they roamed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aisles of the mushroom forests, seeking the places</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath which their instinct told them fungoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">dainties awaited the courageous miner. The eternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping of the rain-drops falling at long intervals</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the overhanging clouds formed a soft ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bligato to the whole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl listened, knowing there were red toadstools</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about, but not once during the whole of the long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark hours did the rending noise tell of a bursting</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungus casting loose its freight of deadly dust upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. Only when day came again, and the chill</seg><seg type="columnLine">dampness of the night was succeeded by the steam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing humidity of the morning, did a tall pyramid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brownish-red stuff leap suddenly into the air from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ripped mushroom covering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Burl stood up and looked around. Here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, all over the whole countryside, slowly and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals, the cones of fatal red sprang into the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had Burl lived thirty thousand years earlier, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have likened the effect to that of shells</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursting from a leisurely bombardment, but as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was he saw in them only fresh and inexorable</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangers added to an already peril-ridden existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hundred yards from where he had hidden dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the night the body of his victim lay, crumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and limp. Burl approached speculatively. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come even before the ants appeared to take their</seg><seg type="columnLine">toll of the carcass, and not even a buzzing flesh-fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">had placed its maggots on the unresisting form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The long, whiplike antennas lay upon the carpet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mold and rust, and the fiercely toothed legs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn close against the body. The many-faceted</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes stared unseeingly, and the stiff and horny wing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases were rent and torn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Burl went to the other side of the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle he saw something that filled him with elation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His spear had been held between his body and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle's during that mad flight, and at the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash, when Burl shot away from the fear-crazed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect, the weight of his body had forced the spear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point between the joints of the corselet and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck. Even if the red dust had not finished the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED DUST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">889</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">creature, the spear wound in time would have ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">its life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl was thrilled once more by his superlative</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatness, and conveniently forgot that it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red dust that had actually administered the coup</seg><seg type="columnLine">de grace. It was so much more pleasant to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon himself as the mighty slayer that he hacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">off one of the barb-edged limbs to carry back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe in evidence of his feat. He took the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">antennje, too, as further proof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he remembered that he did not know where</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tribe was to be found. He had no faintest idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the direction in which the beetle had flown. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of fact, the course of the beetle had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in turn directed toward every point of the compass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was no possible way of telling the relation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its final landing-place to the point from which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl wrestled with his problem for an hour, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then gave up in disgust. He set off at random,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the leg of the huge insect flung over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and the long antennie clasped in his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his spear. He turned to look at his victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night before just before plunging into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">near-by mushroom forest, and saw that it was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready the center of a mass of tiny black bodies, pull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and hacking at the tough armor, and carving</seg><seg type="columnLine">out great lumps of the succulent flesh to be carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the near-by ant city.	'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the teeming life of the insect world death is</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opportunity for the survivors. There is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely tense and fearful competition for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies of the slain. There had been barely an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">of daylight in which the ants might seek for pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vender, yet in that little time the freshly killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle had been found and was being skilfully and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully exploited. When the body of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger insects fell to the ground, there was a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush, a fierce race, among all the tribes of scaven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers to see who should be first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Usually the ants had come upon the scene and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were inquisitively exploring the carcass long be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore even the flesh-flies had arrived, who dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">their living maggots upon the creature. The blue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottles came still later, to daub their masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white eggs about the delicate membranes of the eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And while all the preceding scavengers were at</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, furtive beetles and tiny insects burrowed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low the reeking body to attack the highly scented</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh from a fresh angle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each working independently of the others, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">commonly appeared in the order of the delicacy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sense which could lead them to a source of food,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though accident could and sometimes did afford one</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of workers in putrescence an advantage over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, sometimes a blue-bottle anticipated even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eager ants, and again the very flesh-flies drop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped their squirming offspring upon a limp form that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already being undermined by white-bellied</seg><seg type="columnLine">things working in the darkness below the body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl grimaced at the busy ants and buzzing flies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappeared into the mushroom forest. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time he moved cautiously and silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the aisles of tangled stalks and the spongy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">round heads of the fungoids. Now and then he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the red toadstools, and made a wide detour</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">around it. Twice they burst within his sight, cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumscribed as his vision was by the toadstools</seg><seg type="columnLine">among which he was traveling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each time he ran hastily to put as much distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible between himself and the deadly red dust.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He traveled for an hour or more, looking constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for familiar landmarks that might guide him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe. He knew that if he came upon any place he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen while with his tribe he could follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path they had traveled and in time rejoin them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For many hours he went on, alert for signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. He was quite ignorant of the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">therewere such thingsas points of the compass, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he had a distinct notion that he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving in a straight line, he did not realize that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was actually moving in a colossal half-circle. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking steadily for nearly four hours he was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than three miles in a direct line from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting-point. As it happened, his uncertainty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction was fortunate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night before the tribe had been feeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">happily upon one of the immense edible mushrooms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they heard Burl's abruptly changing cry. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had begun as a shout of triumph, and ended as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream of fear. Then they heard hurried wing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beats as a creature rose into the air in a scurry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperation. The throbbing of huge wings ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a heavy fall, followed by another flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Velvety darkness masked the sky, and the tribes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men could only stare off into the blackness, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">their leader had vanished, and begin to tremble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering what they should do in a strange country</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no bold chief to guide them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was the first man to whom the tribe had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered allegiance, but their submission had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the more complete for that fact, and his loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the more appalling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had mistaken their lack of timidity. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thought it independence, and indifference to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. As a matter of fact, it was security because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tribe felt safe under his tutelage. Now that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had vanished, and in a fashion that seemed to mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">his death, their old fears returned to them reen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced by the strangeness of their surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They huddled together and whispered their .</seg><seg type="columnLine">fright to one another, listening the while in panic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken apprehension for signs of danger. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribesmen visualized Burl caught in fiercely toothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs, being rent and torn in mid air by horny, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">satiable jaws, his blood falling in great spurts to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the earth below. They caught a faint, reedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry, and shuddered, pressing closer together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so through the long night they waited in</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling silence. Had a hunting spider appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them they would not have lifted a hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">defend themselves, but would have fled despairingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would probably have scattered and lost touch with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another, and spent the remainder of their lives</seg><seg type="columnLine">as solitary fugitives, snatching fear-ridden rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in strange hiding-places.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But day came again, and they looked into each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's eyes, reading in each the selfsame panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fear. Saya was probably the most pitiful oi</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the group. Burl was to have been her mate, ant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face was white and drawn beyond that of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the nest of the tribefolk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wljfch £he das, they did not move, lint reclamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">890</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">clustered about the huge mushroom on which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been feeding the night before. They spoke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hushed and fearful tones, huddled together, search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all the horizon for insect enemies. Saya would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not eat, but sat still, staring before her in unseeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifference. Burl was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hundred yards from where they crouched a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushroom glistened in the pale light of the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. Its tough skin was taut and bulging, resisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure of the spores within. But slowly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning wore on, some of the moisture that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept the skin soft and flaccid during the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">evaporated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The skin had a strong tendency to contract, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">green leather when drying. The spores within it</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to expand. The opposing forces produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tension that grew greater and greater as more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the moisture was absorbed by the air. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last the skin could hold no longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a ripping sound that could be heard for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of feet, the tough wrapping split and tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">across its top, and with a hollow, booming noise the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compressed mass of deadly spores rushed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, making a pyramidal cloud of brown-red dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sixty feet in height.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tribesmen quivered at the noise and faced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust cloud for a fleeting instant, then ran pell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mell to escape the slowly moving tide of death as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the almost imperceptible breeze wafted it slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them. Men and women, boys and girls, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled in a mad rush from the deadly stuff, not paus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to see that even as it advanced it settled slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground, nor stopping to observe its path that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might step aside and let it go safely by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saya fled with the rest, but without their ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treme panic. She fled because the others had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">so,, and ran more carelessly, struggling with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-formed idea that it did not particularly matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether she were caught or not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She fell slightly behind the others, without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed. Then quite abruptly a stone turned under</seg><seg type="columnLine">her foot, and she fell headlong, striking her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently against a second stone. Then she lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite still while the red cloud billowed slowly to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward her, drifting gently in the faint, hardly per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptible breeze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It drew nearer and nearer, settling slowly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">still a huge and menacing mass of deadly dust. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually flattened out, too, so that though it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a rounded cone at first, it flowed over the minor</seg><seg type="columnLine">inequalities of the ground as a huge and tenuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">leech might have crawled, sucking from all breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing creatures the life they had within them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hundred and fifty yards away, a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, then only fifty yards away. From where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saya lay unconscious on the earth, eddies within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving mass could be seen, and the edges took on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">striated appearance, telling of the curling of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust wreaths in the larger mass of deadly powder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The deliberate advance kept on, seeming almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposeful. It would have seemed possible to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the unhurried, menacing movement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisonous stuff that some malign intelligence was</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed in it, that it was, in fact, a living crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. But when the misty edges of the cloud were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than twenty-five yards from Saya's pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate body a breeze from one side sprang up--a,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vagrant, fitful little breeze, that first halted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red cloud and threw it into confusion and then drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to one side, so that it passed Saya without harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her, though a single trailing wisp of dark-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist floated very close to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then for a time Saya lay still indeed, only her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast rising and falling gently with faint and ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular breaths. Her head had struck a sharp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged stone in her fall, and a tiny pool of sticky</seg><seg type="columnLine">red had gathered from the wound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps thirty feet from where she lay, three</seg><seg type="columnLine">small toadstools grew in a little clump, their bases</seg><seg type="columnLine">so close together that they seemed but one. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two of them, however, just where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted, twin tufts of reddish threads appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinkling back and forth, and in and out. As if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had given some reassuring sign, two slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">antenna followed, then bulging eyes, and then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small black body which had bright-red scalloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">markings upon the wing-cases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a tiny beetle no more than eight inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">long--a burying-beetle. It drew near Saya's body</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clambered upon her, explored the ground by her</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, moving all the time in feverish haste, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last dived into the ground beneath her shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">casting back a little shower of hastily dug earth as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes later another similar insect appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and upon the heels of the second a third. Each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them made the same hasty examination, and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">dived under the still form. Presently the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to billow at a spot along Saya's side, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">at another. Perhaps ten minutes after the arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the third beetle a little rampart had reared itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about Saya's body, precisely following the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of her form. Then her body moved slightly, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of tiny jerks, and seemed to settle per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps half an inch into the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The burying beetles were of those who exploited</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bodies of the fallen. Working from below, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">excavated the earth from the under side of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">prizes as they came upon, then turned upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs and thrust with their legs, jerking the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">so it sank into the shallow excavation they had pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The process would be repeated until at last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole of the gift of fortune had sunk below the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding surface and the loosened earth fell in up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the top, thus completing the inhumation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then in the darkness the beetles would feast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear their young, gorging upon the plentiful supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">of succulent foodstuff they had hidden from jealous</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow scavengers above them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Saya was alive. Thirty thousand years be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, when scientists examined into the habits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burying-beetles, or the sexton-beetles, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared that fresh meat or living meat would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be touched. They based their statement solely upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that the insects (then tiny creatures in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed) did not appear until the trap-meat placed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the investigators had remained untouched for days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conditions had changed in thirty thousand years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ever-present ants and the sharp-eyed flies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen rivals of the brightly arrayed beetles. Usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tribes of creatures who worked in the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">below ground came after the ants had taken their</seg><seg type="columnLine">toll, and the flies sipped daintily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED DUST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">891</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Saya fell unconscious upon the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, it was the one accident that caused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burying-beetle to find her first, before the ants had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to tear the flesh from her slender, soft-skinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. She breathed gently and irregularly, her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn with the sorrow of the night before, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately hurrying beetles swarmed beneath her</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, channeling away the earth so that she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">sink lower and lower into the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An inch, and a long wait. Then she sank slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second inch. The bright-red tufts of thread ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared again, and a beetle made his way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open air. He ntioved hastily about, inspecting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress of the work. He dived below again. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other inch, and after a long time another inch was</seg><seg type="columnLine">excavated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl stepped out from a group of over-shadowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">toadstools and halted. He cast his eyes over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landscape, and was struck by its familiarity. It was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in point of fact, very near the spot he had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night before, in pursuit of a colossal wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl moved back and forth, trying to account for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sensation of recognition, and then trying to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximate the place from which he had last seen it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He passed within fifty feet of the spot where Saya</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay, now half buried in the ground. The loose earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast up about her body had begun to fall in little</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivulets upon her. One of her shoulders was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready screened from view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl passed on, unseeing. He was puzzling over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction from which he had seen the particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of countryside before him. Perhaps a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther on he would come to the place. He hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little. In a moment he recognized his location.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was the great edible mushroom, half broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, from which the tribe had been feeding. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the mining bee burrows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His feet stirred up a fine dust, and he stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">short. A red mushroom had covered the earth with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin layer of its impalpable, deadly powder. Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood why the tribe had gone, and a cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat came upon his body. Was Saya safe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or had the whole tribe succumbed to the poisonous</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff? Had they all, men and women and children,</seg><seg type="columnLine">died in convulsions of gasping strangulation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hurried to retrace his footsteps. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fragment of mushrooms on the ground. Here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spear, cast away by one of the tribesmen in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight. Burl broke into a run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little excavation into which Saya was sink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, inch by inch, was all of twenty-five feet to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right of the path. Burl dashed on, frantic with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety about the tribe, but most of all about Saya.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saya's body quivered and sank a fraction more into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half a dozen litle rivulets of dirt were tumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her body now. In a matter of minutes she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be hidden from view. Burl ran madly past</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, too busy searching the mushroom thickets be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him with his eyes to dream of looking upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty yards from a huge toadstool thicket</seg><seg type="columnLine">a noise arrested him sharply. There was a crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and breaking of the brittle, spongy growths. Twin</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapering antennae appeared, and then a monster</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle lurched into the open space, its norrible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaping jaws stretched wide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was all of eight feet long, and its body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">held up from the ground by six crooked, saw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toothed limbs. Its huge multiple eyes stared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinelike preoccupation at the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It advanced deliberately, with a clanking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clashing as of a hideous machine. Burl fled on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant, running as madly away from the beetle as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had a moment before been running toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little depression in the earth was before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not swerve, but made to leap it. As he shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it, however, the glint of pink skin caught his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye, and there was impressed upon his brain with</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographic completeness the picture of Saya, ly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing limp and helpless, sinking slowly into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, with tiny rills of earth falling down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of -the excavation upon her. It seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl's eye that she quivered slightly as he saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a terrific struggle within Burl. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him the colossal meat-eating beetle. Beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">him Saya, whom he loved. There was certain death</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurching toward him on evilly glittering legs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was life for his race and tribe lying in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallow pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned, aware with a sudden reckless glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was throwing away his life, aware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was deliberately giving himself over to death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood on the side of the little pit nearest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great beetle, his puny spear held defiantly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready. In his left hand he held just such a leg as</seg><seg type="columnLine">those which bore the living creature toward him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had torn it from the body of just such a mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster but a few hours ago, a monster in whose death</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had had a share. With a yell of insane defiance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he flung the fiercely toothed limb at his advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">opponent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sharp teeth cut into the base of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle's antennas, and it ducked clumsily, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the missile in its fierce jaws and crushed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in frenzy of rage. There was meat within it, sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and juicy meat that pleased the beetle's palate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It forgot the man, standing there, waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. It crunched the missile that had attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, eating the palatable contents of the horny armor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusing the blow with the object that had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livered it, and evidently satisfied that an enemy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been conquered and was being devoured. A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later it turned and lumbered off to investigate an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other mushroom thicket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Burl turned quickly and dragged Saya's</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp form from the grave that had been prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it by the busy insect scavengers. Earth fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her shoulders, from her hair, and from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of yellow fur about her middle, and three little</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetles with black and red markings scurried in</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrified haste for cover, while Burl bore Saya to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting-place of soft mold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl was an ignorant savage, and to him Saya's</seg><seg type="columnLine">deathlike unconsciousness was like death itself, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumb misery smote him, v and he laid her down</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently, while tears came to his eyes and he called</seg><seg type="columnLine">her name again and again in an agony of grief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an hour he sat there beside her, a man so</seg><seg type="columnLine">lately pleased with himself above all creatures for</seg><seg type="columnLine">having slain one huge beetle and put another to</seg><seg type="columnLine">892</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flight, as he would have looked upon it, now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken-hearted, little pink-skinned man, weeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a child, hunched up and bowed over with sorrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Saya slowly opened her eyes and stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Forest of Death</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY were oblivious to everything but each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, Saya resting in still half-incredulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness against Burl's' shoulder while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her in little, jerky sentences of his pursuit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colossal flying beetle, of his search for the tribe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then his discovery of her apparently lifeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he spoke of the monster that had lurched</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mushroom thicket, and of the desperation</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which he had faced it, Saya pressed close and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at him with wondering and wonderful eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She could understand his willingness to die, believ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her dead. A little while before she had felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same indifference to life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A timid, frightened whisper roused them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their absorption, and they looked up. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribesmen stood upon one foot some distance away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at them, almost convinced that he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the living dead. A sudden movement on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of either of them would have sent him in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic back into the mushroom forest. Two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">blond heads bobbed and vanished among the tanglad</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalks. Wide and astonished eyes gazed at the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had believed the prey of malignant creatures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tribe had come slowly back to the mushroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been eating, leaderless, and convinced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saya had fallen a victim to the deadly dust. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead, they found her sitting by the side of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, apparently restored to them in some mirac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulous fashion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl spoke, and the pink-skinned people came</seg><seg type="columnLine">timorously from their hiding-places. They ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached warily and formed a half-circle before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated pair. Burl spoke again, and presently one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bravest dared approach and touch him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly a babble of the crude and labial language</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken by the tribe broke out. Awed questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and exclamations of thankfulness, then curious in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrogations filled the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl, for once, showed some common sense. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of telling them in his usual vainglorious</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion of the adventures he had undergone, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely cast down the two long and tapering</seg><seg type="columnLine">antennas from the flying beetle that he had torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its dead body. They looked at them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized their origin. Amazement and admiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed upon their faces. Then Burl rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly ordered two of the men to make a chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their hands for Saya. She was weak from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects of the blow she had received. The two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">humbly advanced and did as they were bid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the march was taken up again, more slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">than before, because of Saya as a burden, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">none the less steadily. Burl led his people across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country, marching in advance and with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve alert for signs of danger, but with more con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence and less timidity than he had ever displayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that noontime and that afternoon they filed</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily along, the tribesfolk keeping in a compact</seg><seg type="columnLine">group close behind Burl. The man who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown away his spear had recovered it on an order</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Bur], and the little party fairly bristled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons, though Burl knew well that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">liable to be cast away as impediments if flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was determined that his people should learn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight the great creatures about them, instead of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pending upon their legs for escape. He had led</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in an attack upon great slugs, but they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">defenseless creatures, incapable of more dangerpus</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuvers than spasmodic jerkings of their great</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next time danger should threaten them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially if it came while their new awe of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">held good, he was resolved to force them to join</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in fighting it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had not long to wait for an opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strengthen the spirit of his followers by a success-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful battle. The clouds toward the west were taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a dull-red hue, which was the nearest to a sunset</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was ever seen in the world of Burl's experience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a bumble bee droned heavily over their heads,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making for its hive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little group of people on the ground looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and saw a scanty load of pollen packed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiff bristles of the insect's hind legs. The bees of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world had a hard time securing food upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly flowerless planet, but this one had evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a find. Its crop was nearly filled with hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered, viscous honey destined for the hival store.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It sped onward, heavily, its almost transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings mere blurs in the air from the rapidity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their vibration. Burl saw its many-faceted eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring before it in worried preoccupation as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">soared'in laborious speed over his head, some fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped his glance, and then his eyes lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with excitement. A slender-bodied wasp was shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upward from an ambush it had found in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicket of toadstools. It darted swiftly and grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully upon the bee, which swerved and tried to flee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The droning buzz of the bee's wings rose to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher note as it strove to increase its speed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">more delicately formed wasp headed the clumsier in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bee turned again and fled in terror. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the insects was slightly more than four feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, but the bee was much the heavier, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not attain the speed of which the wasp was</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The graceful form of the hunting insect rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhauled its fleeing prey, and the wasp dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and closed with the bee at a point almost over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heads of the tribesmen. In a clawing, biting</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle of thrashing, transparent wings and black</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, the two creatures tumbled to the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They fell perhaps thirty yards from where Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood watching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over and over the two insects rolled, now one</seg><seg type="columnLine">uppermost, and then the other. The bee was strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling desperately to insert her sting in the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">supple body of her adversary. She writhed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED DUST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">893</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted, fighting with jaw and mandible, wing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">claw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wasp was uppermost, and the bee lay on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, fighting in panic-stricken desperation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasp saw an opening, her jaws darted in, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an instant of confusion. Then suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bee, dazed, was upright with the wasp upon her. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement too quick for the eye to follow--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bee collapsed. The wasp had bitten her in the neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">where all the nerve-cords passed, and the bee was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl waited a moment more, aflame with excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. He knew, as did all the tribefolk, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">might happen next. When he saw the second act</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tragedy well begun, Burl snapped quick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">harsh orders to his spear-armed men, and they fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed him in a wavering line, their weapons tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Knowing the habits of the insects as they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to know them, they knew that the venture</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one of the least dangerous they could under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take with fighting creatures the size of the wasp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the idea of attacking the great creatures whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp stings could- annihilate any of them with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch, the mere thought of taking the initiative was</seg><seg type="columnLine">appalling. Had their awe of Burl been less complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would not have dreamed of following him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second act of the tragedy had begun. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bee had been slain by the wasp, a carnivorous in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect normally, but the wasp knew that sweet honey</seg><seg type="columnLine">was concealed in the half-filled crop of the bee. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bee arrived safely at the hive, the sweet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticky liquid would have been disgorged and added</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the hival store. Now, though the bee's journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ended and its flesh was to be crunched and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voured by the wasp, the honey was the first object</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pirate's solicitude.* The dead insect was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled over upon its back, and with eager haste the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slayer began to exploit the body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl and his men were creeping nearer, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gesture Burl bade them halt for a moment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasp's first move was to force the disgorgement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the honey from the bee's crop, and with feverish</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerness it pressed upon the limp body until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining, sticky liquid appeared. Then the wasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">began in ghoulish ecstasy to lick up the sweet stuff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly absorbed in the feast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many thousands of years before, the absorption</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the then tiny insect had been noticed when</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged in a similar feat, and it was recorded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">books moldered into dust long ages before Burl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">birth that its rapture was so great that it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to fall a victim to a second bandit while</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged in the horrible banquet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had never read the books, but he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">told that the pirate would continue its feast even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though seized by a greater enemy, unable to tear it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self from the nectar gathered by the creature it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had slain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tribesmen waited until the wasp had begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">its orgy, licking up the toothsome stuff disgorged</seg><seg type="columnLine">by its dead prey It ate in gluttonous haste, blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all sights, deaf to all sounds, able to think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, conceive of nothing, but the delights of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid it was devouring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a signal the tribesmen darted forward. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wavered when near the slender-waisted gourmet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, and Burl was the first to thrust his spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all his strength into the thinly armored body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the others took courage. A short, horny</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear penetrated the very vitals of the wasp. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">club fell with terrific impact upon the slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist. There was a crackling, and the long, spidery</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs quivered and writhed, while the tribesmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell back in fear, but without cause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl struck again, and the wasp fell into two</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhing halves, helpless for harm. The pink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinned men danced in triumph, and the women and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children ventured near, delighted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only Burl noticed that even as the wasp was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying, sundered and pierced with spears, its slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue licked out in one last, ecstatic taste of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nectar that had been its undoing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burdened with the pollen-covered legs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant bee, and filled with the meat from choice por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the wasp's muscular limbs, the tribe re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed its journey. This time Burl had men behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, still timid, still prone to flee at the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm, but infinitely more dependable than they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had attacked and slain a wasp whose sting</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have killed any of them. They had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle under the leadership of Burl, whose spear</seg><seg type="columnLine">had struck the first blow. Henceforth they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharers, in a mild way, of his transcendent glory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and henceforth they were more like followers of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty chief and less like spineless worshipers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a demigod whose feats they were too timid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">emulate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night they hid among a group of giant puff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">balls, feasting on the-loads of meat they had carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus far with them. Burl watched them now with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out jealousy of their good spirits. He and Saya sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little apart, happy to be near each other, speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in low tones. After a time darkness fell, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribefolk became shapeless bodies speaking in voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">that grew drowsy and were silent. The black forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the toadstool heads and huge puffballs were but</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker against a dark sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nightly rain began to fall, drop by drop, drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">by drop, upon the damp and humid earth. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl remained awake for a little while, and his last</seg><seg type="columnLine">waking thought was of pride, disinterested pride.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had the first reward of the ruler, gratification</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the greatness of his people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The red mushrooms had continued to show their</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening heads, though Burl thought they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">less numerous than in the territory from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tribe had fled. All along the route, now to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, now to the left, they had burst and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">their masses of deadly dust into the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many times the tribefolk had been forced to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a detour to avoid a slowly spreading cloud of death-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealing spores.

Only the obvious disadvantages</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such a course--the difficulty of discovering food,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the prowling spiders that roamed in the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness--had prevented him. The idea still stayed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•The Dirate is the Philanthus Ativorus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">894</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, however, and two days after the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the hunting wasp he put it in practise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tribe came to the top of a small rise in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. For an hour they had been marching and</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter-marching to avoid the suddenly appearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds of dust. Once they had been nearly hemmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, and only by mad sprinting did they escape when</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of the dull-red clouds seemed to flow together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing three sides of a circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came to the little hillock and halted. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore them stretched a plain all of four miles wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored a brownish brick-red by masses of mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms. They had seen mushroom forests before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knew of the dangers they presented, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was none so deadly as the plain before them. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and left it stretched as far as the eye could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, but far away on its farther edge Burl caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glimpse of flowing water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over the plain itself a dull-red haze seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">float. It was nothing more or less than a cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the deadly spores, dispersed and indefinite, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly replenished by the freshly bursting red</seg><seg type="columnLine">mushrooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the people stood and watched a dozen thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns of dust rose into the air from scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">points here and there upon the plain, settling slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, but leaving behind them enough of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">finely divided substance to keep the thin red haze</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the whole plain in its original, deadly state.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had seen single red mushrooms before, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even small thickets of two and three, but here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plain of millions, literally millions upon millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the malignant growths. Here was one fungoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest through whose aisles no monster beetles</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalked, and above whose shadowed depths no</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly colored butterflies fluttered in joyous</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon. There were no loud-voiced crickets sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in its hiding-places, nor bodies of eagerly for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aging ants searching inquisitively for bits of food.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a forest of death, still and silent, quiet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless save for the sullen columns of red dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ever and again shot upward from the torn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged envelope of the bursting mushroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl and his people watched in wonderment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismay, but presently a high resolve came to Burl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The mushrooms never burst at night, and the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust from a subsided cloud was not deadly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning. As a matter of fact the rain that fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">every night made it no more than a sodden, thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">film of reddish mud by daybreak, mud which dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl did not know what occurred, but knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result. At night or in early morning, the danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the red mushrooms was slight. Therefore he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would lead his people through the very jaws of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death that night. He would lead them through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly aisles of this, the forest of malignant</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths, the place of lurking annihilation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an act of desperation, and the resolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry it through left Burl in a state of mind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept him from observing one thing that would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended all the struggles of his tribe at once. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps a quarter-mile from the edge of the red forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">three or four giant cabbages grew, thrusting their</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal leaves upward toward the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And on the cabbages a dozen lazy slugs fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">leisurely, ignoring completely the red haze that was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">never far from them and sometimes covered them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl saw them, but the oddity of their immunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the effects of the red dust did not strike him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was fighting to keep his resolution intact. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had only realized the significance of what he saw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slugs were covered with a thick soft fur. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribespeople wore garments of that same material.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fur protected the slugs, and could have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tribe immune to the deadly red dust if they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only known. The slugs breathed through a row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny holes upon their backs, as the mature insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed through holes upon the bottom of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">abdomens, and the soft fur formed a mat of felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">which arrested the fine particles of deadly dust, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowing the pure air to pass through. It formed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in effect, a natural gas-mask which the tribesmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have adopted, but which they did not dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover or invent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The remainder of that day they waited in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious mixture of resolve and fear. The tribe was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly reaching a point where it would follow Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a thousand-foot cliff, and it needed some such</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind confidence to make them prepare to go through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest of the million deadly mushrooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The waiting was a strain, but the actual journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a nightmare. Burl knew that the toadstools</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not burst of themselves during the night, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that the beetle on which He had taken his</seg><seg type="columnLine">involuntary ride had crashed against one in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, and that the fatal dust had poured out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He warned his people to be cautious, and led them</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the slope of the hill through the blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For hours they stumbled on in utter darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the pungent, acrid odor of the red growths con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly in their nostrils. They put out their hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and touched the flabby, damp stalks of the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous things. They stumbled and staggered against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leathery skins of the malignant fungoids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Death was all about them. At no time during</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the dark hours of the night was there a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they could not reach out their hands and touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fungus growth that might burst at their touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fill the air with poisonous dust, so that all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them would die in gasping, choking agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And worst of all, before half an hour was past</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had lost all sense of direction, so that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled on blindly through the utter blackness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not knowing whether they were headed toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river that might be their salvation or were wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering hopelessly deeper and deeper into the silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of the forest of strangled things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When day came again and the mushrooms sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">their columns of fatal dust into the air would they</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasp and fight for breath in the red haze that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">float like a tenuous cloud above the forest? Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">they breathe in flames of firelike torment and die</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, or would the red dust be merciful and slay</seg><seg type="columnLine">them quickly?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They felt their way like blind folk, devoid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope and curiously unafraid. Only their hearts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">like heavy, cold weights in their breasts, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered aside the swollen sacs of the red mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms with a singular apathy as they followed Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly through the midst of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many times in their journeying they knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead creatures were near by--moths, perhaps, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED DUST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">895</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had blundered into a distended growth which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst upon the impact and killed the thing that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No busy insect scavengers ventured into this</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain of silence to salvage the bodies, however. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">red haze preserved the sanctuary of malignance in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">violate. During the day no creature might hope to</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach its red aisles and dust-carpeted clearings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at night the slow-dropping rain fell only upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rounded heads of the mushrooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In all the space of the forest, only the little band</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hopeless people, plodding on behind Burl in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">velvet blackness, callously rubbed shoulders with</seg><seg type="columnLine">death in the form of the red and glistening mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms. Over all the dank expanse of the forest, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only sound was the dripping of the slow and sodden</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainfull that began at nightfall and lasted until day</seg><seg type="columnLine">came again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sky began to grow faintly gray as the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose behind the banks of overhanging clouds. Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped short and uttered what was no more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a groan. He was in a little circular clearing, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted, monstrous forms of the deadly mushrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all about. There was not yet enough light</seg><seg type="columnLine">for colors to appear, and the hideous, almost obscene</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes of the loathsome growths on every side</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed only as mocking, leering silhouettes as of</seg><seg type="columnLine">malicious demons rejoicing at the coming doom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gray-faced, huddled tribefolk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl stood still, drooping in discouragement upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spear, the feathery moth's antennse bound upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his forehead shadowed darkly against the graying</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. Soon the mushrooms would begin to burst--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, suddenly, he lifted his head, encourage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and delight upon his features. He had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ripple of running water. His followers looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him with dawning hope. Without a word, Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to run, and they followed him more slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His voice came back to them in a shout of delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they, too, broke into a jog-trot. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment they had emerged from the thick tangle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brownish-red stalks and were upon the banks of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide and swiftly running river, the same river</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose gleam Burl had caught the day before from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farther side of the mushroom forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once before Burl had floated down a river upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mushroom raft. Then his journey had been in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluntary and unlooked for. He had been carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">far from his tribe and far from Saya, and his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been filled with desolation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he viewed the swiftly running current with</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager delight. He cast his eyes up and down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. Here and there the river-bank rose in a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluff, and thick shelf-growths stretched out above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl was busy in an instant, stabbing the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths with his spear and striving to wrench them</seg><seg type="columnLine">free. The tribesmen stared at him, uncomprehend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but at an order from him they did likewise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon a dozen thick masses of firm, light fungus</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay upon the shore where it shelved gently into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. Burl began to explain what they were to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but one or two of the men dared remonstrate, say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing humbly that they were afraid to part from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If they might embark upon the same thing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, they would be safe, but otherwise they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl cast an apprehensive glance at the sky. Day</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming rapidly on. Soon the red mushrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">would begin to shoot their columns of deadly dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air. This was no time to pause and deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate. Then Saya spoke softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl listened, and made a mighty sacrifice. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his gorgeous velvet cloak from his shoulders--</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was made from the wing of a great moth--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore it into a dozen long, irregular pieces, tearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it along the lines of the sinews that reinforced it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He planted his spear upright in the largest piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shelf-fungus and caused his followers to do like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise, then fastened the strips of sinew and velvet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his spear-shaft, and ordered them to do the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other spears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a matter of minutes the dozen tiny rafts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bobbing on the water, clustered about the larger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">central bit. Then, one by one, the tribefolk took</seg><seg type="columnLine">their places, and Burl shoved off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The agglomeration of cranky, unseaworthy bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf-fungus moved slowly out from the shore until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current caught it. Burl and Saya sat upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">central bit, with the other trustful but somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened pink-skinned people all about them. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they began to move between the mushroom-lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks of the river and the mist of the night began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lift from its surface, far in the interior of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest of the red fungoids a column of sullen red</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped into the air. The first of the malignant</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths had cast its cargo of poisonous dust into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the still-humid atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conelike column spread out and grew thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but even after it had sunk into the earth, a reddish</seg><seg type="columnLine">taint remained in the air about the place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been. The deadly red haze that hung all</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the day over the red forest was in process</seg><seg type="columnLine">of formation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But by that time the unstable fungus rafts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">far down the river, bobbing and twirling in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current, with the wide-eyed people upon them gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in wonderment at the shores as they glided by. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">red mushrooms grew less numerous upon the banks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other growths took their places. Molds and rusts</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the ground as grass had done in ages past.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mushrooms showed their creamy, rounded heads.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malformed things with swollen trunks and branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">in strange mockery of the trees they had superseded</seg><seg type="columnLine">made their appearance, and once the tribesmen saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark bulk of a hunting spider outlined for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment upon the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the long day they rode upon the current,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the insect life that had been absent in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighborhood of the forest of death made its ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance again. Bees once more droned overhead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wasps and dragon-flies. Four-inch mosquitoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">made their appearance, to be fought off by the tribe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk with lusty blows, and glittering beetles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining flies, whose bodies glittered with a metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">luster, buzzed and flew above the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Huge butterflies once more were seen, dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the steaming, festering earth in an apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecstasy from the mere fact of existence, and all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand and one forms of insect life that flew and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled, and swam and dived, showed themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the tribesmen on the raft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Water-beetles came lazily to the surface, to snap</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sudden energy at mosquitoeB busily laying</seg><seg type="columnLine">896</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their eggs in the nearly stagnant water by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river-banks. Burl pointed out to Saya, with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitement, their silver breast-plates that shone as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they darted under the water again. And the shell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered boats of a thousand caddis-worms floated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eddies and back-waters of the stream. Water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boatmen and whirligigs--almost alone among in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects in not having shared in the general increase</seg><seg type="columnLine">of size--danced upon the oily waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day wore on as the shores flowed by. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribefolk ate of their burdens of mushroom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat, and drank from the fresh water of the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, when afternoon came, the character of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country about the stream changed. The banks fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and the current slackened. The shores be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came indefinite, and the river merged itself into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp, a vast swamp from which a continual mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering came which the tribesmen heard for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time before they saw the swamp itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The water seemed to turn dark, as black mud</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the place of the clay that had formed its bed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slowly, here and there, then more frequently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating green things that were stationary, and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not move with the current, appeared. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaves of water-lilies, that had remained with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant cabbages and a very few other plants in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the midst of a fungoid world. The green leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">were twelve feet across, and any one of them would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have floated the whole of Burl's tribe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently they grew numerous so that the channel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made narrow, and the mushroom rafts passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">between rows of the great leaves, with here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there a colossal, waxen blossom in which three men</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have hidden and which exhaled an almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">over-powering fragrance into the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the muttering that had been heard far away</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew in volume to an intermittent, incredibly deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">bass roar. It seemed to come from the banks on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side, and actually was the discordant croak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the giant frogs, grown to eight feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, which lived and loved in the huge swamp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">above which golden butterflies danced in ecstasy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which the transcendently beautiful blossoms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water-lilies filled with fragrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The swamp was a place of riotous life. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">green bodies of the colossal frogs--perchcd upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the banks in strange immobility and only opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">their huge mouths to emit their thunderous croak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings--the green bodies of the frogs blended queerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the vivid color of the water-lily leaves. Dragon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies fluttered in their swift and angular flight above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black and reeking mud. Greenbottles and blue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottles and a hundred other species of flies buzzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">busily in the misty air, now and then falling prey</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the licking tongues of the frogs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bees droned overhead in flight less preoccupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">and worried than elsewhere flitting from blossom to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blossom of the tremendous water-lilies, loading their</seg><seg type="columnLine">crops with honey and the bristles of their legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">with yellow pollen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everywhere over the mushroom-covered world</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air was never quite free from mist, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming exhalations of the pools, but here in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamps the atmosphere was so heavily laden with</seg><seg type="columnLine">moisture that the bodies of the tribefolk were</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with glistening droplets, while the wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat water-lily leaves glittered like platters of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jewels from the "steam" that had condensed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their upper surfaces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air was full of shining bodies and iridescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings. Myriads of tiny midges--no more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">three or four inches across their wings--danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the slow-flowing water. And butterflies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of every imaginable shade and color, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most delicate lavender to the most vivid carmine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced and fluttered, alighting upon the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-lilies to sip daintily of their nectar, skimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the water, enamored of their brightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinted reflections.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the pink-skinned tribesfolk, floating through</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fairyland on their mushroom rafts, gazed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide eyes at the beauty about them, and drew in</seg><seg type="columnLine">great breaths of the intoxicating fragrance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great white flowers that floated like elfin boats,upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Out of Bondage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE mist was heavy and thick, and through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying creatures darted upon their innum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erable businesses, visibly for an instant in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">their colorful beauty, then melting slowly into in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">definiteness as they sped away. The tribefolk on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clustered rafts watched them as they darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead, and for hours the little squadron of fun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">goid vessels floated slowly through the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">channel of the marsh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The river had split into innumerable currents</seg><seg type="columnLine">which meandered purposelessly through the glisten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing black mud of the swamp, but after a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">they seemed to reassemble, and Burl could see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had caused the vast morass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hills appeared on either side of the stream, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew higher and steeper, as if the foothills of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain chain. Then Burl turned and peered be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rising straight from the low hills, a wall of high</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains rose toward the sky, and the low-hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds met their rugged flanks but half-way toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peaks. To right and left the mountains melted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the tenuous haze, but ahead they were firm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalwart, rising and losing their heights in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud-banks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They formed a rampart which might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded the edge of the world, and the river flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more rapidly in a deeper and narrower</seg><seg type="columnLine">current toward a cleft between two rugged giants</seg><seg type="columnLine">that promised to swallow the water and all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might swim in its depths or float upon its surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tall, steep hills rose from either side of the swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">current, their sides covered with flaking molds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exotic shade of rose-pink, mingled here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">with lavender and purple. Rocks, not hidden be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath a coating of fungus, protruded their angular</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads from the hillsides. The river valley became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gorge, and then little more than a canon, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetling sides that frowned down upon the swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">current running beneath them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The small flotilla passed beneath an overhanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff, and then shot out to where the cliffsides drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart and formed a deep amphitheater, whose top</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hidden in the clouds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RED DUST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">897</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And across this open space, on cables all of five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet long, a banded spider had flung its</seg><seg type="columnLine">web. It was a monster of its tribe. Its belly was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen to a diameter of no less than two yards, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its outstretched legs would have touched eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">points of a ten-yard circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was hanging motionless in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal snare as the little group of tribefolk passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">underneath, and they saw the broad bands of yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and black and silver upon its abdomen. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivered as their little crafts were swept below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they eame to a little valley, where yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand bordered the river and there was a level space</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hundred yards on either side before the steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of the mountains began their rise. Here the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluster of mushroom rafts were caught in a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">eddy and drawn out of the swiftly flowing current.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon there was a soft and yielding jar. The rafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">had grounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Led by Burl, the tribesmen waded ashore, wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and excitement in their hearts. Burl searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about with his eyes. Toadstools and mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms, rusts and molds, even giant puff-balls grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the little valley, but of the deadly red mushrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw none.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A single bee was buzzing slowly over the tangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickets of fungoids, and the loud voice of a cricket</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in a deafening burst of sound, reechoed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hillsides, but save for the far-flung web of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banded spider a mile or more away, there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of the deadly creatures that preyed upon men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl began to climb the hillside with his tribe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk after him. For an hour they toiled upward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through confused masses of fungus of almost every</seg><seg type="columnLine">species. Twice they stopped to seize upon edible</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungi and break them into masses they could carry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once they paused and made a wide detour</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a thicket from which there came a stealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl believed that the rustling was merely the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of a moth or butterfly emerging from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">chrysalis, but was unwilling to take any chances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He and his people circled the mushroom thicket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mounted higher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And at last, perhaps six or seven hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the level of the river, they came upon a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau, going back into a small pocket in the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainside. Here they found many of the edible</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungoids, and no less than a dozen of the giant cab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bages, on whose broad leaves many furry grubs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were feeding steadily in placid contentment with</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves and all the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small stream bubbled up from a tiny basin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran swiftly across the plateau, and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense thickets of toadstools in which the tribesmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">might find secure hiding-places. The tribe would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make itself a new home here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night they hid among inextricably tangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of mushrooms, ant1- saw with amazement the</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude of creatures that ventured forth in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. All the valley and the plateau were il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumined by the shining beacons of huge but grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful fire-flies, who darted here and there in delight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--apparently--in security.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon the earth below, also, many tiny lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed. The larva of the fireflies crawled slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">but happily over the fungus-covered mountainside,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and great glow-worms clambered upon the shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">tops of the toadstools and rested there, twin broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">bands of bluish fire burning brightly within their</seg><seg type="columnLine">translucent bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were the females of the firefly race, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">never attain to legs and wings, but crawl always</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the earth, merely enlarged creatures in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of their own larva. Moths soared overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">with mighty, throbbing wing-beats, and all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world seemed a paradise through which no evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures roamed in search of prey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And a strange thing came to pass. Soon after</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness fell upon the earth and the steady drip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop of the rain began, a musical tinkling sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heard which grew in volume, and became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep-toned roar, which reechoed and reverberated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the opposite hillsides until it was like melodi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous and long-continued thunder. For a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people were puzzled and a little afraid, but Burl</seg><seg type="columnLine">took courage and investigated. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He emerged from the concealing thicket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered cautiously about, seeing nothing. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared move in the direction of the sound, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam from a dozen fireflies showed him a sheet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water pouring over a vertical cliff to the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">far below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rainfall, gentle as it was, when gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all the broad expanse of the mountainside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a river of its own, which had scoured out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed, and poured down each night to plunge in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smother of spray and foam through six hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of empty space to the swiftly flowing river</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center of the valley. It was this sound that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had puzzled the tribefolk, and this sound that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lulled them to sleep when Burl at last came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to allay their fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day they explored their new territory</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a boldness of which they would not have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable a month before. They found a single great</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap-door in the earth, sure sign of the burrow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a monster spider, and Burl resolved that before</seg><seg type="columnLine">many days the spider would be dealt with. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told his tribesmen so, and they nodded their heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly instead of shrinking back in terror as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have done not long since.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tribe was rapidly becoming a group of men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of taking the aggressive. They needed Burl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rash leadership, and for many generations they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would need bold leaders, but they were infinitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior to the timid, rabbit-like creatures they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. They bore spears, and they had used them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had seen danger, and had blindly followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burl through the forest of .strangled things instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fleeing weakly from the peril.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They wore soft, yellow fur about their middles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken from the bodies of giant slugs they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain. They had eaten much meat, and preferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">its succulent taste to the insipid savor of the mush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms that had once been their steady diet. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the exhilaration of brave adventure--though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been forced into adventure by Burl--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were far more worthy descendants of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancestors than those ancestors had known for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The exploration of their new domain yielded</seg><seg type="columnLine">many wonders and a few advantages. The tribe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folk found that the nearest ant-city was miles away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">898</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the small insects would trouble them but</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarely. (The nightly rush of water down the slop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sides of the mountain made it undesirable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the site of an ant colony.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And best of all, back in the little pocket in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainside, they found old and disused cells of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting wasps. The walls of the pocket were made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of soft sandstone with alternate layers of clay, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wasps had found digging easy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were a dozen or more burrows, the shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each some four feet in diameter and going back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cliff for nearly thirty feet, where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">branched out into a number of cells. Each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cells had once held a grub which had grown fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and large upon its hoard of paralyzed crickets, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then had broken away to the outer world to emerge</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a full-grown wasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, however, the laboriously tunneled caverns</seg><seg type="columnLine">would furnish a hiding-place for the tribe of men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a far more secure hiding-place than the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mushroom thickets. And, furthermore, a hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-place which, because more permanent, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually become a possession for which the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">would fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is a curious thing that the advancement of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">people from a state of savagery and continual war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fare to civilization and continual peace is not made</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the elimination of the causes of strife, but by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the addition of new objects and ideals, in defense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which that same people will offer battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A single chrysalis was found securely anchored</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the underside of a rock-shelf, and Burl detached</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with great labor and carried it into one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burrows, though the task was one that was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond his strength. He desired the butterfly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would emerge for his own use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He preempted, too, a solitary burrow a little dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant from the others, and made preparations for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">event that was destined to make his plans wiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more far-reaching than before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His followers were equally busy with their var-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious burrows, gathering stores of soft growth for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their couches, and later--at Burl's suggestion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">even carrying within the dark caverns the radiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads of the luminous mushrooms to furnish il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumination. The light would be dim, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mushroom had partly dried it would cease, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a people utterly ignorant of fire it was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a bad plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl was very happy for that time. His people</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked upon him as a savior, and obeyed his least</seg><seg type="columnLine">order without question. He was growing to repose</seg><seg type="columnLine">some measure of trust in them, too, as men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to have some glimmerings of the new-found</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage that had come to him, and which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">striven hard to implant in their breasts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tribe had been a formless gathering of</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. There were six or seven men and as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, and naturally families had come into being</seg><seg type="columnLine">--sometimes after fierce and absurd fights among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men--but the families were not the sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct agreements they would have been in a tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of higher development.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The marriage was but an agreement, terminable</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any time, and the men had but little of the feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of parenthood, though the women had all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierce maternal instinct of the insects abdut them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These burrows in which the tribefolk were mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their homes would put an end to the casual</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of the marriage bonds. They were homes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the making--damp and humid burrows without</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire or heat, but homes, nevertheless. The family</seg><seg type="columnLine">may come before the home, in the development of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind, but it invariably exists when the home</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tribe had been upon the plateau for nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week when Burl found that stirrings and smug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glings were going on within the huge cocoon he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had laid close beside the burrow he had chosen for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own. He cast aside all other work, and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently for the thing he knew was about to hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen. He squatted on his haunches beside the huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblong cylinder, his spear in his hand, waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently. From time to time he nibbled at a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of edible mushroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl had acquired many new traits, among which</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little foresight was most prominent, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never conquered the habit of feeling hungry at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every time that food was near at hand. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to wait. He had food. Therefore, he ate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of scrapings came from the closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocoon, caked upon its outer side with dirt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mold. The scraping and scratching continued, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently a tiny hole showed, which rapidly en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larged. Tiny jaws and a dry, glazed skin became</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible, the skin looking as if it had been varnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">with many coats of brown shellac. Then a mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed head forced its way through and stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All motion ceased for a matter of perhaps half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, and then the strange, blind head seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">become distended, to be swelling. A crack ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared along its upper part, which lengthened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew wide. And then a second head appeared from</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This head was soft and downy, and a slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">proboscis was coiled beneath its lower edge like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trunk of one of the elephants that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinct for many thousand years. Soft scales and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine hairs alternated to cover it, and two immense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many-faceted eyes gazed mildly at the world on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it was looking for the first time. The color</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the whole was purest milky-white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly and painfully, assisting itself by slender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">colorless legs that seemed strangely feeble and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling, a butterfly crawled from the cocoon. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings were folded and lifeless, without substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">or color, but the body was a perfect white. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">butterfly moved a little distance from its cocoon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly unfurled its wings.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribesmen sat about the white carcass, cracking</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the delicate limbs for the meat within them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Burl made sure that Saya secured the choicest</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits. The tribesmen were happy. Then one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">children of the tribe stretched a hand aloft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed up the mountainside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coming slowly down the slanting earth was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, narrow file of living animals. For a time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">file seemed to be but one creature, but Burl's keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes soon saw that there were many. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">caterpillars, each one perhaps ten feet long, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a tiny black head armed with sharp jaws, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with dull-red fur upon their backs. The rear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the procession was lost in the mist of the low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging cloud-banks that covered the mountainside</seg><seg type="columnLine">some two thousand feet above the plateau, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost was no more than three hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly and solemnly the procession came on, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black head of the second touching the rear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, and the head of the third touching the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the second. In faultless alinement, without in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervals, they moved steadily down the slanting side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mountain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Save the first, they seemed absorbed in maintain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their perfect formation, but the leader con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly rose upon his hinder half and waved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore part of his body in the air, first to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then to the left, as if searching out the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tribefolk watched in amazement mingled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror. Only Burl was calm. He had never seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slug that meant danger to man, and he reasoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these were at any rate moving slowly so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could be distanced by the fleeter-footed human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings, but he also meant to be cautious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slow march kept on. The rear of the proces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of caterpillars emerged from the cloud-bank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Burl saw that a shining white line was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them. No less than eighty great caterpillars</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad in white and dingy red were solemnly moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the mountainside, leaving a path of shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk behind them. Head to tail, in single .file, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no eyes or ears for anything but their proces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader reached the plateau, and turned. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the cluster of giant cabbages, and ignored</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He came to a thicket of mushrooms, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through it, followed by his devoted band.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he came to an open space where the earth was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft and sandy, where sandstone had weathered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a great heap of easily moved earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leading caterpillar halted, and began to bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row experimentally in the ground. The result</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased him, and some signal seemed to pass along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eight-hundred-foot line of creatures. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader began to dig with feet and jaws, working</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiously to cover himself completely with the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Those immediately behind him abandoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">their formation, and pressed forward in haste.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those still farther back moved more hurriedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All, when they reached the spot selected by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader, abandoned any attempt to keep to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, and hastened to find an unoccupied spot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open space in which to bury themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For perhaps half an hour the clearing was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of intense activity, incredible activity. Huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten-foot bodies burrowed desperately in the whitish</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, digging frantically to cover themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the half-hour, however, the last of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caterpillars had vanished. Only an occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement of the earth from the struggle of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried creature to bury itself still deeper, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">freshly turned surface showed that beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing on the plateau eighty great slugs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparing themselves, for the sleep of metamor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phosis. The piled-up earth and the broad, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of silk, leading back up the hillside until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">became lost in the clouds, alone remained to .tell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the visitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tribesmen had watched in amazement. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never seen these creatures before, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, of course, why they had entombed themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had they known what the scientists of thirty thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand years before had written in weighty and dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">books, they would have deduced from the appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of the processionary caterpillars--or pine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caterpillars--that somewhere above the banks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds there were growing trees and sunlight, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moon shone down, and stars twinkled from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue vault of a cloudless sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the tribesmen did not know. They only</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that there, beneath the soft earth, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty store of food for them when they cared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dig for it, that their provisions for many months</seg><seg type="columnLine">were secure, and that Burl, their leader, was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mighty man for having led them to this land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety and plenty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burl read their emotions in their eyes, but better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than their amazement and wonderment was a glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had nothing whatever to do with his leadership</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tribe. And then Burl rose, and took the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">snowy-white velvet cloaks from the wings of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white butterfly. One of them he flung about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own shoulders, and the other he flung about Saya.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then those two stood up before the wide-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribesmen, and Burl spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is my mate, and my food is her food, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wrath is my wrath.

But if, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">heating an object, we decrease the length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waves until they come within the limits of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision we see the heat waves as red. And by* still</seg><seg type="columnLine">further heating the object the hotter waves ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear to us as violet, white or yellow; white being,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you know, merely a mixture or combination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the various light waves. In other words, my dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, our eyes, our nerves, our ears, and in all prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability our noses as well, are much like radio re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiving sets. We can 'tune in' waves of light, sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat and scent within certain limits, and, like radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiving sets, we often fail to 'tune out' interfer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences. Many sounds are far too high or too low</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the human ear to detect, just as many light</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves are too short or too long for us to see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All extremely interesting and educational." I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "But what bearing does all this have on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter under discussion--the rendering of various</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects--any object I believe you said,--invisible?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let me reply by asking you a question," smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend. "Why are objects--human beings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses, trees, anything we see,--visible? Merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they reflect light," he continued without</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for my answer. "Very well, then. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">see an object because it reflects light; we see</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors on that object because it has properties which</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it to absorb certain light rays and to reflect</seg><seg type="columnLine">others--if red to us, it absorbs the violet, indigo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue, green, yellow and orange rays. If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">appears white it reflects all the rays. If black, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbs them. In other words we do not actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the object at all. We merely see the light waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected from the object. And if means can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found to cause the object to absorb the light rays--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'd have a black object instead of a colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">one," I laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," agreed my friend quite unperturbed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Provided the absorption was imperfect," he added.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But," he continued, "if the means were such as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause perfect absorption, in other words to allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light waves to pass through the object, then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would become invisible, just as clear glass is in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible, even though glass reflects certain waves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light which cannot be detected by the human eye."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I chuckled. The idea of transforming opaque ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects to transparent objects seemed highly amusing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go to it," I laughed, "Why not begin with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladies? Their clothes are pretty nearly trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you're trying to be facetious there's no use</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO COULD VANISH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">903</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in my attempting to explain my ideas and theories,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">commented Dr. Unsinn in an injured tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wasn't laughing at your theories," I assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "And I'm really interested, even if I don't see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you're getting at."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If your sense of logic and your knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science were as highly developed as your sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor and your knowledge of women's garments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you might more readily grasp what I am 'getting at'</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you put it," he said dryly. "However," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, "I had no intention of conveying the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I believed visible objects could be rendered</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible by such means. But if, by altering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequency or lengths of light waves reflected from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an object, we could render such waves too short</seg><seg type="columnLine">or too long for the human eye to register, then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object would become wholly invisible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time I was really interested. My friend's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arguments were, I knew, sound. If the frequency</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one form of vibratory wave could be altered; if</seg><seg type="columnLine">an oscillating wave could be changed to a direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave or vice versa, if the inaudible radio waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be made audible by the simplest of instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, was there any scientific reason why light</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves ordinarily visible might not be made in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the man who succeeds in accomplishing such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feat will control the world," declared Dr. Unsinn</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupting my thoughts.

He could amass mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions, billions if he wished. He could control the</seg><seg type="columnLine">destinies of nations! No treaties, no plots, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">business deals could be secret. He could go any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, unknown, unsuspected, unseen.

And, amid</seg><seg type="columnLine">new scenes and new friends, and with matters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">much -more pressing importance to occupy my at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention, all thoughts of Dr. Unsinn's weird ideas</seg><seg type="columnLine">were completely driven from my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not until several months later, when I was home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jvard bound, did I again think of our last con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">versation. I had, to be sure, dropped him a post-</seg><seg type="columnLine">card now and then, but I had received no reply and</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not expect any. Lemuel was never one to write,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he considered it a waste of time to carry on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposeless correspondence with anyone, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would fill page after page with facts, figures and</seg><seg type="columnLine">theories in letters to other scientists. Now, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, as I recalled our conversation, I found myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering if he had actually attempted to carry his</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory to a test. Of course the idea was ridiculously</seg><seg type="columnLine">bizarre and unattainable and yet, I felt sure that Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unsinn had actually been in earnest and really be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved that it Was scientifically possible to produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisibility in solid matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the more I mentally reviewed his words and</seg><seg type="columnLine">analyzed his statements, the more I felt that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be right, at least theoretically. After all, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a feat any more remarkable than the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ship's wireless operator was talking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening to people thousands of miles distant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated from our ship by countless leagues of sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and land? And yet the idea of any material object</seg><seg type="columnLine">being invisible seemed so far-fetched and super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural that I could not bring myself to 'believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lemuel would ever attempt to experiment along</seg><seg type="columnLine">such lines. Nevertheless, I had thought so much on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject that, at the first opportunity after my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival, and reaching my apartment, I called Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unsinn, by phone and, after the usual greetings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked how he was succeeding in his black art. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps he felt slightly piqued at my tone or my words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but instantly there was a change in his voice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he replied, rather shortly, that it was evident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had not improved in my attitude towards science,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that, as an old chum and friend, he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to have me call whenever I found it convenient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just why my curiosity had been aroused I can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not say, but curious I was nevertheless and within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hour I was at Lemuel's door. His Filipino ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vant Miguel, answered the bell and greeted me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a welcoming grin on his usually emotionless face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Senor Doctor is in the laboratory," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced as I entered. "He Bay you will please to</seg><seg type="columnLine">await him in the library. He will arrive in one little</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was somewhat surprised for, as a rule, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome to enter Lemuel's holy of holies whenever</seg><seg type="columnLine">I called, and never before had I been asked to await</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pleasure like a perfect stranger. But no doubt I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, he was busy on some delicate experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did not wish to be interrupted. Entering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">library I turned to a table littered with magazines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and scientific reports and rather idly glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">through them. A sound, like the creaking of a foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">step on a loose board caused me to turn, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door was open, the hallway was in plain view and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one was in sight. Once more I resumed my per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usal of the periodicals and was becoming a bit in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested in an article I ran across, when I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled by a low chuckle. Instantly I wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, surprised that I had not heard my friend's</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach, only to find the room empty. Then, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, rather foolishly gaping I fear, and puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand how my ears had deceived me, I fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly jumped. Out of the obviously empty room came</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Unsinn's unmistakable voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">904</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry to have kept you waiting," it said, "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking exceedingly well after your trip."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant a strange creepy sensation swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">over me. Then I realized that this must be one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend's practical jokes. No doubt he had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalled some sort of telephone or loud speaker ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangement in the apartment and was testing it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As nearly as I could judge, the words had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the farther corner of the room where there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a large, deeply-upholstered chair. Taking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">step nearer, I peered into the corner, trying to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover the hidden instrument. And as I gazed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair I rubbed my eyes and wondered if I were tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing leave of my senses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slightly above the back of the chair and sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended in mid-air were a pair of spectacles. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left side and a short distance below was a round</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal disc and also seemingly floating in the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere, were a number of buttons, a gold watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chain, two small ornamental silver buckles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Borne cuff links and a large signet ring. Just below</seg><seg type="columnLine">these and suspended a few inches above the chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat were several silver coins, while just above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor four rows of small metal rings hung without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any support whatsoever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even while I gazed, dumbfounded, utterly at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss to account for this strange hallucination, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghostly chuckle again issued from the corner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw the various objects sway, the coins shift their</seg><seg type="columnLine">position and the ring move towards the spectacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed to follow it, as though drawn by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnet, as it again descended to its former position.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, once again, the uncanny voice spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear boy, your expression is most remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able," it said. "You really should see yourself. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is most gratifying to me for it proves my test is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a success. If I remember correctly, you remarked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I last saw you, that you hoped the next time</seg><seg type="columnLine">you saw me you would not see me at all. Well, your</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish is granted, you are gazing--or rather I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, gaping, at me without seeing me. But I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wonder you are amazed and also incredulous--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't deny it, I can see you think this some hoax.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had been gazing, gaping; jaw dropped, mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, eyes fairly popping, as the voice spoke, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinated, I saw the watch, the discs and the money</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly rise upward and come towards me. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant I fairly shrieked and leaped back. An un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen ghostly hand had gripped my shoulder! A</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearty peal of laughter rang through the apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">as, shaken, almost terror stricken, I shrank back</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the old-fashioned mantel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, my experiment is a complete success," an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced the disembodied voice, "but there is no need</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry the test further. You see my 'black art' as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you call it has worked, and the impossible has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made possible. But I feel you will be more at ease</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I am visible. No doubt it will take time to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom yourself to the phenomenon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly had the last word been issued when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch, the discs and the coins vanished, and Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unsinn stood before me, as solid, as substantial</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as natural as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I collapsed. It was almost as great a shock to my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves to see my friend materialize from the air as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had been to hear his voice, to feel his grip when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been invisible, yes, invisible, for no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">could I doubt that the scientist had succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the impossible possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I have answered your query of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning," exclaimed Dr. Unsinn triumphantly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seated himself in his favorite chair. "I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite sure of my.success even before you arrived,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued. "I could not be sure, however, for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely enough,--and quite surprising and as yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat inexplicable to me, I can see myself in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror even when invisible to others. But I tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to a slight extent on Miguel, although I dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not put the fellow to a thorough test,--too super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitious and excitable you know. Might have died</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fright or have bolted, if I had spoken, or if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had noticed anything such as my watch or buttons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah, you noticed such objects did you not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time I had regained a bit of my compos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure and enough breath to speak. "I'll say I did," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied. "But why allow such objects to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hmm, that is my great difficulty," replied Lem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uel regretfully. "It is obvious that the same treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment will not serve for all objects. I have learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to render any organic substance invisible, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as yet, I have not discovered how to accomplish the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result with inorganic matter. My body, my cloth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, my shoes, yes, even objects of wood are, by my</seg><seg type="columnLine">method, easily rendered invisible, but metals--my</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch, my suspender buttons, the coins in my pock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">et and the eyelets for my shoe strings resist, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far, all my efforts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how," I interrupted, "do you do it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Unsinn smiled knowingly. "That is a secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do not care to divulge," he replied. "But," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, "in a general way it is along the lines I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested during our last conversation on the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject,--by altering the frequency of light waves so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they become invisible to the human eye. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, my friend, are deplorably ignorant of higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">physics, I may perhaps better explain the process</seg><seg type="columnLine">by comparing it with certain phenomena of radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which you may be more or less familiar. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know the meaning of the term 'heterodyne?'"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good," continued Lemuel. "Then I can state</seg><seg type="columnLine">that by my process I send out certain vibratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves from my apparatus, and these, striking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light rays, reflect them back with a frequency</seg><seg type="columnLine">which renders them invisible. In other words, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light rays which would, normally, strike a solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">object, and, being reflected therefrom, would cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">that object to become visible, are prevented from</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking that object by my method, but strike an</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor of an envelope of outgoing vibratory waves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is that clear?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perfectly," I lied blithely, not in the least un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstanding the scientific side of the explanation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but deeply interested nevertheless. "But," I asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't understand why some objects remain vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible while others vanish, and I didn't notice any ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus for bringing on your astounding invisi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not myself fully understand why organic</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO COULD VANISH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.905</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">oDjects should respond to my treatment and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">organic objects should resist it," admitted my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. "But it is probably due to the fact that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">organic materials do not throw off my vibratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves at the same frequency as organic materials.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I will solve the problem; I must solve it! As</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your other query, the appliance which I em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploy is very compact and becomes invisible together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with myself. At first the apparatus was cumber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some and clumsy, but I have now perfected it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it so readily and perfectly under control that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is even more simple than tuning-in on a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio receiving set. Indeed, the results may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought about slowly and gradually, as I will de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Dr. Unsinn stood before me a strange, incred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ibly weird change came over him. A thin haze</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to envelop his body, and as I stared fascin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated, the haze seemed slowly to clear away and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my indescribable amazement I saw the curtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway leading into the room whose portiere and</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of whose frame appeared through my friend's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body and' head. If ever there was a ghost Lemuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one. And then, as if snuffed out, Lemuel com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely vanished and only his spectacles, the fra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ternity button on his lapel, his watch and chain, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuff-links, his belt and arm-garter buckles, his ring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch and chain and the other metallic objects of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his apparel remained to assure my reeling senses</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Dr. Unsinn still stood before me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I cannot begin to describe the sensation of thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing my companion vanish before my eyes, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing compared to the creepy, uncanny</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve-racking sensation which followed, as Lemuel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">characteristic chuckle issued from the transparent*</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and he again spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For Heaven's sake!"

But even if I did I fail to see how</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would render your disappearance any less un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canny."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is my belief," replied Dr. Unsinn, "that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were treated by my waves I would still be vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible to you and you to me. I am, as I informed you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite visible to myself when I look in a mirror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This I assume is due to some effect which my ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus exercises upon the optic nerves, thus en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abling the eye to register the light-waves even</seg><seg type="columnLine">when their frequency is accelerated. I am most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to test the matter and you will confer a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great favor by acceding to my wishes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bit of it," I declared. "You can monkey</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such things all you wish, but I'm perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied to remain visible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lemuel shook his head sadly. "You're a conserv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ative imbecile," he informed me. "I had counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your accompanying me, as I go about, in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to note the effect upon the public, and it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">most desirable that you should also be invisible."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Look here," I said. "I know you can vanish; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it's all a perfectly natural feat, but it's too</seg><seg type="columnLine">devilishly creepy and uncanny for my nerves. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you're going to keep on being snuffed out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking from an invisible mouth I'll leave you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own devices and not come near your place."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Unsinn grinned. 'You forget that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't prevent me from coming to see you." he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded me. "I could enter your apartment un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen and unsuspected. I might be seated on one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your chairs or lying on a couch in the same room</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you and you'd never suspect it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I didn't see your confounded watch and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic articles," I assented. "But with all your</seg><seg type="columnLine">darned scientific ardor I know you're not one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt-in where you're not wanted,--even for the sake</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an experiment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But all joking aside," said my friend, "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry that your nerves should be upset by my de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstration. However, there is, I think, a means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcoming all your objections and yet helping me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my most valuable and interesting experiments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have, in fact, devised a little instrument which</seg><seg type="columnLine">will enable you to see me even when I am invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to others."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rising, he opened a cabinet, and turning, handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a small rectangular box slightly larger than r</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarette case. To one end of the box a fine braidec</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord was attached with the other end terminating</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a pair of metal-rimmed, slightly tinted, eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you will place the detector case in your pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and adjust the glasses on your nose, we will try an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting test," announced Dr. Unsinn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here," I said. "Is this some darned trick to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make me invisible?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I assure you it is not," he declared. "But if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am not vastly mistaken it will prevent me from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming invisible to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somewhat hesitatingly, and without the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith in the apparently simple device, I slipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case in my breast pocket and placed the glasses on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my nose. As far as I could see all objects remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same as before, though everything, including</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lemuel's face, took on a peculiar pinkish tint, due,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I supposed, to the color of the glasses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I presume you have no difficulty in seeing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various objects about the room, including myself,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said my friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a bit," I assured him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, if you will kindly press the lever on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case we will proceed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Examining the case, I noticed a small lever or</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm which fitted snuggly into a small groove on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the affair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">906</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lift, the lever and move it forward--toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord, as far as it will go," said my friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slight click followed by an almost inaudible</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling sound issued from the case as I obeyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his instructions. But, as far as I could see, theoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no other results. Lemuel still sat in his chair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs crossed, his elbows on the chair-arms, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tips of his fingers together, and his mild blue eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking over the tops of his glasses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The confounded contraption's a dud," I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, "everything's just the same."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Precisely," my friend agreed. "But just re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">move the glasses from your eyes for a moment."</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I complied with his request I uttered a cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter amazement. Dr. Unsinn was absolutely in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now replace the glasses," said his disembodied</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly knowing what to expect, absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumbfounded, I again placed the glasses before my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and there sat my friend as before. I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe it. I could not believe that this "now you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him and now you don't" effect was produced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glasses. No, I felt sure, it was a trick on Lem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uel's part. He must manage to vanish and to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear coincidently with my donning or removing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lenses. But he assured me,--quite heatedly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">convincingly,--that he had remained in the invis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible state throughout the experiment, and, more-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, he was so evidently highly elated at the suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess of his invention that at last I was forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that the magic glasses actually rendered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible visible. But my brain was now in a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete chaos. My friend's power to render himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible, the fact that certain objects remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible, the effect of the glasses rendering him vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible to me while still invisible to ordinary eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all unquestionable facts; but they were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird, uncanny and downright supernatural, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt as if in a confused, preposterous dream, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I half expected to wake up at any moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's splendid," exclaimed Lemuel, interrupting</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chaotic thoughts. "Even if I cannot overcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">your absurd and unreasonable objections to becom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing invisible it now matters little."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here!" I ejaculated. "Just what are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">planning to do? Are you going out to amass the</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions you spoke of, to control the world? I'll ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit there's no reason why you should not succeed,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessing your secret, nothing is impossible of at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainment, but if you plan taking me along you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken. I'm not invisible and I don't intend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, and I can easily foresee where I'd be the goat</seg><seg type="columnLine">for any confounded ghostly acts you perpetrated."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Unsinn laughed heartily. "My dear boy!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried, controlling his merriment. "You appear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget that I am a scientist and a respected member</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the community with a reputation to uphold. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not the least desire nor intention to overstep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bounds of honesty, law, or proper behavior, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if invisible. If I were so minded I could, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, help myself to the world's treasures, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">control the destinies of nations, could in fact place</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself beyond the power of man or the law. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">my sole idea is to use my discovery for the benefit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mankind, to perfect it and give it to the world, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">so many great discoveries have been given. We men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of science are never materialists.--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're an idiot!" I exclaimed. "Benefit of man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind ! Give it to the world! Why, if you gave your</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery to the world,--if you gave the secret to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone,--it would be a curse to mankind; you'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroying law and order and the world!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hmm, perhaps there is something in that," ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted Lemuel regretfully. "But at any rate, I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover how to treat inorganic substances before</seg><seg type="columnLine">any very extensive experiments can be conducted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would hardly do for a crowd to see a watch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buttons wandering about without visible attach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment or reason."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You might leave your watch behind, and use</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone or fibre buttons," I suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, my dear man," objected my friend, "unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can render all substances invisible I shall feel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my efforts have been in vain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I sincerely hope you fail," I informed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't see what good it will do for the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and if it leaks out, Heaven help us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"JusiTwhat thousands of conservative hide-bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons have said of every great discovery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past," exclaimed Lemuel, as I rose to take my leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Unsinn Perfects His Invention</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS I walked towards my apartment, my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, of course, filled with thoughts of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend's amazing discovery. And, among</seg><seg type="columnLine">other matters, it came to me, as a rather curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and amusing fact, that Dr. Unsinn, who had dwelt</seg><seg type="columnLine">so enthusiastically upon the material possibilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of invisibility, when he first discussed the matter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now far more interested in proving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific theories than in profiting by his discovery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was typical of the man, and is, I believe, of most</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists. But a more disturbing thought was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend was deplorably absent-minded,--a common</seg><seg type="columnLine">trait of scientists also, especially when preoccupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with some experiment, and, being so inherently</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest and frank himself, he was too prone to as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sume that his fellow-beings were the same. In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay, so I feared, a very grave danger. I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered occasions in the past when, suddenly side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracked by some new lead, he had completely for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten formulae or calculations which had enabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to succeed in some experiment, and had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to duplicate the results. Might he not, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavoring to perfect some feature of his own dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery, forget some important detail and find him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self unable to restore himself to visible form? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in fact this chance that had caused me to refuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to test his device upon myself. I could see where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be most entertaining and advantageous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">become invisible temporarily, but I had no desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain in that condition indefinitely, and any</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure of Lemuel's device, any miscalculation, any</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident or any sudden illness on his part might</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave me forever incapable of resuming my visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. The risk to be sure might be small, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far too great for me to take. And finally, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the chance that Dr. Unsinn might, in his ardor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enthusiasm, divulge his secret. Unquestion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO COULD VANISH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">907</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ably he would wish to announce his discovery to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow scientists; if he did so some one would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact public and then, as I had said to Lemuel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heaven help mankind. My head swam and I fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled at thought of what would occur should my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend's secret fall into the hands of unprincipled</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Law, society, governments would be power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. Possessing the power to become invisible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooks could defy the world. They could loot banks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">state treasuries, mints and all other sources of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarded millions, unseen, unhampered and leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">no traces of their identity. Murder, robbery, rapine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">any and all crimes could be committed without fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of detection or punishment. Even if caught una-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wares and thrown into prison an invisible man could</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk out without being seen. No walls could hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, no court try him, no punishment be dealt him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And even if the secret were known to all, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make little difference, unless, as Lemuel had seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think, a person invisible himself could see others</seg><seg type="columnLine">when under the effect of the apparatus. The next in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant I laughed out so loudly that passers-by turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared at me. What a fool I had been! How</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridiculous my worry over any such possibility! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had forgotten about the marvelous glasses! My</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend's secret might become public property and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet be harmless, even in the hands of the most des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate criminals. Just as there is an antidote for</seg><seg type="columnLine">every poison, so Lemuel's magic glasses would safe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard the world from any evil that might result</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his discovery. Moreover, there was always the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance that he would be unable to discover a means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rendering inorganic matter invisible, and if so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his invention would be of little value either to hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est or dishonest men. At thought of the weird situ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ations that might result, I chuckled. I could imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine a gunman, himself invisible, holding up some</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizen, and I could visualize the amazed expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the victim as he saw a revolver suspended in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid-air and pointing at him, and heard a disem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied voice ordering him to throw up his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it was amusing to picture motor cars, appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently empty, threading their way through traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stopping and starting at the signals of a visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle blown by an invisible traffic officer. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's imagination could run riot and nothing imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ined could equal the reality if my friend's, invention</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into general use. And, no doubt, I had greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">overestimated the dangers and the undesirable fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of the discovery. In all probability the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention, once it became known, would create little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more excitement or wonder than had followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention of the telephone, the radio or any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">epochal thing. People would take it as a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course and no greater harm would come of it than</seg><seg type="columnLine">had resulted from the discovery of the steam en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine, electricity, or any other revolutionary inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, all of which had been looked upon as inimical</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world and to mankind when they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">first announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate, I could not afford to worry over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lemuel's affairs even if his marvelous achievement</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually occupied my thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several days I heard nothing from Dr. Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinn, and I was far too busy with my own work to</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit him. No doubt he was deep in his experiments</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and I felt sure he would notify me when he had per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected anything new. And in this I wa3 not mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken. Answering my telephone, I wa3 greeted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lemuel's voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got it!" he cried. "I've conquered inorganic</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. Everything is perfected! Can you come</seg><seg type="columnLine">over at once?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As on my previous visit, Miguel admitted me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as before, he requested me to wait for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend in the library. But this time I was prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had no intention of being either frightened or</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed at anything Dr. Unsinn might spring on</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. At least, I thought I was; but I had un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derestimated my friend's abilities and the astound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing possibilities of his perfected discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing before the old-fashioned fireplace, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening intently for the slightest sound which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might betray the approach of an invisible being,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I peered about the room half expecting to see Lem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uel materialize or to hear his bodiless voice speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I did so a thin fog or mist seemed to cloud my</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision. I can best describe the sensation as similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a "blind headache" from which I had at times</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered. I could distinguish every object in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">library, but everything appeared to be slightly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of focus. I rubbed my eyes and stared again. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall opposite where I stood a luminous spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared; other bright spots seemed to take form</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ceiling and the floor and on the other walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without doubt, I thought, I was in for a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">headache, for such bright, luminous spots always</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared before my eyes when such an attack was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming on. And then a strange, a marvelous, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely astounding and terrifying change took</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Floor, ceiling, walls; every object within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room melted away.. It was exactly the effect that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen when a film or a lantern-slide is melted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heat of the projection machine. One instant I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was standing before the fireplace in Dr. Unsinn's</seg><seg type="columnLine">library; the next instant I was in the centre of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank, standing in a void. To the right, where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall and two windows had been, was the broad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree-shaded street with its electric lights and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy houses on the further side. Above</seg><seg type="columnLine">me was space; below me intense, fathomless</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness. And yet, my feet rested on solid matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as, too amazed and terrified even to cry out, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt gropingly with my outstretched hands, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers touched the mantel and a nearby table with</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazines that rustled at my touch. And then, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly, I knew what had occurred. Incredible, ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terly unbelievable as it seemed, I knew that Lemuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his uncanny, his almost supernatural invention</seg><seg type="columnLine">had amused himself and had demonstrated his</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers by rendering the entire apartment invis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My fright gave way to absolute wonder. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible but true, and feeling confident that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was right, I rather hesitatingly took a step forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never shall I forget the sensation. Surrounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothingness, as far as my vision went, suspended</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mid-air, yet I was walking as securely, as firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on as solid a floor as ever. Reassured, I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the street that stretched before me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">far beneath me. As if in a dream I walked for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">908</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ward with arms extended, and, the next moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">banged with uncomfortable force against a solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. And at my involuntary expletive, Lemuel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearty laughter came from behind me, and I stag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered back as an invisible hand slapped my shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It works!" exclaimed the voice. "It's the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful discovery ever made by man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the most damnable way to wreck a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves," I blurted out, as my hands came into con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact with an invisible chair and I dropped weakly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry I had to frighten you a bit," said my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend's voice. "But I wanted to test the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you want to keep my friendship, you'll turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">off your confounded machine and get things back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to normal," I replied testily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, all right," agreed Lemuel, "but look here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man, can't you wait a minute? I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm looking here, there and everywhere," I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed.

"The world will</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome it and will acclaim me the greatest inven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor and greatest benefactor of the human race."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"See here," I cried, all my old fears again pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessing me, "Won't you listen to reason and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon sense? You're so carried away with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">success that you haven't stopped to think what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would mean, if you 1st the world know of your in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention. No, don't interrupt me, I've worried over</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ever since I was here last, and I'm going to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have it out with you here and now. I'll admit you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded better than I expected or hoped, for if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you had failed to make inorganic substances in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible your invention might not have been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous. As it is, the possibilities for destroying</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, property, society and mankind are too tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous to even think of. Can't you see what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would mean if crooks got hold of it? Can't you see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it would mean if it fell into the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bolshevists, or revolutionists or governments? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, you'd upset the world, destroy civilization,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreak unspeakable woe and misery and terror."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Piffle!" ejaculated Lemuel, "if everything and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody was invisible the status of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">would remain unchanged. How could a criminal</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack an invisible victim? Instead of facilitating</seg><seg type="columnLine">crime it would deter crime. Instead of bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on wars and destruction it would prevent such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. How could an army fight an invisible foe?</seg><seg type="columnLine">How could a navy attack invisible ships? And in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible police and officers of law and order could</seg><seg type="columnLine">apprehend criminals much more readily.

Is it likely that they would let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world know of the glasses which counteract the</seg><seg type="columnLine">process? No, every moment that you possess the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus for working your devilish trick, you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening your fellow men and civilization with</seg><seg type="columnLine">annihilation.

I shall not,--for the present at least,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I know you will not. Moreover, even if it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, no one could work it.

I am free to grant that certain things</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have said are not without foundation. I had,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the beginning, expected to make my invention</seg><seg type="columnLine">public, for of course it is impossible to patent it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyone could pirate the patent, and, availing him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self of his knowledge could render himself invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus beyond reach of the law. But I may decide</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to give my discovery to the world at large. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">all depends upon future experiments and tests. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you really feel as you say in regard to it, you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">help me to carry out my tests. If, in my judgment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in yours, these experiments prove the invention</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually a peril to society then, I assure you, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">never be revealed to the public.

"But before I agree I want to know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">these experiments are which you have in mind."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Certainly," said Lemuel. "I intend to go about</seg><seg type="columnLine">while invisible, accompanied by you equipped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glasses, and from personal observation deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine just what will or might 'happen, and whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power to become invisible would be beneficial or</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see anything to object to in that," I as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured him, "and I'll agree to help you, provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">you agree not to do anything which might result</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my being held responsible. Remember, I will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible and you. will not, and I'd hardly care to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand up in a police court and claim that an invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion was responsible for certain acts of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was accused. No, Lemuel, I have no desire to end</seg><seg type="columnLine">my days in an insane asylum."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, my dear boy," chuckled my friend, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a splendid test, and of course I could al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways materialize at the last moment.

"I have no intention of overstepping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounds of the law, and I shall certainly so conduct</seg><seg type="columnLine">my experiments that no blame can be attached to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. But," he added regretfully, "it would be much</seg><seg type="columnLine">better if you also would submit to the effect of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">device."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I won't and that's an end to that," I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared positively.

You'll have to promise me that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not try the experiment of making things in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible by wholesale,--no vanishing of rooms, build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings or other structures while occupied. A terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic might and most certainly would result. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">this includes trolley cars, railway trains, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicles and similar things. A panic is the easiest</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the world to start and the hardest to stop."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I promise," assented my friend, "but I shall most</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuredly try my invention on unoccupied struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures and other objects."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't care what you try it on provided you do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not endanger life or property," I told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then we'll start our experiment tomorrow," ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed Lemuel. "We'll start from your apartment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If convenient to you I'll call at ten tomorrow morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Unsinn's Experiment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I DO not know exactly what object Dr. Unsinn</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in view, or what he hoped to accomplish by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his "experiment." Certainly he had demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strated his discovery and had proved it successful</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his tests on myself. Possibly he felt that human</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight might vary, that some persons might find him</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible while to others he was visible, or again, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have wished merely to gratify his own vanity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enjoy the sensation of moving unseen among</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellows. He could not, in fact, clearly explain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to me what he expected or why he was so insistent</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon having me accompany him, when, as we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed, we set out from my apartment. But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the events which followed I feel sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was fate or predestination that led him to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take his experiment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wearing the marvelous glasses, in order that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might not lose sight of my companion, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered himself invisible, I hailed an approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolley car. But habit is a strong and persistent</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, and the human mind is greatly governed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impressions it receives through the eyes, aUd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the very outset of our venture I learned this to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chagrin. Boarding the car with Lemuel at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels, I handed the conductor a dime and he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned a nickel in change. I was on the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">handing it back, and the word "two" was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip of my tongue when a nudge from Lemuel's el-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow brought me to my senses. As my friend was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly visible to me I had completely forgotten that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was invisible to the conductor, and I mentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">wowed to watch my step more closely in the future.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were few passengers in the car and my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion seated himself in one corner while I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seat beside him. And presently habit once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again came to the fore and came near to getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">me into a most embarrassing situation. Quite for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting, momentarily, that my friend was invisible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I spoke to him, and he, quite in his ordinary man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, replied. In fact we were carrying on quite an</seg><seg type="columnLine">animated conversation when I was suddenly brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a realization of what we were doing by the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">havior of the other passengers. Everyone was gaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at me. Some curiously, others half pityingly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if thinking me either mad or intoxicated, while still</seg><seg type="columnLine">others were grinning and thoroughly enjoying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacle of a man carrying on a conversation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Even the conductor had entered the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was staring at me, a strangely puzzled expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion on his face, as if undecided whether I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous lunatic or a common drunk. Fortunately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my presence of mind came to my rescue, and, flush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but forcing a smile, I turned to an intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearing gentleman near me. "I must apologize for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my absent-mindedness," I stammered. "I was merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">practising a bit of ventriloquism for my act, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inadvertently spoke aloud."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This lame explanation appeared to satisfy every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. The passengers resumed their former occupa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of staring vacantly out of the windows, read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their papers, or gazing absently at the advertis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing placards within the car, while the conductor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently relieved, betook himself again to the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now, however, the experiment was getting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my nerves. I had feared that my friend's absent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mindedness might lead him into trouble and yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by my own thoughtless actions, I had twice within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments barely escaped getting into deep water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the fact that I could not speak my mind to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible companion, and that I had pledged myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the experiment through, only added to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritation. As, inwardly fuming, I resolved to' keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind constantly alert to avoid further em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassment, the car came to a stop and a stout,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pompous and overdressed middle-aged woman en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">910</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. As the car started with a jerk she lurched</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, and, before I realized her intention,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she plumped herself into the apparently vacant seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me. A grunt from my invisible friend, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific shriek from the stout female instantly fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed, and, as if bounced from a spring, she sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, her eyes blazing, her face white with indigna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and fairly shouting a torrent of abuse as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook her beringed fist in my face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Brute! Disreputable old rake!" she screamed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll have you jailed! I'll have you imprisoned!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly the car was in an uproar. Passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded forward; necks were craned; everyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked at once, and the conductor pushed his burly</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure between the irate female and myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hey, what's the game?" he demanded. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">did this guy do to yer, lady?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He obtruded himself beneath me,--the unspeak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able fiend!" she shrieked. "He endeavored to em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brace me and pinched me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did nothing of the sort," I declared, fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting to make myself heard. "I--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell it to the judge," interrupted the conductor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping towards me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately for me the gentleman to whom I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered my ventriloquistic explanation, now inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vened in my behalf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The lady is mistaken," he declared, rising and</seg><seg type="columnLine">restraining the conductor. "I was observing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this gentleman closely. She seated herself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vacant seat and this gentleman did not move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Possibly--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah, the old guy's right," chimed in a greasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanic opposite. "He never done nothin'. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dame's nutty. What guy'd want her to squat in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lap?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly the woman's wrath was turned on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">new victim, but before violence could be done the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conductor intervened. "Hey, quit this roughhouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff," he ordered. "If youse want to fight take it</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside. Guess you're in wrong, lady. Sit down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or get 'off and call a cop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still glaring, and voicing her opinions of every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, and especially of me, she again descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponderously to Lemuel's seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An involuntary exclamation escaped my lips, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was uncalled for. During the excitement, Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unsinn had risen and had slipped unseen to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear platform where he was beckoning to me wild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only too glad to escape, I rose and joined him and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the car came to a halt, we stepped off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound the woman!" he exclaimed the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were alone. "She very nearly fractured my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thighs. You would have gotten us into a nice fix</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she had. How could a doctor set an invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone? And the apparatus in my pocket might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been ruined so that I could not have regained my</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible form. You'll have to be more careful in</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. Why didn't you stop her or warn me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">For an instant I was too amazed at his outburst</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak. So he, too, was blaming me for all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. This was too much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here!" I cried, "I've had enough of this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're as well able to take care of yourself while</seg><seg type="columnLine">divisible as when visible. If you're going to de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pend on me to keep you out of trouble I'll quit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you can go ahead with your damnable experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment alone. And you talk about getting into</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble! You're safe and I'm the goat every time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Think it's fun for me to be called names and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened with arrest? I'd look nice trying to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain matters to the police or the judge, wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lemuel chuckled. "Come, come," he exclaimed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing his hand on my arm. "I didn't mean to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you take it that way, Old Man. But we'll both</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to be a trifle more circumspect in future. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">really, it was most amusing. Now I propose tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a taxi hereafter. I am convinced that trolley</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars are not suitable conveyances for me in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducting my tests. But the test was most conclusive</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now the humor of the incident had outweighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more serious side of the affair in my mind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I laughed heartily with Lemuel as we waited on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner for an empty taxi to approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within the vehicle we could converse freely, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise of the motor and the surrounding traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevented the driver from hearing our voices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lemuel, elated at the success of his experiments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now becoming reckless and suggested that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be most interesting and amusing to render</seg><seg type="columnLine">the taxi and ourselves invisible. But I sternly for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bade it. "You're an idiot." I declared, "we could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">maimed or killed even if we were invisible. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you realize we'd be in a wreck within ten seconds?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you make any more such crazy suggestions I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that you're placed in a lunatic asylum."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easier said than done," he reminded me, "but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all joking aside, I must try the effect on something</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than myself. Ah, I have it! Stop the cab,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he had been speaking we had passed a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">office building in course of erection, and, as I paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the taxi driver, Lemuel was gazing appraisingly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the towering structure of steel and stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A splendid opportunity!" he ccied enthusiastic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally. "Possibly my pocket apparatus may not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient power but--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound you!" I cried. "Didn't you promise</seg><seg type="columnLine">me you wouldn't try your invention on any struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not," he declared decisively. "I merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed not to render invisible any structure con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining human occupants. This building is vacant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A strike is in progress and the place is deserted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you promised not to do anything whieh</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cause a panic or trouble," I persisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I intend to keep my promise," he replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I shall defer my experiment until the noon hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the streets will be practically deserted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there can be no panic. And I fail to see how it</seg><seg type="columnLine">can cause any trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All arguments which I could offer were in vain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, I must confess, I was rather fascinated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend's suggestion. To cause a towering steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stone structure to vanish would, indeed, be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat,--if it could be done, and I was rather anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find what the effect on the public would be. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was still nearly two hours before noon we</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO COULD VANISH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">resumed our way, with Lemuel seeking new oppor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tunities to test his discovery on the public.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The sidewalks were thronged with shoppers, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">presently, as we pushed our way through the crowd,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a terrified shriek pierced the hum and noises of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">busy street, as my companion, either accidently or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thoughtlessly, bumped into a passing woman. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she collapsed in a faint I sprang forward; but Dr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Unsinn was before me. Completely forgetting that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he was invisible, he stooped down, raised the vic-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tim's head and then, lifting her in his arms, started</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for a nearby drug store. Instantly pandemonium</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">broke loose. Screams, shouts, frightened cries rose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the crowd which had quickly gathered, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">awed, unable to believe their eyes, men, women and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">children shoved, crowded, and fought to make way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the woman's form floating in air through their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">midst. For a moment my heart seemed to cease</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beating; All my fears appeared about to be justi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fied. In an instant there would be a panic with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crushed and trampled bodies and all the attendant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horrors. But for once the impending catastrophe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was stayed by the very panic and terror of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crowd. So intent were the people on the incredible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sight which had terrified them that they stood as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if turned to stone, petrified with amazement and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And then a still more incredible thing happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The woman's body suddenly vanished! Lemuel had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bethought himself, and, undoubtedly confused at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the conditions he had created, had tried to improve</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">matters by rendering his victim invisible. And the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemingly supernatural occurrences had been wit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nessed by myself as well as by the crowd, for, in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the melde the glasses had been wrenched from my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nose and were hanging, dangling, useless and tem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">porarily forgotten from my breast pocket. And as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the woman's form vanished a strange sound, half</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sigh, half groan, arose from the gaping multitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Before hundreds of eyes the impossible had taken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">place. A woman had fainted, without reason or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cause she had risen and had floated through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">air and had utterly vanished in the midst of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crowd. For an instant they remained spellbound,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">awed into absolute silence. And in that instant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lemuel had entered the drug store with his burden</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and had deposited her gently but hurriedly upon a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chair, where, as instantaneously as she had van-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ished, she again resumed her customary form. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every occupant of the shop had rushed to the doors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and windows to see what was taking place on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">street, nobody noticed the sudden reappearance of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the woman. To me it was all nearly as surprising</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as to the public, but I had sense enough left to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hastily don my glasses, as Lemuel slipped past the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white-clad employees of the store, and, taking care</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not to collide with another bystander, rejoined me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We had no desire to linger and see the results of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the affair, and hurried from the crowd and turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into a nearby cross street. I could scarcely berate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my friend for what had occurred, for it had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an unavoidable accident, but I did not hesitate to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">use it as an example of the dire results which might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">follow if he kept on with his experiment or made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his secret public.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Lemuel was, however, far more excited and dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turbed than I, and without even attempting to re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ply he rushed into a subway entrance. Without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stopping to think he hurried to the change booth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and thrust a quarter under the wicket. Without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glancing up, the occupant shoved back five nickels,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and my friend gathered them up. But as the coins</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slid from the wooden shelf and vanished without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">apparent reason, and with no human hand grasping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them, the man peered from his cage. An expression</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of mortal terror swept across his stolid features,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and, with an inarticulate, choking cry, he reeled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">backward from his stool. But Lemuel did not stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The events of the past few minutes had completely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upset him, and the scientific mind when upset often</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">becomes panicky. For the moment he had, no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doubt, completely forgotten that he was invisible,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and, rushing forward, he boarded the train with me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at his heels. Fortunately it was a dull hour for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the subway-my friend was not forced to jostle or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">push his way, which most assuredly would have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resulted in further troubles--■--less than half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen passengers were within the car which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered. Lemuel sat silent, evidently composing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thoughts, and fumbling in one of his pockets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next moment a terrified shout reechoed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car; a woman fainted; the guard appeared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door; there was the hissing of released air, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train came to a jolting, lurching stop. I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">premonition of what had occurred, and, snatching</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the pink glasses, I found my worst fears more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than fulfilled. The car and its ooeupants had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely disappeared! With eyes fairly popping from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sockets, mouth agape, and shaking as if with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ague, the guard stood on the platform of the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">car, staring, utterly aghast, at the void that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched between him and the car ahead. Reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">and instinet told him it was impossible, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses told him that a car had completely vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">while speeding at fifty miles an hour, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken its passengers along with it. So thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened and flabbergasted was the guard that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even Lemuel's voice, issuing from space, failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attract his attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound the thing!" exclaimed my companion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I must have pressed the wrong button, or it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been shifted when I carried that fainting wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Likely as not it was injured when that mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erable creature seated herself in my lap. Now--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God, man! Can't you do something?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried, visions of the car and its oceupants remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing forever invisible flashing through my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as instantaneously and unexpectedly as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had vanished, the car was once more in the train.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had all occurred in a few seconds, and the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered passengers stared about, rubbing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes as if awakening from a dream, while the guard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinking and muttering, jerked the signal cord and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train again rumbled on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately for all concerned, Dr. Unsinn had</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to get his devilish machine to function</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly, and no harm had come of the incident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I had had about enough of it all, and I feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, at any moment, the apparatus might fail en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely or might do the wrong thing. At the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop I left the train, forcing my friend along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, and, dragging Km into an obscure corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">912</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the station platform where there was no chance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being overheard, I expressed my view of his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment in no gentle terms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't expect a delicate device to withstand</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred and fifty pounds of feminine flesh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone, can you?" he demanded. "I'm not surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was temporarily disarranged. But it's en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely right now. If you don't believe it I'll demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strate it right here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you dare!" I exclaimed. "You'll resume</seg><seg type="columnLine">your normal form as a demonstration, and we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to lunch. Then back to my apartments and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of this experiment. You've caused enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble for one day and I'll have a nervous break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down if this sort of thing continues."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll agree on one condition," replied Lemuel</seg><seg type="columnLine">with more readiness than I had expected. "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to try my experiment on that unfinished</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. After that I'll cease my experiment for</seg><seg type="columnLine">today."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In vain I argued. Lemuel could be as obstinate</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a mule at times, and, at last, realizing that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bound to carry out his desires and that if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">left him he might bring about dire results when</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, I assented to his condition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, with Dr. Unsinn once more his usual self,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we found a quiet restaurant where I was accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dining. The waiter, having taken our order,</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed me a copy of the latest edition of a paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, half fearfully, I glanced through it, expect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to find an account of one or more of the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurrences for which we had been responsible. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing had appeared, and I decided that, in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability, the witnesses had not cared to report</seg><seg type="columnLine">an experience which would expose them to ridicule</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a suspicion of insanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lemuel was in high spirits. To be sure, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made one or two mistakes, but, in each case, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took care to point out to me, his errors had, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he put it, added to the value of his experiment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his observations. And he could not resist crow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over me a bit when he called my attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that neither panic nor disasters had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is exactly as I foresaw," he declared. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely new and unknown does not terrorize hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man beings. Wonder and amazement temporarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyze the muscles, and, as you should know, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposed impressions cannot occupy the mind at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time. Hence fear cannot have a place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder is predominant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, my friend, your fears of my discovery creat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a panic or causing terror and shock are ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely unfounded."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You forget about the woman who fainted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man in the subway," I reminded him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Utterly beside the question," he snorted. "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case of the woman it was bodily contact which</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened her, and, in the other case, the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money vanished. In neither case was it due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fright at my invisibility."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's hopeless to argue with you," I said. "In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly, your invisibility was at the bottom of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Heaven alone knows what a panic might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">resulted if that car had remained invisible long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for the passengers of the other cars to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigated the cause of the train stopping."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can and shall prove I am right," he declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come, we'll have a try at that building and I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">wager no one will be terrified."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For Heaven's sake, don't vanish here!" I cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I saw Lemuel reach towards an inner pocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wait until we are alone. I'd suggest a telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">booth as the most convenient and safest spot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few moments later my friend entered a booth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost instantly emerged, visible only to my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Hailing a taxi, we were soon in the vicinity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the partly completed Hartwell Building. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lunch hour and very few persons were on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. Opposite the building a chauffeur dozed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his taxi, two fruit vendors argued in vociferous</seg><seg type="columnLine">Italian on the corner, and a few pedestrians who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dined early were wandering about gazing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop windows. Entering the main doorway of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building we found ourselves in the spacious rotunda</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its litter of discarded building materials and</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned scaffoldings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, here we are!" exclaimed Lemuel gleefully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now, if my pocket apparatus can produce results</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this edifice I shall feel that nothing is too greai</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be rendered invisible. Entire armies, navies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities, yes---:--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I hope it doesn't work," I interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But my hopes were in vain. As Lemuel had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking, he had adjusted his instrument and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely had my last word been uttered, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty stories of concrete, steel and stone dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved about us, leaving us, invisible to others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in air above the yawning abyss of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundation excavation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a brief instant no one within sight appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to notice that the structure had vanished. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dozing chauffeur jerked upright, his jaw sag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ged, and with a wild yell he sat transfixed, pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">dramatically at the empty lot where the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stood. At his cry everyone on the street turned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shouts and exclamations drew occupants of stores</seg><seg type="columnLine">and restaurants on the run. With screeching horns</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxis came tearing into the street, and in almost no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time Nineteenth Street was filled with a gaping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesticulating, excited crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't I tell you so?" cried Lemuel trium-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phantly. "No one is frightened. All--His</seg><seg type="columnLine">words were cut short by the clanging of a bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a patrol wagon came dashing around a corner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while from the opposite direction, the screaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">siren of a fire truck added to the uproar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!" I cried, "Someone's called the policc</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned in a fire alarm. In a minute they'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. They'll find us and there'll be the devil to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lemuel roared with glee. "You forget we're in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible" he reminded me. "And it will be highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusing to witness the reactions of the police and</seg><seg type="columnLine">firemen when they find solid walls where obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are none. And imagine the results when those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who succeed in entering vanish instantly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turn off the damnable machine instantly," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded him, "this has gone far enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The police and firemen were advancing towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, hesitatingly but determined, although what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WHO</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to accomplish or why they imagined their</seg><seg type="columnLine">services were required, is still a mystery to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I have said before, habit is one of the strongest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of influences. Dr. Unsinn, being a great respector</seg><seg type="columnLine">of law, and seeing the police approaching, suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumbed to force of habit and almost involuntarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped his mechanism. Instantly the huge build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing once more towered above the street, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse cry of warning and alarm, the crowd broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fled, seeking refuge in doorways and stores as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if fearing the structure might crash thundering in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the street. Even the police sprang back, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the firemen, to their credit be it said, stood their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, and, thinking something was expected of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, turned half a dozen streams of water on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. In the excitement Lemuel and I slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen from a rear entrance and hurried from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight around a corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite all my experiences with my friend's dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery I was shaken and upset by this latest demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stration of his power, and even Lemuel was, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see, in a highly excitable frame of mind. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">device had exceeded even his most sanguine ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectations and his experiment had, from his point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of view, been a huge success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several times he started to speak, but each time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I checked him, for the sidewalks were thronged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pedestrians and I had no desire to have atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion turned towards us after our latest achieve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were now in a shopping district, and as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked along, picking our way with care in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Lemuel might not jostle some passer-by, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed a rough-looking, heavily-built fellow loiter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing near the edge of the sidewalk and furtively</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing at each woman who passed him. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he darted forward, snatched a handbag from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stylishly-dressed girl, and dashed up the street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Screaming that she had been robbed, the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">started after him. Cries of "Stop thief!" re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded from every side, and a score of persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and gave chase. Lemuel and I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest to the fellow, and with one accord we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him, quite forgetting that one of us was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible. Dashing around a corner, the rascal</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered an almost deserted side street with us at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels and the howling mob half a block in the rear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In my youth I had been something of a runner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lemuel had, it flashed over me, won the coveted "S"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our university as a sprinter. Rapidly we gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the fellow, and, as he turned to duck into an</seg><seg type="columnLine">alleyway, Lemuel grasped him by the coat with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">command to halt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly, and without stopping, the fellow half</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and dealt a vicious, back-handed blow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his doubled fist. It caught Lemuel full in the face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a gasping cry he staggered back into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms with a two inch gash laying bare the cheek</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone and blood gushing from the wound. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">even at that moment, while supporting my injured</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrade, my attention was focussed upon the ruf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fian who had struck him down. Feeling the impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his fist upon a fellow-being's flesh, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled, and, the next moment, stood rooted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of a form stretched on the pavement or a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">COULD VANISH	913</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">battered man staggering back, not a living soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">was near with the exception of myself. The fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low's eyes grew wide, his mouth opened, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next moment he uttered a terrified scream, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping the hand-bag fell to his knees, covering</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes with his hands, babbling incoherently, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking with mortal fear. Upon the flagging be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore me was a blotch of blood, and, from nowhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drops of blood were slowly adding to the crimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool. Lemuel might be invisible but the blood from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wound was not. To the cowering, superstitious</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretch, the blood, slowly dripping from an unseen</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim, must have been a most awful and terrifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The oncoming mob now was nearly upon us, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen fears swept through my confused brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What if the blood stains on the pavement attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention and an explanation were demanded? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">would happen to my invisible companion, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob, dashing onward, bore him down and trampled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him under foot? And what if the cowering wretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us blurted out the truth? But I need not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have worried. So intent were the man-chasers up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their quarry that they gave no heed even to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a moment, the red blotch was completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliterated by scores of feet, as the ci'owd sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded us and seized the thief who offered no re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance. And almost by a miracle Dr. Unsinn</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped the fate I had feared. I sprang behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the mob reached us and thus partially shielded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but despite this, the shouting, panting, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiring crowd jostled and bumped him, tearing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat half from his shoulders, knocking his spectacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the street where they were instantly ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bits underfoot, tearing his collar awry, knocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his hat and, as I knew from his half-stifled</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunts, exclamations and ejaculations, giving him</seg><seg type="columnLine">many a painful jab and bump with elbows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. But in that hub-bub, the cries of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one man were inaudible, and as everyone jostled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed his neighbor no one noticed that an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible but solid human form was in their midst.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luckily the mob surged forward around the thief</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left a fairly clear space through which I half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged, half-pushed my battered, bruised and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hevelled comrade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Attracted by the commotion, half a dozen taxis</seg><seg type="columnLine">had drawn up to the curb, their drivers craning</seg><seg type="columnLine">their necks and peering into the milling crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the captive, and giving no heed to anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else. Quickly opening the door of the nearest, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundled Lemuel inside, and, at last succeeding in</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining the chauffeur's attention, I ordered him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive off. He turned with a half-uttered oath and</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to move, but noticing my own rumpled ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance, and realizing I had been in the thick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble, his tone changed and he asked what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all about. In a few words I explained that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely a purse-snatcher, and that I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked over in the mel6e. For an instant he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed suspiciously at me, for my hands were a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">smeared with Lemuel's blood, and for a brief instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">I trembled for fear he would drive us to the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">police station.

It is impressive in its daring and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">breadth, yet it is not at all impossible, perhaps not even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">improbable. If, as we know, it is impossible for creatures</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to roam about the Moon, due to its lack of atmosphere, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if there is an atmosphere within the Moon, then creatures</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the kind'that Mr. IVells paints so vividly in this story</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might well be expected to be seen there, if explorers ever"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">land upon that satellite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw a little blue tongue upon the edge of it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled, and crept, and spread!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quietly the whole sheet, save where it lay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate contact with the snow, charred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrivelled and sent up a quivering thread of smoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no doubt left to me; the atmosphere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon was either pure oxygen or air, and capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore--unless its tenuity was excessive--of</seg><seg type="columnLine">supporting our alien life. We might emerge--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">live!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat down with my legs on either side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manhole and prepared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unscrew it, but Cavor</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped me. "There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">first a little precaution,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. He pointed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that although there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly an oxygenated</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere outside, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might still be so rarefied</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to cause us grave in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jury. He reminded me</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mountain sickness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bleeding that often</seg><seg type="columnLine">afflicts aeronauts who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ascended too swiftly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">MMmaiMiHW * BTIhWwnami and he spent some time in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                   the preparation of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickly-tasting drink which he insisted on my shar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. It made me feel a little numb, but otherwise</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no effect on me. Then he permitted me to begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">unscrewing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the glass stopper of the manhole was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sp far undone that the denser air within our sphere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">915</seg><seg type="columnLine">916</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">began to escape along the thread of the screw, sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as a kettle sings before it boils. Thereupon he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me desist. It speedily became evident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure outside was very much less than it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">within. How much less it was we had no means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of telling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sat grasping the stopper with both hands, ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to close it again if, in spite of our intense hope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lunar atmosphere should after all prove too</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarefied for us, and Cavor sat with a cylinder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">compressed oxygen at hand to restore our pressure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We looked at one another in silence, and then at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fantastic vegetation that swayed and grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">visibly and noiselessly without. And ever that shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">piping continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My blood-vessels began to throb in my ears, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of Cavor's movements diminished. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted how still everything had become, because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thinning of the air.	&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As our air sizzled out from the screw the mois-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of it condensed in little puffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently I experienced a peculiar shortness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath that lasted indeed during the whole of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of our exposure to the moon's exterior atmo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere, and a rather unpleasant sensation about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears and finger-nails and the back of the throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew upon my attention, and presently passed off</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But then came vertigo and nausea that abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed the quality of my courage. I gave the lid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the manhole half a turn and made a hasty ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation to Cavor; but now he was the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanguine. He answered me in a voice that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinarily small and remote, because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinness of the air that carried the sound. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">commended a nip of brandy, and set me the example,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently I felt better. I turned the manhole</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopper back again. The throbbing in my ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew louder, and then I remarked that the piping</seg><seg type="columnLine">note of the outrush had ceased. For a time I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be sure that it had ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" said Cavor, in the ghost of a voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall we go on?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I thought. "Is this all ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you can stand it," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By way of answer I went on unsci'ewing. I lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circular operculum from its place and laid it</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully on the bale. A flake or so of snow whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vanished as that thin and unfamiliar air took</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of our sphere. I knelt, and then seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself at the edge of the manhole, peering over it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beneath, within a yard of my face, lay the untrod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den snow of the moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a little pause. Our eyes met.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It doesn't distress your lungs too much?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," I said. "I can stand this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stretched out his hand for his blanket, thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head through its central hole, and wrapped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. He sat down on the edge of the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole, he let his feet drop until they were within six</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches of the lunar ground. He hesitated for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, then thrust himself forward, dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">these intervening inches, and stood upon the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trodden soil of the moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he stepped forward he was refracted grotes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quely by the edge of the glass. He stood for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment looking this way and that. Then he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself together and leapt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The glass distorted everything, but it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me even then to be an extremely big leap. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one bound become remote. He seemed twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">or thirty feet off. He was standing high upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky mass and gesticulating back to me. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was shouting--but the sound did not reach me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But how the deuce had he done this? I felt like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who has just seen a new conjuring trick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a puzzled state of mind I too dropped through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manhole. I stood up. Just in front of me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snowdrift had fallen away and made a sort of ditch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I made a step and jumped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found myself flying through the air, saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock on which he stood coming to meet me, clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and clung in a state of infinite amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gasped a painful laugh. I was tremendously</seg><seg type="columnLine">confused. Cavor bent down and shouted in piping</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones for me to be careful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had forgotten that on the moon, with only an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eightieth part of the earth's mass and a quarter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its diameter, my weight was barely a sixth what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on earth. But now that fact insisted on being</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are out of Mother Earth's leading-strings</seg><seg type="columnLine">now," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a guarded effort I raised myself to the top,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moving as cautiously as a rheumatic patient,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up beside him under the blaze of the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sphere lay behind us on its dwindling snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drift thirty feet away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As far as the eye could see over the enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">disorder of rocks that formed the crater floor, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same bristling scrub that surrounded us was start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into life, diversified here and there by bulging</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of a cactus form, and scarlet and purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">lichens that grew so fast they seemed to crawl over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks. The whole area of the crater seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me then to be one similar wilderness up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very foot of the surrounding cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This cliff was apparently bare of vegetation save</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its base, and with buttresses and terraces and</seg><seg type="columnLine">platforms that did not very greatly attract our</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention at the time. It was many miles away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in every direction, we seemed to be almost at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the centre of the crater, and we saw it through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain haziness that drove before the wind. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was even a wind now in the thin air, a swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet weak wind that chilled exceedingly but exerted</seg><seg type="columnLine">little pressure. It was blowing round the crater, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed, to the hot illuminated side from the foggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness under the sunward wall. It was difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look into this eastward fog; we had to peer with</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-closed eyes beneath the shade of our hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of the fierce intensity of the motionless sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems to be deserted," said Cavor, "absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">desolate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked about me again. I retained even then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging hope of some quasi-human evidence, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinnacle or building, some house or engine, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere one looked spread the tumbled rocks in</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaks and crests and the darting scrub and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">917</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bulging cacti that swelled and swelled, a fiat nega-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion as it seemed of all such hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It looks as though these plants had it to them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves," I said. "I see no trace of any other crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No insects--no birds--no! Not a trace, not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrap nor particle of animal life. If there was--</seg><seg type="columnLine">what would they do in the night? ... No; there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just these plants alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shaded my eyes with my hand. "It's like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landscape of a dream.

And the glare!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is only the fresh morning," said Cavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sighed and looked about him. "This is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">world for men," he said. "And yet in a way--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He became silent for a time, then commenced his</seg><seg type="columnLine">meditative humming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I started at a gentle touch, and found a thin sheet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of livid lichen lapping over my shoe.

A sudden blaze of pink had crept *up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged pillar of crag. It was a most extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink, a livid magenta.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" said I, turning, and behold, Cavor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant I stood transfixed. Then I made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasty step to look over the verge of the rock. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my surprise at his disappearance I forgot once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more that we were on the moon. The thrust of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my foot that I made in striding would have carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a yard on earth; on the moon it carried me six</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a good five yards over the edge. For the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing had something of the effect of those night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mares when one falls and falls. For while one</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls sixteen feet in the first second of a fall on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, on the moon one falls two, and with only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a^sixth of one's weight. I fell, or rather I jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, about ten yards I-suppose. It seemed to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a long time, five or six seconds, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">think. I floated through the air and fell like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feather, knee-deep in a snow-drift in the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gully of blue-gray, white-veined rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked about me. ''Cavor!" I cried; but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor was visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cavor!" I cried louder, and the rocks echoed me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned fiercely to the rocks and clambered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the summit of them. "Cavor!" I cried. My voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded like the voice of a lost lamb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sphere, too, was not in sight, and for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment a -horrible feeling of desolation pinched</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I saw him. He was laughing and gesticu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating to attract my attention. He was on a bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">patch of rock twenty or thirty yards away. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hear his voice, but "jump" said his gestures. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated, the distance seemed enormous. Yet I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected that surely I must be able to clear a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater distance than Cavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made a step back, gathered myself together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leapt -with all my might. I seemed to shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">right up in the air as though I should never come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was horrible and delightful, and as wild as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmare, to go flying off in this fashion. I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">my leap had been altogether too violent. I flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean over Cavor's head and beheld a spiky con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion in a gully spreading to meet my fall. I gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a yelp of alarm. I put out my hands and straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened my legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hit a huge fungoid bulk that burst all about me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattering a mass of orange spores in every direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and covering me with orange powder. I rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over spluttering, and came to rest convulsed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathless laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I 'became aware of Cavor's little round face peer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over a bristling hedge. He shouted some faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiry. "Eh?" I tried to shout, but could not do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so for want of breath. He made his way towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, coming gingerly among the bushes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got to be careful," he said. "This moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">has no discipline. She'll let us smash ourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He helped me to my feet. "You exerted your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self too much," he said, dabbing at the yellow stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hand to remove it from my garments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stood passive and panting, allowing him to beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the spores from my knees and elbows and lecture</seg><seg type="columnLine">me upon my misfortunes. "We don't quite allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the gravitation. Our muscles are scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">educated yet. We must practise a little, when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have got your breath."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I pulled two or three little thorns out of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and sat for a time on a boulder of rock. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles were quivering, and I had that feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal disillusionment that comes at the first fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the learner of cycling on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It suddenly occurred to Cavor that the cold air</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the gully, after the brightness of the sun, might</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me a fever. So we clambered back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight. We found that beyond a few abrasions</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had received no serious injuries from my tumble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at Cavor's suggestion we were presently looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">round for some safe and easy landing-place for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">next leap. We chose a rocky slab some ten yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, separated from us by a little thicket of olive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">green spikes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Imagine it there!" said Cavor, who was assum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the airs of a trainei*-, and he pointed to a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">about four feet from my toes. This leap I managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">without difficulty, and I must confess I found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain satisfaction in Cavor's falling short by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot or so and tasting the spikes of the scrub. "One</seg><seg type="columnLine">has to be careful, you see," he said, pulling out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thorns, and with that he ceased to be my mentor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and became my fellow-learner in the art of lunar</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We chose a still easier jump and did it without</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty, and then leapt back again, and to and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fro several times, accustoming our muscles to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new standard. I could never have believed had</seg><seg type="columnLine">I not experienced it, how rapid that adaptation</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be. In a very little time indeed, certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">after fewer than thirty leaps, we could judge the</seg><seg type="columnLine">.918</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">effort necessary for a distance -with almost ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrial assurance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And all this time the lunar plants were growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">around us, higher and denser and more entangled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every moment thicker and taller, spiked plants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">green cactus 'masses, fungi, fleshy and lichenous</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, strangest radiate and sinuous shapes. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were so intent upon our leaping, that for a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">we gave no heed to their unfaltering expansion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An extraordinary elation had taken possession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us. Partly, I think, it was our sense of release</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the confinement of the sphere. Mainly, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, the thin sweetness of the air, which I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain contained a much larger proportion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen than our terrestrial atmosphere. In spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strange quality of all about us, I felt as</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventurous and experimental as a cockney would</seg><seg type="columnLine">do placed for the first time among mountains; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do not think it occurred to either of us, face to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face though we were with the unknown, to be very</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were bitten by a spirit of enterprise. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected a lichenous kopje perhaps fifteen yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and landed neatly on its summit one after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. "Good!" we cried to each other; "good!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Cavor made three steps and went off to a tempt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing slope of snow a good twenty yards and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond. I stood for a moment struck by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque effect of his soaring figure--his dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">cricket cap, and spiky hair, his little round body, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and his knickerbockered legs tucked up tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">--against the weird spaciousness of the lunar scene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A gust of laughter seized me, and then I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to follow. Plump! I dropped beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We made a few Gargantuan strides, leapt three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four times more, and sat down at last in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lichenous hollow. Our lungs were painful. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat holding our sides and recovering our breath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking appreciation at one another. Cavor panted</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about "amazing sensations." And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a thought into my head. For the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did not seem a particularly appalling thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply a natural question arising out of the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the way," I said, "where exactly is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cavor looked at me. "Eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The full meaning of what we were saying struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">me sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cavor!" I cried, laying a hand on his arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"where is the sphere?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lost Men in the Moon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS face caught something of my dismay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood up and stared about him at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrub that fenced us in and i-ose about us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining upward in a passion of growth. He put</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dubious hand to his lips. He spoke with a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of assurance. "I think," he said slowly, "we left</seg><seg type="columnLine">it . . . somewhere . . . about there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed a hesitating finger that wavered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not sure." His look of consternation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">deepened. "Anyhow," he said, with his eyes on me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it can't be far."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We had both stood up. We made unmeaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">ejaculations, our eyes sought in the twining,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickening jungle round about us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All about us on the sunlit slopes frothed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed the darting shrubs, the swelling cactus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creeping lichens, and wherever the shade re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained the snowdrifts lingered. North, south, east</seg><seg type="columnLine">and west spread an identical monotony of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar forms. And somewhere, buried among</seg><seg type="columnLine">this tangled confusion, was our sphere, our home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our only provision, our only hope of escape from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fantastic wilderness of ephemeral growths into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think, after all," he said, pointing suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"it might be over there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," I said. "We have turned in a curve. Seef</seg><seg type="columnLine">here is the mark of my heels. It's clear the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be more to the eastward, much more. No!--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere must be over there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think" said Cavor, "I kept the sun upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my right all the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Every leap, it seems to me," I said, "my shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew before me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stared into one another's eyes. The area of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crater had become enormously vast to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginations, the growing thickets already im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrably dense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good heavens! What fools we have been!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's evident that we must find it again," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor, "and that soon. The sun grows stronger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We should be fainting with the heat already if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't so dry. And . . . I'm hungry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared at him. I had not suspected this aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the matter before. But it came to me at once--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a positive craving. "Yes," I said with emphasis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am hungry too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood up with a look of active resolution.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Certainly we must find the sphere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As calmly as possible we surveyed the intermin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able reefs and thickets that formed the floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater, each of us weighing in silence the chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our finding the sphere before we were over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken by heat and hunger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It can't be fifty yards from here," said Cavor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with indecisive gestures. "The only thing is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat round about until we come upon it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is all we can do," I said, without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">alacrity to begin our hunt. "I wish this confounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">spike bush did not grow so fast!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's just it," said Cavor. "But it was lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a bank of snow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared about me in the vain hope of recognising</seg><seg type="columnLine">some knoll or shrub that had been near the sphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But everywhere was a confusing sameness, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the aspiring bushes, the distending fungi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dwindling snow banks, steadily and inevitably</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. The sun scorched and stung, and faint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of an unaccountable hunger mingled with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinite perplexity. And even as we stood there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">confused and lost amidst unprecedented things, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">became aware for the first time of a sound upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon other than the stir of the growing plants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faint sighing of the wind, or those that we our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves had made.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">919</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Boom. . . Boom. . . . Boom. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came from beneath our feet, a sound in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. We seemed to hear it with our feet as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as with our ears. Its dull resonance was muffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by distance, thick with the quality of intervening</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance. No sound that I can imagine could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished us more, or have changed more com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely . the quality of things about us. For this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound, rich, slow, and deliberate, seemed to us as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it could be nothing but the striking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some gigantic buried clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Boom. . . . Boom. . . . Boom. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sound suggestive of still cloisters, of sleepless</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights in crowded cities, of vigils and the awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, of all that is orderly and methodical in life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">booming out pregnant and mysterious in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic desert! To the eye everything was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed : the desolation of bushes and cacti waving</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently in the wind, stretched unbroken to the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant cliffs, the still dark sky was empty overhead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the hot sun hung and burned. And through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all, a warning, a threat, throbbed this enigma</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Boom. . . . Boom. . . . Boom. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We questioned one another in faint and faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices. "A clock?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like a clock!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can it be?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Count," was Cavor's belated suggestion, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that word the striking ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The silence, the rhythmic disappointment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, came as a fresh shock. For a moment one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could doubt whether one had ever heard a sound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or whether it might not still be going on. Had I</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed heard a sound?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt the pressure of Cavor's hand upon my arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He spoke in an undertone, as though he feared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake some sleeping thing. "Let us keep together,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he whispered, "and look for the sphere. We must</seg><seg type="columnLine">get back to the sphere. This is beyond our under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Which way shall we go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hesitated. An intense persuasion of pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sences, of unseen things about us and near us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominated our minds. What could they be? Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">could they be? Was this arid desolation, alternately</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen and scorched, only the outer rind and mask</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some subterranean world? And if so, what sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of world? What sort of inhabitants might it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently disgorge upon us?	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, stabbing the aching stillness as vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sudden as an unexpected thunderclap, came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clang and rattle as though great gates of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">had suddenly been flung apart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It arrested our steps. We stood gaping helplessly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Cavor stole towards me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not understand!" he whispered close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my face. He waved his hand vaguely skyward, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague suggestion of still vaguer thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A hiding-place! If anything came. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked about us. I nodded my head in assent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We started off, moving stealthily with the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">exaggerated precautions against noise. We went</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards a thicket of scrub. A clangour, like ham-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mers flung about a boiler, hastened our steps. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must crawl," whispered Cavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lower leaves of the bayonet plants, already</seg><seg type="columnLine">overshadowed by the newer ones above, were begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to wilt and shrivel so that we could thrust our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way in among the thickening stems without serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">injury. A stab in the face or arm we did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">heed. At the heart of the thicket I stopped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared panting into Cavor's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Subterranean,"f&lt; he whispered. "Below."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They may come out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must find the sphere!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I said; "but how?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Crawl till we come to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But if we don't?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep hidden. See what they are like."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will keep together," said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought. "Which way shall we go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must take our chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We peered this way and that. Then very cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumspectly, we began to crawl through the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle, making, so far as we could judge, a circuit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">halting now at every waving fungus, at every sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intent only on the sphere from which we had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolishly emerged. Ever and again from out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth beneath us came concussions, beatings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, inexplicable mechanical sounds; and once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then again, we thought we heard something,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint rattle and tumult, borne to us through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. But fearful as we were we dared essay no</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage-point to survey the crater. For long we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw nothing of the beings whose sounds were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">abundant and insistent. But for the faintness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hunger and the drying of our throats that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling would have had the quality of a very vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream. It was so absolutely unreal. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">element with any touch of reality was these sounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Figure it to yourself! About us the dream-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle, with the silent bayonet leaves darting over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and the silent, vivid, sun-splashed lichens</seg><seg type="columnLine">under our hands and knees, waving with the vigour</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their growth as a carpet waves when the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets beneath it. Ever and again one of the bladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungi, bulging and distending under the sun, loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us. Ever and again some novel shape in vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">colour obtruded. The very cells that built up these</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants were as large as my thumb, like beads of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coloured glass. And all these things were saturated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the unmitigated glare of the sun, were seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a sky that was bluish black and spangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">still, in spite of the sunlight, with a few surviving</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars. Strange! the very forms and texture of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones were strange. It was all strange, the feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one's body was unprecedented, every other move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment ended in a surprise.

We crawled, as it seemed, a long time before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw either Selenite or mooncalf, though we heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">i he bellowing and grunting noises of these latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually drawing nearer to us. We crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">through stony ravines, over snow slopes, amidst</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungi that ripped like thin bladders at our thrust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">emitting a watery humour, over a perfect pavement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of things like puff-balls, and beneath interminable</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickets of scrub. And ever more hopelessly our</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes sought for our abandoned sphere. The noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mooncalves would at times be a vast flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">calf-like sound, at times it rose to an amazed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrathy bellowing, and again it would become a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clogged bestial sound as though these unseen crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures had sought to eat and bellow at the same time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our first view was but an inadequate transitory</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse, yet none the less disturbing because it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was incomplete. -Cavor was crawling in front at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, and he was first to become aware of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximity. He stopped dead, arresting me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A crackling and smashing of the scrub appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be advancing directly upon us, and then, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted close and endeavoured to judge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearness and direction of this noise, there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific bellow behind us, so close and vehement that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tops of the bayonet scrub bent before it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one felt the breath of it hot and moist. And, turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about, we saw indistinctly through a crowd of</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying stems the mooncalf's shining sides, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long line of its back loomed out against the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course it is hard for me now. to say how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 saw at that time, because my impressions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">corrected by subsequent observation. First of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressions was its enormous size; the girth r,f its</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was some fourscore feet, its length perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred. Its sides rose and fell with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboured breathing. I perceived that its gigantic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flabby body lay along the ground, and that its skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of a corrugated white, dappling into blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the backbone. But of its feet we saw nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think also that we saw then the profile at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the almost brainless head, with its fat-encum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered neck, its slobbering omnivorous mouth, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">little nostrils, and tight shut eyes. (For the moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">calf invariably shuts its eyes in the presence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun.) We had a glimpse of a vast red pit as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened its mouth to bleat and bellow again; we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a breath from the pit, and then the monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">heeled over like a ship, dragged forward along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, creasing all its leathery skin, rolled again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so wallowed past us, smashing a path amidst</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scrub, and was speedily hidden from our eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the dense interlacings beyond. Another appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">more distantly, and then another, and then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he was guiding these animated lumps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">provender to their pasture, a Selenite came momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily into ken. My grip upon Cavor's foot became</seg><seg type="columnLine">convulsive at the sight of him, and we remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless and peering long after he had passed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By contrast with the mooncalves he seemed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trivial being, a mere ant, scarcely five feet high.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was wearing garments of some leathery sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, so that no portion of his actual body ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, but of this, of course, we were entirely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant. He presented himself, therefore, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">compact, bristling creature, having much of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of a complicated insect, with whip-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacles and a clanging arm projecting from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining cylindrical body case. The form of his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hidden by his enormous many-spiked helmet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">we discovered afterwards that he used the spikes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for prodding refractory mooncalves--and a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">goggles of darkened glass, set very much at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, gave a bird-like quality to the metallic ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus that covered his face. His arms did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">project beyond his body case, and he carried him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self upon short legs that, wrapped though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in warm coverings, seemed to our terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes inordinately flimsy. They had very short</seg><seg type="columnLine">thighs, very long shanks, and little feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of his heavy-looking clothing, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">progressing with what would be, from the terres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial point of view, very considerable strides, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his clanging arm was busy. The quality of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion during the instant of his passing suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste and a certain anger, and soon after we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost sight of him we heard the bellow' of a moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">calf change abruptly into a short, sharp squeal, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by the scuffle of its acceleration. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually that bellowing receded, and then came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an end, as if the pastures sought had been attained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We listened. For a space the moon world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. But it was some time before we resumed our</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling search for the vanished sphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When next we saw mooncalves they were some</seg><seg type="columnLine">little distance away from us in a place of tumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks. The less vertical surfaces of the rocks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick with a speckled green plant growing in dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">mossy clumps, upon which these creatures were</seg><seg type="columnLine">browsing. We stopped at the edge of the reeds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidst which we were crawling, at the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, peering out at them and looking round for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second glimpse of a Selenite. They lay against</seg><seg type="columnLine">their food like stupendous slugs, huge, greasy hulls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating greedily and noisily, with a sort of sobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">avidity. They seemed monsters of mere fatness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumsy and overwhelmed to a degree that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a Smithfield ox seem a model of agility. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy, writhing, chewing mouths, and eyes closed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">together with the appetising sound of their munch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, made up an effect of animal enjoyment that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was singularly stimulating to our empty frames.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hogs!" said Cavor, with unusual passion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Disgusting hogs!" and after one glare of angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">envy crawled off through the bushes to our right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">T stayed long enough to see that the speckled plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite hopeless .for human nourishment, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled after him, nibbling a quill of it between my</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently we were arrested again by the proxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mity of a Selenite, and this time we were able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">observe him more exactly. Now we could see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Selenite covering was indeed clothing, and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of crustacean integument. He was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar in his costume to the former one we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpsed, except that ends of something like wad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding were protruding from his neck, and he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a promontory of rock and moved his head this</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and that, as though he were surveying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater. We lay quite still, fearing to attract hi8</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">921</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">attention if we moved, and after a time he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We came upon another drove of mooncalves bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing up a ravine, and then we passed over a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sounds, sounds of beating machinery, as if some</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge hall of industry came near the surface there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And while these sounds were still about us we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the edge of a great open space, perhaps two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards in diameter, and perfectly level.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Save for a few lichens that advanced from its mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin this space was bare, and presented a powdery</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of a dusty yellow colour. We were afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to strike out across this space, but as it presented</seg><seg type="columnLine">less obstruction to our crawling than the scrub, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down upon it and began very circumspectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to skirt its edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a little while the noises from below ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">and everything, save for the faint stir of the grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing vegetation, was very still. Then abruptly there</seg><seg type="columnLine">began an uproar, louder, more vehement, and nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any we had so far heard. Of a certainty it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from below. Instinctively we crouched as</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat as we could, ready for a prompt plunge into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicket beside us. Each knock and throb seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to vibrate through our bodies. Louder grew this</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing and beating, and that irregular vibration</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased until the whole moon world seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerking and pulsing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cover," whispered Cavor; and I turned towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bushes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that instant came a thud like the thud of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun, and then a thing happened--it still haunts me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my dreams. I had turned my head to look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor's face, and thrust out my hand in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as I did so. And my hand met nothing! Plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly into a bottomless hole!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  My chest hit something hard, and I found myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my chin on the edge of an unfathomable abyss</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had suddenly opened beneath me, my hand ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended stiffly into the void. The whole of that flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular area was no more than a gigantic lid, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now sliding sideways from .off the pit it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered into a slot prepared for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Had it not been for Cavor I think I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained rigid, hanging over this margin and star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the enormous gulf below, until at last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges of the slot scraped me off and hurled me into</seg><seg type="columnLine">its depths. But Cavor had not received the shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had paralysed me. He had been a little distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the edge when the lid had first opened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceiving the peril that held me helpless, gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">my legs and pulled me backward. I came into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting position, cx-awled away from the edge for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a space on all fours, then staggered up and ran after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him across the thundering, quivering sheet of metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed to be swinging open with a steadily ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celerated velocity, and the bushes in front of me</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted sideways as I ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was none too soon. Cavor's back vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">amidst the bristling thicket, and as I scrambled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him, the monstrous valve came, into its posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with a clang. For a long time we lay panting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not daring to approach the pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at last very cautiously and bit by bit we</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept into a position from which we could peer</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. The bushes about us creaked and waved</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with the force of a breeze that was blowing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shaft. We could see nothing at first except</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth vertical walls descending at last into an</seg><seg type="columnLine">impenetrable black. And then very gradually we</seg><seg type="columnLine">became aware of a number of very faint and little</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights going to and fro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time that stupendous gulf of mystery held</seg><seg type="columnLine">us so that we forgot even our sphere. In time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we grew more accustomed to the darkness, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make out very small, dim, elusive shapes mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about among those needle-point illuminations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We peered amazed and incredulous, understanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">so little that we could find no words to say. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">could distinguish nothing that would give us a clue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the meaning of the faint shapes we saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can it be?" I asked; "what can it be?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The engineering! . . . They must live in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">caverns during the night, and come out during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cavor!" I said. "Can they be--that--it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something like--men?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tlmt was not a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We dare risk nothing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We dare do nothing until we find the sphere!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We can do nothing until we find the sphere."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He assented with a groan and stirred himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move. He stared about him for a space, sighed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and indicated a direction. We struck out through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle. For a time we crawled resolutely, theu</seg><seg type="columnLine">with diminishing vigour. Presently among great</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes of flabby purple there came a noise of tramp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling and cries about us. We lay close, and for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time the sounds went to and fro and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">near. But this time we saw nothing. I tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper to Cavor that I could hardly go without</seg><seg type="columnLine">food much longer, but my mouth had become too</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry for whispering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cavor," I said, "I must have food."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned a face full of dismay towards me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a case for holding out," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I must" I said, "and look at my lips!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been thirsty some time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If only some of that snow had remained!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's clean gone! We're driving from arctic to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropical at the rate of a degree a minute. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gnawed my hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sphere!" he said. "There is nothing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it but the sphere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We roused ourselves to another spurt of crawling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My mind ran entirely on edible things, on the hiss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing profundity of summer drinks, more particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">I craved for beer. I was haunted by the memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sixteen gallon cask that had swaggered in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lympne cellar. I thought of the adjacent larder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and especially of steak and kidney pie--tender</seg><seg type="columnLine">steak and plenty of kidney, and rich, thick gravy</seg><seg type="columnLine">between. Ever and again I was seized with fits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry yawning. We came to flat places overgrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fleshy red things, monstrous coralline growths;</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we pushed against them they snapped, and broke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I noted the quality of the broken surfaces. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">confounded stuff certainly looked of a biteable</seg><seg type="columnLine">texture. Then it seemed to me that it smelt rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I picked up a fragment and sniffed at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cavor," I said in a hoarse undertone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">922</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced at me with his face screwed up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't," he said. I put down the fragment, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we crawled on through this tempting fleshiness for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cavor," I asked "why notl"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poison," I heard him say, but he did not look</seg><seg type="columnLine">round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We crawled some way before I decided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll chance it," said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made a belated gesture to prevent me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuffed my mouth full. He crouched watching my</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, his own twisted into the oddest expression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's good," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "0 Lord!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched me munch, his face wrinkled between</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire and disapproval, then suddenly succumbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to appetite and began to tear off huge mouthfuls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a time we did nothing but eat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stuff was not unlike a terrestrial mushroom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only it was much laxer in texture, and, as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowed it, it warmed the throat. At first we ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perienced a mere mechanical satisfaction in eating;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then our blood began to run warmer, and we tingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the lips and fingers, and then new and slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">irrelevant ideas came bubbling up in our minds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's good," said I. "Infernally good! What a</seg><seg type="columnLine">home for our surplus population! Our poor surplus</seg><seg type="columnLine">population," and I broke off another large portion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It filled me with a curiously benevolent satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction that there was such good food in the moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The depression of my hunger gave way to an irra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional exhilaration. The dread and discomfort in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had been living vanished entirely. I per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived the moon no longer as a planet from which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">most earnestly desired the means of escape, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a possible refuge for human destitution. I think I</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot the Selenites, the mooncalves, the lid, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noises completely so soon as I had eaten that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cavor replied to my third repetition of my "sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plus population" remark with similar words of ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proval. I felt that my head swam, but I put this</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the stimulating effect of food after a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. "Ess'lent discov'ry yours, Cavor," said I.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Se'nd on'y to the 'tato."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whajer mean ?" asked Cavor. " 'Scovery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon--se'nd on'y to the 'tato?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at him, shocked at his suddenly hoarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, and by the badness of his articulation. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to me in a flash that he was intoxicated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly by the fungus. It also occurred to me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he erred in imagining that he had discovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon; he had not discovered it, he had only reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I tried to lay my hand on his arm and explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">this to him, but the issue was too subtle for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. It was also unexpectedly difficult to express.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a momentary attempt to understand me--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember wondering if the fungus had made my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes as fishy as his--he set off upon some observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions on his own account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are," he announced with a solemn hiccup,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"the creashurs o' what we eat and drink."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He repeated this, and as I was now in one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtle moods, I determined to dispute it. Possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wandered a little from the point. But Cavor</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly did not attend at all properly.

I felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was necessary to clear up this confusion between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon and a potato at once--I wandered into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long parenthesis on the importance of precision of</seg><seg type="columnLine">definition in argument.

What</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Selenites made of this amazing, and to my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">undignified irruption from another planet, I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no means of guessing.

For a long time I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand where I was, nor how I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to this perplexity. I thought of the cupboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">into which I had been thrust at times when I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">child, and then of a very dark and noisy bedroom in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had slept during an illness. But these</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds about me were not the noises I had known,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was a thin flavour in the air like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind of a stable. Then I supposed we must still be</seg><seg type="columnLine">at work upon the sphere, and that somehow I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">got into the cellar of Cavor's house. I remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had finished the sphere, and fancied I must still</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in it and travelling through space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cavor," I said, "cannot we have some light?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came no answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cavor!"

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard him say; "my head!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I attempted to press my hands to my brow, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">ached, and discovered they were tied together. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled me very much. I brought them up to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and felt the cold smoothness of metal. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were chained together. I tried to separate my legs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made out they were similarly fastened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">also that I was fastened to the ground by a much</seg><seg type="columnLine">thicker chain about the middle of my body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was more frightened than I had yet been by</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything in all our strange experience. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I tugged silently at my bonds. "Cavor!" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried out sharply. "Why am I tied? Why have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you tied me hand and xoot?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I haven't tied you," he answered. "It's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Selenites."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Selenites! My mind hung on that for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. Then my memories came back to me: the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snowy desolation, the thawing of the air, the growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plants, our strange hopping and crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the rocks and vegetation of the crater. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distress of our frantic search for the sphere re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to me. . . .

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried; "I wish you'd stop that buzzing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We lapsed into silence again, listening to the dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion of noises like the muffled sounds of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">street or factory that filled our ears. I could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of it, my mind pursued first one rhythm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then another, and questioned it in vain. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a long time I became aware of a new and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharper element, not mingling with the rest but</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing out, as it were, against that cloudy back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground of sound. It was a series of relatively very</seg><seg type="columnLine">little definite sounds, tappings and rubbings, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loose spray of ivy against a window or a bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving about upon a box. We listened and peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us, but the darkness was a velvet pall. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed a noise like the subtle movement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards of a well-oiled lock. And then there appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me, hanging as it seemed in an immensity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of black, a thin bright line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" whispered Cavor very softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thin bright line became a band, and broader</seg><seg type="columnLine">and paler. It took upon itself the quality of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish light falling upon a white-washed wall. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to be parallel-sided; it developed a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">indentation on one side. I turned to remark this</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Cavor, and was amazed to see his ear in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant illumination--all the rest of him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow. I twisted my head round as well as my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds would permit. "Cavor," I said, "it's behind!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">His ear vanished--gave place to an eye!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_ Suddenly the crack that had been admitting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light broadened out, and revealed itself as the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an opening door. Beyond was a sapphire vista,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the doorway stood a grotesque outline</seg><seg type="columnLine">silhouetted against the glare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We both made convulsive efforts to turn, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">failing, sat staring over our shoulders at this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My first impression was of some clumsy quadruped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with lowered head. Then I perceived it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender, pinched body and short and extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">attenuated bandy legs of a Selenite, with his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">depressed between his shoulders. He was without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helmet and body covering they wear when upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exterior of the satellite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a blank, black figure to us, but instinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively our imaginations supplied features to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">very human outline. I, at least, took it instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was somewhat hunchbacked, with a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead and long features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came forward three steps and paused for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. His movements seemed absolutely noiseless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">924</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he came forward again. He walked like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird, his feet fell one in front of the other. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out of the ray of light that came through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway and it seemed as though he vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether in the shadow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment my eyes sought him in the wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, and then I perceived him standing facing us</seg><seg type="columnLine">both in the full light. Only the human features I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had attributed to him were not there at all!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course I ought to have expected that, only I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't. It came to me as an absolute, for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">an overwhelming shock. It seemed as though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't a face, as though it must needs be a mask,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a horror, a deformity, that would presently be dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">avowed or explained. There was no nose, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had dull bulging eyes at the side--in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silhouette I had supposed they were ears. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no ears. ... I have tried to draw one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads, but I cannot. There was a mouth, down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly curved, like a human mouth in a face that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stares ferociously. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The neck on which the head was poised was</seg><seg type="columnLine">jointed in three places, almost like the short joints</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the leg of a crab. The joints of the limbs I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not see, because of the puttee-like straps in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were swathed, and which formed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only clothing the being wore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There the thing was, looking at us!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the time my mind was taken up by the mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossibility of the creature. I suppose he also</seg><seg type="columnLine">was amazed, and with more reason, perhaps, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement than we. Only, confound him! he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not show jt. We did at least know what had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this meeting of incompatible creatures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But conceive how it would seem to decent Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doners, for example, to come upon a couple of liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing things, as big as men and absolutely unlike any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other earthly animals, careering about among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep in Hyde Park!

We were bound hand and foot, fag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ged and filthy; our beards two inches long, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces scratched and bloody. Cavor you must imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his knickerbockers (torn in several places by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bayonet scrub), his Jaeger shirt and old cricket</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap, his wiry hair wildly disordered, a tail to every</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of the heavens. In that blue light his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face did not look red but very dark, his lips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drying blood upon my hands seemed black.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If possible I was in a worse plight than he, on ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of the yellow fungus into which I had jumped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our jackets were unbuttoned, and our shoes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been taken off and lay at our feet.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness had given place to that bluish light again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door was opening, and several noiseless Sele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nites were coming into the chamber.

I perceived that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost and second carried bowls. One elemental</seg><seg type="columnLine">need at least our minds could understand in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon. They were bowls of some metal that, like our</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetters, looked dark in that bluish light; and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained a number of whitish fragments. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloudy pain and misery that oppressed me rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">together and took the shape of hunger. I eyed these</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowls wolfishly, and, though it returned to me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams, at that time it seemed a small matter that</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end of the arms that lowered one towards me</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not hands, but a sort of flap and thumb, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of an elephant's trunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stuff in the bowl was loose in texture, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitish brown in colour--rather like lumps of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold souffle, and it smelt faintly like mushrooms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From a partially divided carcass of a mooncalf that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we presently saw, I am inclined to believe it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been mooncalf flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My hands were so tightly chained that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely contrive to reach the bowl; but when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the effort I made, two of them dexterously</seg><seg type="columnLine">released one of the turns about my wrist. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacle hands were soft and cold to my skin. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately seized a mouthful of the food. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the same laxness in texture that all organic</seg><seg type="columnLine">structures seem to have upon the moon; it tasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather like a gauffer or a damp meringue, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no way was it disagreeable. I took two other</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mouthfuls. "I wanted--foo'!" said I, tearing off</seg><seg type="columnLine">a still larger piece. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time we ate with an utter absence of self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness. We ate and presently drank like</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramps in a soup kitchen. Never before nor since</seg><seg type="columnLine">have I been hungry to the ravenous pitch, and save</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I have had this very experience I could never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have believed that, a quarter of a million of miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of our proper world, in utter perplexity of soul,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded, watched, touched by beings more</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque and inhuman than the worst creations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a nightmare, it would be possible for me to eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in utter forgetfulness of all these things. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood about us watching us, and ever and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a slight elusive twittering that stood them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose, in the stead of speech. I did not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiver at their touch. And when the first zeal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feeding was over, I could note that Cavor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, had been eating with the same shameless</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Experiments in Intercourse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN at last we had made an end of eating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Selenites linked our hands closely to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether again, and then untwisted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains about our feet and rebound them, so as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give us a limited freedom of movement. Then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfastened the chains about our waists. To do all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this they had to handle us freely, and ever and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of their queer heads came down close to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, or a soft tentacle-hand touched my head or</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck. I don't remember that I was afraid then or</seg><seg type="columnLine">repelled by their proximity. I think that our in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curable anthropomorphism made us imagine there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were human heads inside their masks. The skin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like everything else, looked bluish, but that was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of the light; and it was hard and shiny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite in the beetle-wing fashion, not soft, or moist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or hairy, as a vertebrated animal's would be. Along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crest of the head was a low ridge of whitish</seg><seg type="columnLine">spines running from back to front, and a much</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger ridge curved on either side over the eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Selenite who untied me used his mouth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They seem to be releasing us," said Cavor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Remember we are on the moon! Make no sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you going to try that geometry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I get a chance.

I say seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, because as their eyes were at the side and not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front, one had the same difficulty in determining</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction in which they were looking as one has</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the case of a hen or a fish. They conversed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another in their reedy tones, that seemed to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to imitate or define. The door behind us</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened wider, and, glancing over my shoulder, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a vague, large space beyond, in which quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little crowd of Selenites were standing. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a curiously miscellaneous rabble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">927</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do they want us to imitate those sounds?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Cavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I don't think so," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems to me that they are trying to make us</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't make anything of their gestures. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you notice this one, who is worrying with his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a man with an uncomfortable collar?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us shake our heads at him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We did that, and finding it ineffectual, attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">an imitation of the Selenites' movements. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to interest them. At any rate they all set</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the same movement. But as that seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead to nothing, we desisted at last and so did they,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fell into a piping argument among themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then one of them, shorter and very much thicker</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the others, and with a particularly wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, squatted down suddenly beside Cavor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put his hands and feet in the same posture as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor's were bound, and then by a dexterous move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment stood up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cavor," I shouted, "they want us to get up!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stared open-mouthed. "That's it!" he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And with much heaving and grunting, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hands were tied together, we contrived to</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle to our feet. The Selenites made way for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our elephantine heavings, and seemed to twitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">more volubly. As soon as we were on our feet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick-set Selenite came and patted each of our faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his tentacles, and walked towards the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway. That also was plain enough, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed him. We saw that four of the Selenites</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in the doorway were much taller than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, and clothed in the same manner as those</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had seen in the crater, namely, with spiked</seg><seg type="columnLine">round helmets and cylindrical body-cases, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of the four carried a goad with spike and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard made of that same dull-looking metal as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowls. These four closed about us, one on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of each of us, as we emerged from our chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cavern from which the light had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We did not get our impression of that cavern all</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. Our attention was taken up by the move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and attitudes of the Selenites immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us, and by the necessity of controlling our</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion, lest we should startle and alarm them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves by some excessive stride. In front of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the short, thick-set being who had solved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem of asking us to get up, moving with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestures that seemed, almost all of them, intelligible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us, inviting us to follow him. His spout-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">face turned from one of us to the other with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickness that was clearly interrogative. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, I say, we were taken up with these things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at last the great place that formed a back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground to our movements asserted itself. It be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came apparent that the source of much, at least, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tumult of sounds which had filled our ears ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">since we had recovered from the stupefaction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fungus was a vast mass of machinery in active</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement, whose flying and whirling parts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible indistinctly over the heads and between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies of the Selenites who walked about us. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only did the web of sounds that filled the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceed from this mechanism, but also the peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue light that irradiated the whole place. We had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">taken it as a natural thing that a subterranean</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern should be artificially lit, and even now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the fact was patent to my eyes, I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">really grasp its import until presently the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. The meaning and structure of this huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus we saw I cannot explain, because we</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither of us learnt what it was for or how it</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked. One after another, big shafts of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung out and up from its centre, their heads travel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling in what seemed to me to be a parabolic path;</seg><seg type="columnLine">each dropped a sort of dangling arm as it rose to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the apex of its flight and plunged down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vertical cylinder, forcing this down before it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About it moved the shapes of tenders, little figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed vaguely different from the beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us. As each of the three dangling arms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine plunged down, there was a clank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a roaring, and out of the top of the vertical</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder came pouring this incandescent substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lit the place, and ran over as milk runs over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boiling pot, and dripped luminously into a tank of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light below. It was a cold blue light, a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">phosphorescent glow but infinitely brighter, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tanks into which it fell it ran in conduits</seg><seg type="columnLine">athwart the cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thud, thud, thud, thud, came the sweeping arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this unintelligible apparatus, and the light sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance hissed and poured. At first the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed only reasonably large and near to us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I saw how exceedingly little the Selenites upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed, and I realized the full immensity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern and machine. I looked from this tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair to the faces of the Selenites with a new re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spect. I stopped, and Cavor stopped, and stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this thunderous engine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But this is stupendous!" I said. "What can</seg><seg type="columnLine">it be for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cavor's blue-lit face was full of an intelligent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">respect. "I can't dream! Surely these beings-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Men could not make a thing like that! Look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">those arms, are they on connecting rods?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thick-set Selenite had gone some paces un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heeded. He came back and stood between us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great machine. I avoided seeing him, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">I guessed somehow that his idea was to beckon</seg><seg type="columnLine">us onward. He walked away in the direction he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished us to go, and turned and came back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicked our faces to attract our attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cavor and I looked at one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cannot we show him we are interested in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine?" I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Cavor. "We'll try that." He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our guide and smiled, and pointed to the machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointed again, and then to his head, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the machine. By some defect of reasoning he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to imagine that broken English might help</seg><seg type="columnLine">these gestures. "Me look 'im," he said, "me think</seg><seg type="columnLine">'im very much. Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His behaviour seemed to check the Selenites in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their desire for our progress for a moment. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced one another, their queer heads moved, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twittering voices came quick and liquid. Then one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, a lean, tall creature, with a sort of mantle</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to the puttee in which the others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed, twisted his elephant trunk of a hand about</seg><seg type="columnLine">928</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor's waist, and pulled him gently to follow our</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide, who again went on ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cavor resisted. "We may just as well begin ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaining ourselves now. They may think we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">new animals, a new sort of mooncalf perhaps!

I suggested, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Selenites conferred again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Possibly a parabolic-" he began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He yelled loudly, and leaped six feet or more!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the four armed moon-men had pricked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a goad!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned on the goad-bearer behind me with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift threatening gesture, and he started back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This and Cavor's sudden shout and leap clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished all the Selenites. They receded hastily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing us. For one of those moments that seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to last for ever, we stood in angry protest, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered semicircle of these inhuman beings about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He pricked me!" said Cavor, with a catching</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw him," I answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound it!"

What on earth do you take</seg><seg type="columnLine">us for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced quickly right and left. Far away across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue wilderness of cavern I saw a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other Selenites running towards us; broad and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender they were, and one with a larger head than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others. The cavern spread wide and low, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">receded in every direction into darkness. Its roof,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I remember, seemed to bulge down as if with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of the vast thickness of rocks that prisoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. There was no way out of it--no way out of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Above, below, in every direction, was the unknown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and these inhuman creatures, with goads and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestures, confronting us, and we two unsupported</seg><seg type="columnLine">men!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Giddy Bridge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUST for a moment that hostile pause endured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I suppose that both we and the Selenites did</seg><seg type="columnLine">some very rapid thinking. My clearest impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion was that there was nothing to put my back</seg><seg type="columnLine">against, and that we were bound to be surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and killed. The overwhelming folly of our presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">there loomed over me in black, enormous reproach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why had I ever launched myself on this mad, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human expedition?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cavor came to my side and laid his hand on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. His pale and terrified face was ghastly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can't do anything," he said. "It's a mistake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They don't understand. We must go.

My</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> blood was boiling. I noted nothing more of that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cavern, though it seemed to take a long time before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> we had marched across it, or if I noted anything I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> forgot it as I saw it. My thoughts were concen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> trated, I think, upon my chains and the Selenites,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and particularly upon the helmeted ones with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> goads. At first they marched parallel with us, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at a respectful distance, but presently they were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> overtaken by three others, and then they drew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> nearer, until they were within arm's length again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I winced like a beaten horse as they came near to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> us. The shorter, thicker Selenite marched at first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> on our right flank, but presently came in front of us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   How well the picture of that grouping has bitten</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> into my brain; the back of Cavor's downcast head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> just in front of me, and the dejected droop of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> shoulders, and our guide's gaping visage, per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> petually jerking about him, and the goad-bearers on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> either side, watchful, yet open-mouthed--a blue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> monochrome. And after all, I do remember one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> - other thing besides the purely personal affair, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> is, that a sort of gutter came presently across the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> floor of the cavern, and then ran along by the side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of the path of rock we followed. And it was full of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that same bright blue luminous stuff that flowed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> out of the great machine. I walked close beside</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it, and I can testify it radiated not a particle of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> heat. It was brightly shining, and yet it was neither</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> warmer nor colder than anything else in the cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Clang, clang, clang, we passed right under the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> thumping levers of another vast machine, and so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> came at last to a wide tunnel, in which we could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> even hear the pad, pad, of our shoeless feet, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> which, save for the trickling thread of blue to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> right of us, was quite unlit. The shadows made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> gigantic travesties of our shapes and those of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Selenites on the irregular wall and roof of the tun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> nel. Ever and again crystals in the walls of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tunnel scintillated like gems, ever and again the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tunnel expanded into a stalactitic cavern, or gave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> off branches that vanished into darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   We seemed to be marching down that tunnel for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a long time. "Trickle, trickle," went the flowing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> light very softly, and our footfalls and their echoes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> made an irregular paddle, paddle. My mind settled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> down to the question of my chains. If I were to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> slip off one turn so, and then to .twist it so .. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   If I tried to do it very gradually, would they see</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was slipping my wrist out of the looser turn?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If they did, what would they do?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Bedford," said Cavor, "It goes down.

The unanticipated things!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went on to speculate on the possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their knowing things he had never hoped to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth, speculating in that way, with a raw wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that goad already in his skin! Much that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said I forget, for my attention was drawn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that the tunnel along which we had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">marching was opening out wider and wider. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, from the feeling of the air, to be going out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a huge space. But how big the space might</seg><seg type="columnLine">really be we could not tell, because it was unlit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our little stream of light ran in a dwindling thread</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vanished far ahead. Presently the rocky walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">had vanished altogether on either hand. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to be seen but the path in front of us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trickling hurrying rivulet of blue phosphores-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cence. The figures of Cavor and the guiding Sele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nite marched before me, the sides of their leg3</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heads that were towards the rivulet were clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bright blue, their darkened sides, now that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflection of the tunnel wall no longer lit them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">merged indistinguishably in the darkness beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And soon I perceived that we were approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">a declivity of some sort, because the little blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream dipped suddenly out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment, as it seemed, we had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge. The shining stream gave one meander of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitation and then rushed over. It fell to a depth</seg><seg type="columnLine">at which the sound of its descent was absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost to us. Far below was a bluish glow, a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blue mist--at an infinite distance below. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness the stream dropped out of became</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly void and black, save that a thing like a plank</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected from the edge of the cliff and stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and faded and vanished altogether. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a warm air blowing up out of the gulf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment I and Cavor stood as near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge as we dared, peering into a blue-tinged pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fundity.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he perceived we watched him, he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and went on along it, walking as surely as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he was on firm earth. For a moment his</seg><seg type="columnLine">form was distinct, then he became a blue blur, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then vanished into the obscurity. I became aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some vague shape looming darkly out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a pause. "Surely-----!" said Cavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the other Selenites walked a few paces</seg><seg type="columnLine">out upon the plank, and turned and looked back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">us unconcernedly.

Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">here it was that our resemblances were not going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge our differences.

I slipped my wrist very quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the coil of chain that was loose, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to twist my wrists in opposite directions.

For one of the armed Selenites had stabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me behind with his goad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wrenched my wrists free from the little tentacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">that held them. I turned on the goad-bearer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Confound you!" I cried. "I've warned you of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. What on earth do you think I'm made of,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stick that into me? If you touch me again--i--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">By way of answer he pricked me forthwith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard Cavor's voice in alarm and entreaty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even then I think he wanted to compromise with</seg><seg type="columnLine">these creatures. "I say, Bedford," he cried, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know a way!" But the sting of that second stab</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to set free some pent-up reserve of energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my being. Instantly the link of the wrist-chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped, and with it snapped all considerations</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had held us unresisting in the hands of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon creatures. For that second, at least, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad with fear and anger. I took no thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequences. I hit straight out at the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing with the goad. The chain was twisted round</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fist. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came another of these beastly surprises</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which the moon world is full.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My mailed hand seemed to go clean through him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He smashed like--like some softish sort of sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with liquid in it! He broke right in! He squelched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and splashed. It was like hitting a damp toadstool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The flimsy body went spinning a dozen yards, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell with a flabby impact. I was astonished. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was incredulous that any living thing could be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">flimsy. For an instant I could have believed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thing a dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it had become real and imminent again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither Cavor nor the other Selenites seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done anything from the time when I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned about to the time when the dead Selenite</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit the ground. Every one stood back from us two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one alert. That arrest seemed to last at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least a second after the Selenite was down. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one must have been taking the thing in. I seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remember myself standing with my arm half</seg><seg type="columnLine">retracted, trying also to take it in. "What next?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamoured my brain; "what next?" Then in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment every one was moving!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I perceived we must get our chains loose, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that before we could do this these Selenites had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be beaten off. I faced towards the group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three goad-bearers. Instantly one threw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">goad at me. It swished over my head, and I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose went flying into the abyss behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I leaped right at him with all my might as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">goad flew over me. He turned to run as I jumped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I bore him to the ground, came down right</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him, and slipped upon his smashed body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell. He seemed to wriggle under my foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I came into a sitting position, and on every hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue backs of the Selenites were receding into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness. I bent a link by main force and</seg><seg type="columnLine">untwisted the chain that had hampered me about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ankles, and sprang to my feet, with the chain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand. Another goad, flung javelin-wise, whistled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by me, and I made a rush towards the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of which it had come. Then I turned back</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards Cavor, who was still standing in the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rivulet near the gulf convulsively busy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wrists, and at the same time jabbering nonsense</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" I cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My hands!" he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, realising that I dared not run back to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because my ill-calculated steps might carry me</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the edge, he came shuffling towards me, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands held out before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gripped his chains at once to unfasten them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are they?" he panted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Run away. They'll come back. They're throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing things! Which way shall we go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the light. To that tunnel. Eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said I, and his hands were free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I dropped on my knees and fell to work on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankle bonds. Whack came something--I know not</seg><seg type="columnLine">what--and splashed the livid streamlet into drops</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us. Far away on our right a piping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I whipped the chain off his feet, and put it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. "Hit with that!" I said, and without</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for an answer, set off in big bounds along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path by which we had come. I had a nasty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of feeling that these things could jump out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness on to my back. I heard the impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his leaps come following after me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We ran in vast strides. But that running, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must understand, was an altogether different thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from any running on earth. On earth one leaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost instantly hits the ground again, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the moon, because of its weaker pull, one shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air for several seconds before one came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth. In spite of our violent hurry this gave an</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">931</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of long pauses, pauses in which one might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have counted seven or eight. "Step," and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">soared off! All sorts of questions ran through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind: "Where are the Selenites? What will they</seg><seg type="columnLine">do? Shall we ever get to that tunnel? Is Cavor</seg><seg type="columnLine">far behind? Are they likely to cut him off?" Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">whack, stride, and off again for another step.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw a Selenite running in front of me, his legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">going exactly as a man's would go on earth, saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him glance over his shoulder, and heard him shriek</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he ran aside out of my way into the darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was, I think, our guide, but I am not sure. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">in another vast stride the walls of rock had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view on either hand, and in two more strides</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was in the tunnel, and tempering my pace to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">low roof. I went on to a bend, then stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned back, and plug, plug, plug, Cavor came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">view, splashing into the stream of blue light at</seg><seg type="columnLine">every stride, and grew larger and blundered into</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. We stood clutching each other. For a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least, we had shaken off our captors and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were both very much out of breath. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in panting, broken sentences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've spoilt it all!" panted Cavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nonsense," I cried. "It was that or death!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are we to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can we?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's dark enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up one of these side caverns."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right--come on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We strode on, and presently came to a radiating</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark cavern. Cavor was in front. He hesitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chose a black mouth that seemed to promise</seg><seg type="columnLine">good hiding. He went towards it and turned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's dark," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your legs and feet will light us. You're wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that luminous stuff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tumult of sounds, and in particular a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a clanging gong, advancing up the main tunnel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">became audible. It was horribly suggestive of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumultuous pursuit. We made a bolt for the unlit</seg><seg type="columnLine">side cavern forthwith. As we ran along it our way</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lit by the irradiation of Cavor's legs. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky," I panted, "they took off our boots, or we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should fill this place with clatter." On we rushed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking as small steps as we could to avoid striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof of the cavern. After a time we seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be gaining on the uproar. It became muffled, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwindled, it died away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stopped and looked back, and I heard the pad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pad of Cavor's feet receding. Then he stopped also.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bedford," he whispered; "there's a sort of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked, and at first could see nothing. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived his head and shoulders dimly outlined</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a fainter darkness. I saw, also, that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitigation of the darkness was not blue, as all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other light within the moon had been, but a pallid</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray, a very vague, faint white, the daylight colour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor noted this difference as soon, or sooner, than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I did, and I think too, that it filled him with much</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same wild hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bedford," he whispered, and his voice trembled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"That light--it is possible-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not dare to say the thing he hoped. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a pause. Suddenly I knew by the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet that he was striding towards that pallor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I followed him with a beating heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHHAPTER XVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Points of View</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE light grew stronger as we advanced. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little time it was nearly as strong as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phosphorescence on Cavor's legs. Our tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was expanding into a cavern, and this new light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at the farther end of it. I perceived something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that set my hopes leaping and bounding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cavor," I said, "it comes from above! I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain it comes from above!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made no answer, but hurried on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indisputably it was a gray light, a silvery light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In another moment we were beneath it.. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">filtered down through a chink in the walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern, and as I stared up, drip, came a drop of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water upon my face. I started and stood aside--</seg><seg type="columnLine">drip, fell another drop quite audibly on the rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cavor," I said, "if one of us lifts the other, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can reach that crack!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll lift you," he said, and incontinently hoisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as though I was a baby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thrust an arm into the crack, and just at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger tips found a little ledge by which I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold. I could see the white light was very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter now. I pulled myself up by two fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">with scarcely an effort, though on earth I weigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve stone, reached to a still higher corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, and so got my feet on the narrow ledge. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up and searched up the rocks with my fingers;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cleft broadened out upwardly. "It's climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able," I said to Cavor. "Can you jump up to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand if I hold it down to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wedged myself between the sides of the cleft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested knee and foot on the ledge, and extended a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. I could not see Cavor, but I could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustle of his movements as he crouched to spring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then whack and he was hanging to my arm--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no heavier than a kitten! I lugged him up until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had a hand on my ledge, and could release me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Confound it!" I said, "any one could be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountaineer on the moon;" and so set myself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnest to the climbing. For a few minutes I</seg><seg type="columnLine">clambered steadily, and then I looked up again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cleft opened out steadily, and the light was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter. Only-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not daylight after all!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment I could see what it was, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sight I could have beaten my head against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks with disappointment. For I beheld</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply an irregularly sloping open space, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over its slanting floor stood a forest of little club-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped fungi, each shining gloriously with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinkish silvery light. For a moment I stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their soft radiance, then sprang forward and up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward among them. I plucked up half a dozen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">932</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flung them against the rocks, and then sat down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing bitterly, as Cavor's ruddy face came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's phosphorescence again!" I said. "No need</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hurry. Sit down and make yourself at home."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as he spluttered over our disappointment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to lob more of these growths into the cleft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I thought it was daylight," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Daylight!" cried I. "Daybreak, sunset, clouds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and windy skies! Shall we ever see such things</seg><seg type="columnLine">again?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I spoke, a little picture of our world seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rise before me, bright and little and clear, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the background of sqme old Italian picture. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky that changes, and the sea that changes, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills and the green trees and the towns and cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining in the sun. Think of a wet roof at sunset,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor! Think of the windows of a westward</seg><seg type="columnLine">house!" He made no answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here we are burrowing in this beastly w6rld</seg><seg type="columnLine">that isn't a world, with its inky ocean hidden in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some abominable blackness below, and outside that</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrid day and that death stillness of night. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">all those things that are chasing us now, beastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of leather--insect men, that come out of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmare! After all, they're right! What business</seg><seg type="columnLine">have we here smashing them and disturbing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">world! For all we know the whole planet is up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after us already. In a minute we may hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">them whimpering, and their gongs going. What are</seg><seg type="columnLine">we to do? Where are we to go? Here we are as</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable as snakes from Jamrach's loose in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surbiton villa!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was your fault," said Cavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My fault!" I shouted. "Good Lord!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had an idea!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Curse your ideas!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we had refused to budge--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Under these goads?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. They would have carried us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Over that bridge?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly I saw something that struck me even</seg><seg type="columnLine">then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cavor," I said, "these chains are of gold!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was thinking intently, with his hands gripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cheeks. He turned his head slowly and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me, and when I had repeated my words, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted chain about his right hand. "So they are,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "so they are." His face lost its transitory</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest even as he looked. He hesitated for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, then went on with his interrupted medita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I sat for a space puzzling over the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had only just observed this, until I considered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue light in which we had been, and which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken all the colour out of the metal. And from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that discovery I also started upon a train of thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that carried me wide and far. I forgot that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just been asking what business we had in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. Gold-----</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Cavor who spoke first. "It seems to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there are two courses open to us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Either we can attempt to make our way--fight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our way if necessary--out to the exterior again,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and then hunt for our sphere until we find it, or-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the cold of the night comes to kill us, or else-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He paused. "Yes?" I said, though I knew what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was coming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We might attempt once more to establish some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sort of understanding with the minds of the people</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the moon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So far as I'm concerned--it's the first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I doubt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I don't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You see," said Cavor, "I do not think we can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">judge the Selenites by what we have seen of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Their central world, their civilised world will be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">far below in the profounder caverns about their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sea. This region of the crust in which we are is an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">outlying district, a pastoral region. At any rate,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that is my interpretation. These Selenites we have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seen may be only the equivalent of cowboys and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">engine-tenders. Their use of goads--in all proba-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bility mooncalf goads--the lack of imagination they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">show in expecting us to be able to do just what they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">can do, their indisputable brutality, all seem to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">point to something of that sort.

"Good hea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vens, Cavor!" I cried. "But they will'. They'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the fungi I have been pitching down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll-1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't finish my sentence. I turned about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a leap over the fungus tops towards the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the cavity. I saw that the space turned up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and became a draughty cleft again, ascending</seg><seg type="columnLine">to impenetrable darkness. I was about to clamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">up into this, and then with a happy inspiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you doing?" asked Cavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on!" said I, and went back and got two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shining fungi, and putting one into the breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket of my flannel jacket, so that it stuck out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to light our climbing, went back with the other for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cavor. The noise of the Selenites was now so loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it seemed they must be already beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleft. But it might be they would have difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in clambering into it, or might hesitate to ascend</seg><seg type="columnLine">it against our possible resistance. At any rate, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">now had the comforting knowledge of the enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscular superiority our birth in another planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave us. In another minute I was clambering with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic vigour after Cavor's blue-lit heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVII</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Fight in the Cave of the Moon Butchers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I DO not know how far we clambered before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the grating. It may be we ascended</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few hundred feet; but at the time it</seg><seg type="columnLine">934</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to me we might have hauled and jammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hopped and wedged ourselves through a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more of vertical ascent. Whenever I recall that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, there comes into my head the heavy clank of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our golden chains that followed every movement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very soon my knuckles and knees were raw, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had a bruise on one cheek. After a time the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence of our efforts diminished, and our move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments became more deliberate and less painful. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise of the pursuing Selenites had died away al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. It seemed almost as though they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not traced us up the crack after all, in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tell-tale heap of broken fungi, that must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lain beneath it. At times the eleft narrowed so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much that we could scarce squeeze up it; at other</seg><seg type="columnLine">times it expanded into great cavities, studded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">prickly crystals, or thickly beset with dull, shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungoid pimples. Sometimes it twisted spirally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at other times slanted down nearly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizontal direction. Ever and again there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intermittent drip and trickle of water by us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once or twice it seemed to us that small living</seg><seg type="columnLine">things had rustled out of- our reach, but what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were we never saw. They may have been venomous</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts for all I know, but they did us no harm, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were now tuned to a pitch when a weird creep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thing more or less mattered little. And at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">far above, came the familiar bluish light again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then we saw that it filtered through a grating</seg><seg type="columnLine">that barred our way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We whispered as we pointed this out to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, and became more and more cautious in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our ascent. Presently we were close under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating, and by pressing my face against its bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see a limited portion of the cavern beyond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was clearly a large space, and lit no doubt by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some rivulet of the same blue light that we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen flow from the beating machinery. An inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittent trickle of water dropped ever and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the bars near my face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My first endeavour was naturally to see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be upon the floor of the cavern, but our</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating lay in a depression whose rim hid all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our eyes. Our foiled attention then fell back</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the suggestion of the various sounds we heard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently my eye caught a number of faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows that played across the dim roof far over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indisputably there were several Selenites, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps a considerable number, in this space, for we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the noises of their intercourse, and faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds that I identified as their footfalls. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also a succession of regularly repeated sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">--chid, chid, chid--which began and ceased, sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestive of a knife or spade hacking at some soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance. Then came a clank as if of chains, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle and a rumble as of a truck running over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollowed place, and then again that chid, chid, chid</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed. The shadows told of shapes that moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly and rhythmically, in agreement with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular sound, and rested when it ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We put our heads close together, and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discuss these things in noiseless whispers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are occupied," I said, "they are occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "They're not seeking us, or thinking about us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Perhaps they have not heard of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those others are hunting about below. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suddenly we appeared here-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We looked at one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There might be a chance to parley," said Cavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No," I said. "Not as we are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a space we remained, each occupied by his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">own thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Chid, chid, chid went the chopping, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shadows moved to and fro.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I	looked at the grating. "It's flimsy," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"We might bend two of the bars and crawl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We wasted a little time in vague discussion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">_\Then I took one of the bars in both hands, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">got my feet up against the rock until they were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">almost on a level with my head, and so thrust</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against the bar. It bent so suddenly that I almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slipped. I clambered about and bent the adjacent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bar in the opposite direction, and then took the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">luminous fungus from my pocket and dropped it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down the fissure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Don't do anything hastily," whispered Cavor,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as I twisted myself up through the opening I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enlarged. I had a glimpse of busy figures as I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came through the grating, and immediately bent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down, so that the rim of the depression in which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the grating lay hid me from their eyes, and so lay</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flat, signalling advice to Cavor as he also prepared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to come through. Presently we were side by side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the depression, peering over the edge at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cavern and its occupants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a much larger cavern than we had sup-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">posed from our first glimpse of it, and we looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up from the lowest portion of its sloping floor. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">widened out as it receded from us, and its roof</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came down and hid the remoter portion altogether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And lying in a line along its length, vanishing at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">last far away in that tremendous perspective, were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a number of huge shapes, huge pallid hulls, upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which the Selenites were busy. At first they seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">big white cylinders of vague import. Then I noted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the heads upon them lying towards us, eyeless and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">skinless like the heads of sheep at a butcher's, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perceived they were the carcasses of mooncalves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">being cut up, much as the crew of a whaler might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cut up a moored whale. They were cutting off the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flesh in strips, and on some of the farther trunks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the white ribs were showing. It was the sound of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their hatchets that made that chid, chid. Some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">distance away a thing like a trolley cable, drawn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and loaded with chunks of lax meat, was running</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up the slope of the cavern floor. This enormous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long avenue of hulls that were destined to be food,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gave us a sense of the vast populousness of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moon-world second only to the effect of our first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">glimpse down the shaft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It seemed to me at first that the Selenites must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be standing on trestle-supported planks,1 and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I saw that the planks and supports and their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hatchets were really of the same leaden hue as my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   II	do not remember seeing any wooden things on the moon; doors,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tables, everything corresponding to our terrestrial joinery was made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of metal, and I believe for the most part of gold, which as a metal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> would, of course, naturally recommend itself--other^ things being equal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> --on account of the case ia working it, and its toughness and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> durability.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">935</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fetters bad seemed before white light came to bear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on them. A number of very thick-looking crow-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bars lay about the floor, and had apparently assisted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to turn the dead mooncalf over on its side. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were perhaps six feet long, with shaped handles,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very tempting-looking weapons.

In a little while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not doubt that something was quietly ascend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the cleft. Very slowly and quite noiselessly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured myself of a good grip on my chain, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for that something to appear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Just look at those chaps with the hatchets again,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're all right," said Cavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took a sort of provisional aim at the gap in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating. I could hear now quite distinctly the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">twittering of the ascending Selenites, the dab of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hands against the rocks, and the falling of dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their grips as they clambered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I could see that there was something mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dimly in the blackness below the grating, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it might be I could not distinguish. The whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing seemed to hang fire just for a moment--then</seg><seg type="columnLine">smash! I had sprung to my feet, struck savagely</seg><seg type="columnLine">at something that had flashed out at me. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the keen point of a spear. I have thought since</seg><seg type="columnLine">that its length in the narrowness of the cleft must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have prevented its being sloped to reach me. Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, it shot out from the grating like the tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a snake, and missed and flew back and flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. But the second time I snatched and caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and wrenched it away, but not before another</seg><seg type="columnLine">had darted ineffectually at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shouted with triumph as I felt the hold of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Selenite resist my pull for a moment and give, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then I was jabbing down through the bars, amidst</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeals from the darkness, and Cavor had snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the other spear, and was leaping and flourishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it beside me, and making inefficient jabs. Clang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clang, came up through the grating, and then an</seg><seg type="columnLine">axe hurtled through the air and whacked against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks beyond, to remind me of the fleshers at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carcasses up the cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned, and they were all coming towards us</seg><seg type="columnLine">in open order waving their axes. They were short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick, little beggars, with long arms, strikingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from the ones we had seen before. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not heard of us before, they must have realised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation with incredible swiftness. I stared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at them for a moment, spear in hand. "Guard that</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating, Cavor," I cried, howled to intimidate them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rushed to meet them. Two of them missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their hatchets, and the rest fled incontinently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the two also were sprinting away up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern, with hands clenched and heads down. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never saw men run like them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew the spear I had was no good for me. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thin and flimsy, only effectual for a thrust, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">too long for a quick recover. So I only chased</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Selenites as far as the first carcass, and stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and picked up one of the crowbars that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying about. It felt comfortingly heavy, and equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to smashing any number of Selenites. I threw away</seg><seg type="columnLine">my spear, and picked up a second crowbar for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other hand. I felt five times better than I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the spear. I shook the two threateningly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Selenites, who had come to a halt in a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd far away up the cavern, and then turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to look at Cavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was leaping from side to side of the grating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making threatening jabs with his broken spear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was all right. It would keep the Selenites</seg><seg type="columnLine">down--for a time at any rate. I looked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern again. What on earth were we going to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">now?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were cornered in a sort of way already. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">these butchers up the cavern had been surprised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were probably scared, and they had no special</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons, only those little hatchets of theirs. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way lay escape. Their sturdy little forms--</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever so much shorter and thicker than the moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">calf herders--were scattered up the slope in a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was eloquent of indecision. I had the moral</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage of a mad bull in a street. But for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, there seemed a tremendous crowd of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very probably there was. Those Selenites down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cleft had certainly some infernally long spears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It might be they had other surprises for us. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, confound it! if we charged up the cave we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should let them up behind us, and if we didn't those</seg><seg type="columnLine">little brutes up the cave would probably get rein-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced. Heaven alone knew what tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines of warfare--'guns, bombs, terrestrial tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedoes--this unknown world below our feet, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaster world of which we had only pricked the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuticle, might not presently send up to our destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. It became clear that the only thing to do was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to charge! It became clearer as the legs of a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of fresh Selenites appeared running down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern towards us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bedford!" cried Cavor, and behold! he was half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way between me and the grating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go back!" I cried. "What are you doing--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They've got--it's like a gun!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And struggling in the grating between those de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fensive spears appeared the head and shoulders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a singularly lean and angular Selenite, bearing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">complicated apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I realised Cavor's utter incapacity for the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had in hand. For a moment I hesitated. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rushed past him whirling my crowbars, and shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to confound the aim of the Selenite. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aiming in the queerest way with the thing against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stomach. "Chxizz!" The thing wasn't a gun;</seg><seg type="columnLine">936</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it went off like a cross-bow more, and dropped me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle of a leap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't fall down, I simply came down a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter than I should have done if I hadn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit, and from the feel of my shoulder the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have tapped me and glanced off. Then my</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand hit the shaft again and I perceived there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sort of spear sticking half through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. The moment after I got home with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowbar in my right hand, and hit the Selenite fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and square. He collapsed--he crushed and crumpled</seg><seg type="columnLine">--his head smashed like an egg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I dropped a crowbar, pulled the spear out of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, and began to jab it down the grating into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness. At each jab came a shriek and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitter. Finally I hurled the spear down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with all my strength, leapt up, picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowbar again, and started for the multitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bedford!" cried Cavor. "Bedford!" as I flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">past him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I seem to remember his footsteps coming on</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Step, leap . . . whack, step, leap. . . . Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap seemed to last ages. With each, the cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened out and the number of Selenites visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased. At first they seemed all running about</seg><seg type="columnLine">like ants in a disturbed ant-hill, one or two waving</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchets and coming to meet me, more running</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, some bolting sideways into the avenue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">carcasses, then presently others came in sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying spears, and then others. I saw a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary thing, all hands and feet, bolting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover. The cavern grew darker farther up. Flick!</seg><seg type="columnLine">something flew over my head. Flick! As I soared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mid-stride I saw a spear hit and quiver in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carcasses to my left. Then, as I came down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hit the ground before me, and I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remote chuzz! with which their things were fired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flick, flick! for a moment it was a shower. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were volleying!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stopped dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I don't think I thought clearly then. I seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember a kind of stereotyped phrase running</seg><seg type="columnLine">through my mind: "Zone of fire, seek cover!" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I made a dash for the space between two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carcasses, and stood there panting and feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">very wicked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked round for Cavor, and for a moment it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed as if he had vanished from the world. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came out of the darkness between the row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carcasses and the rocky wall of the cavern.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw his little face, dark and blue, and shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">with perspiration and emotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was saying something, but what it was I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not heed. I had realised that we might work from</seg><seg type="columnLine">mooncalf to mooncalf up the cave until we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">near enough to charge home. It was charge or</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. "Come on!" I said, and led the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bedford!" he cried unavailingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My mind was busy as we went up that narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">alley between the dead bodies and the wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern. The rocks curved about--they could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enfilade us. Though in that narrow space we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not leap, yet with our earth-born strength we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still able to go very much faster than the -Selenites.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I reckoned we should presently come right among</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them. Once we were on them, they would be nearly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as formidable as black beetles. Only!--there would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first of all be a volley. I thought of a stratagem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I whipped off my flannel jacket as I ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Bedford!" panted Cavor behind me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I glanced back, "What?" said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was pointing upward over the carcasses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "White light!" he said. "White light again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I looked, and it was even so, a faint white ghost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of twilight in the remoter cavern roof. That seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to give me double strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Keep close," I said. A flat, long Selenite dashed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out of darkness, and squealed and fled. I halted,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and stopped Cavor with my hand. I hung my jacket</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over my crowbar, ducked round the next carcass,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dropped jacket and crowbar, showed myself, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">darted back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chuzz--flick," just one arrow came. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">close on the Selenites, and they were standing in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd, broad, short, and tall together, with a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">battery of their shooting implements pointing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave. Three or four other arrows followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, and then their fire ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I stuck out my head, and escaped by a hair's-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. breadth. This time I drew a dozen shots or more,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and heard the Selenites shouting and twittering as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if with excitement as they shot. I picked up jacket</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and crowbar again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Now!" said I, and thrust out the jacket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Chuzz-zz-zz-zz! Chuzz! In an instant my</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacket had grown a thick beard of arrows, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were quivering all over the carcass behind us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly I slipped the crowbar out of the jacket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped the jacket--for all I know to the contrary</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is lying up there in the moon now--and rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For a minute perhaps it was massacre. I was too</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fierce to discriminate, and the Selenites were prob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ably too scared to fight. At any rate they made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no sort of fight against me. I saw scarlet, as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saying is. I remember I seemed to be wading</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">among those leathery, thin things as a man wades</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through tall grass, mowing and hitting, first right,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then left; smash, smash. Little drops of moisture</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flew about. I trod on things that crushed and piped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and went slippery. The crowd seemed to open and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">close and flow like water. They seemed to have no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">combined plan whatever. Spears flew about me. I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grazed over the ear by one. I was stabbed once in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the arm and once in the cheek, but I only found that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out afterwards, when the blood had had time to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">run and cool and feel wet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What Cavor did I do not know. For a space</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed that this fighting had lasted for an age,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and must needs go on for ever. Then suddenly it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all over, and there was nothing to be seen but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the backs of heads bobbing up and down as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">owners ran in all directions. ... I seemed alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether unhurt. I ran forward some paces, shouting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turned about. I was amazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had come right through them in vast flying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strides, they were all behind me, and running hither</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and thither to hide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I felt an enormous astonishment at the evapora-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion of the great fight into which I had hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST MEN IN THE MOON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">937</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">myself, and not a little of exultation. It did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seem to me that I had discovered the Selenites were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unexpectedly flimsy, but that I was unexpectedly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strong. I laughed stupidly. This fantastic moon!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced for a moment at the smashed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhing bodies that were scattered over the cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, with a vague idea of further violence, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried on after Cavor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Sunlight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PRESENTLY we saw that the cavern before us</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened on a hazy void. In another moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had emerged upon a sort of slanting</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallery, that projected into a vast circular space, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge cylindrical pit running vertically up and down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Round this pit the slanting gallery ran without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any parapet or protection for a turn and a half, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then plunged high above into the rock again. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how it reminded me then of one of those spiral</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns of the railway through the Saint Gothard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all tremendously huge. I can scarcely hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to convey to you the Titanic proportion of all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, the Titanic effect of it. Our eyes followed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vast declivity of the pit wall, and overhead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">far above we beheld a round opening set with faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">Btars, and half of the lip about it well-nigh blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the white light of the sun. At that we cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud simultaneously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" I said, leading the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there?" said Cavor, and very carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped nearer the edge of the gallery. I followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his example, and craned forward and looked down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I was dazzled by that gleam of light above, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see only a bottomless darkness with spectral</seg><seg type="columnLine">patches of crimson and purple floating therein. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I could not see, I could hear. Out of this dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness came a sound, a sound like the angry hum</seg><seg type="columnLine">one can hear if one puts one's ear outside a hive of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bees, a sound out of that enormous hollow, it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, four miles beneath our feet. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment I listened, then tightened my grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my crowbar, and led the way up the gallery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This must be the shaft we looked down upon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Cavor. "Under that lid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"And below there, is where we saw the lights."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The lights!" said he. "Yes--the lights of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world that now we shall never see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll come back," I said, for now we had escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much I was rashly sanguine that we should re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover the sphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His answer I did not catch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eh?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It doesn't matter," he answered, and we hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">on in silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I suppose that slanting lateral way was four or</seg><seg type="columnLine">five miles long, allowing for its curvature, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascended at a slope that would have made it almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossibly steep on earth, but which one strode up</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily under lunar conditions. We saw only two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Selenites during all that portion of our flight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly they became aware of us they ran head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. It was clear that the knowledge of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and violence had reached them. Our way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the exterior was unexpectedly plain. The spiral</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gallery straightened into a steeply ascendent tunnel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its floor bearing abundant traces of the mooncalves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so straight and short in proportion to its vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">arch, that no part of it was absolutely dark. Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately it began to lighten, and then far off</seg><seg type="columnLine">and high up, and quite blindingly brilliant, appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">its opening on the exterior, a slope of Alpine steep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness surmounted by a crest of bayonet shrub, tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broken down now, and dry and dead, in spiky</seg><seg type="columnLine">silhouette against the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it is strange that we men, to whom this very</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetation had seemed so weird and horrible a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little time ago, should now behold it with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion a home-coming exile might feel at sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his native land. We welcomed even the rareness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air that made us pant as we ran, and which</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendered speaking no longer the easy thing that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been, but an effort to make oneself heard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larger grew the sunlit circle above us, and larger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all the nearer tunnel sank into a rim of indis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguishable black. We saw the dead bayonet</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrub no longer with any touch of green in it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown and dry and thick, and the shadow of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper branches high out of sight made a densely</seg><seg type="columnLine">interlaced pattern upon the tumbled rocks. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the immediate mouth of the tunnel was a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">trampled space where the mooncalves had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We came out upon this space at last into a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heat that hit and pressed upon us. We traversed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exposed area painfully, and clambered up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope among the scrub stems, and sat down at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting in a high place beneath the shadow of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of twisted lava.

It's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">getting on my nerves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I have called him on the phone, and have rung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it on and off for twenty minutes; I could hear his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bell through the ventilator, but he pays no attention</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to it. So, a while ago I tried to call on him. Do you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">know him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "I know who he is," I replied, "but do not remem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ber ever having met him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "If you had ever met him you would remember.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He has a queer head.

He is courteous, but seemed afraid of me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We agreed that there was not much that we could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">do about it. I gave up trying to keep my appoint-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment, told Stoner that I was glad I had met him,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and went home. The next morning at seven he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me on the telephone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Are you still interested?" he asked, and his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">voice was nervous. "That bird's been at it all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night. Come and help me talk to the hotel manage-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment." I needed no urging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I found Beesley, the hotel manager, with Stoner;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he was from St. Louis, and looked French.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "He can do it if he wants to," he said, shrugging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> his shoulders comically; "unless you complain of it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as a disturbance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "It isn't that," said Stoner; "there must be some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> thing wrong with the man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Some form of insanity-" I suggested;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "or a compulsion neurosis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "That's what I'll be pretty soon," Stoner said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;„ "He is a queer gink anyway.

His head hung forward on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest with a ghastly limpness. He was a big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-built man, with a vigorous stride. Always it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was -the same path. He avoided the small table in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle each time with exactly the same sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">side step and swing. His head bumped limply as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned near the window and started back across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. For two hours we watched him in shivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascination, during which he walked with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous uniformity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That makes thirty hours of this," said Stoner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wouldn't you say that there was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We tried another consultation with the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager.

He advised us against breaking in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man has a right to walk that way if he wants</seg><seg type="columnLine">to," he said. "Here's this fellow in the papers who</seg><seg type="columnLine">played the piano for 49 hours, and the police didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop him; and in Germany they practice making</seg><seg type="columnLine">public speeches for 18 hours at a stretch.

I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend a little time on my patients, but Stoner and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief stayed, and agreed to call me if occasion</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose. I peeped through the periscope at the walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing man several times during the next twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours; and it was always exactly the same, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging, bumping head, the uniformity of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, the uncanny, machine-like exactitude of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements. I spent an hour at a time with my eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the telescope studying his movements for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">variation, but was unable to be certain of any.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That afternoon I looked up my neurology texts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but found no clues. The next day at 4 o'clock in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon, after not less than 55 hours of it, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there with Stoner to see the end of it; Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter John Smith was out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we watched, we saw that he moved more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more slowly, but with otherwise identical motions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had the effect of the slowed motion pictures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancers or athletes; or it seemed like some curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream; for as we watched, the sound of the steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ventilator also slowed and weakened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we saw him sway a little, and totter, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though his balance were imperfect. He swayed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few times and fell sidewise on the floor; we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see one leg in the field of our periscope moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly with the same movements as in walking, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slow, dizzy sort of motion. In five more minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was quite still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief was up in a few moments in response</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our telephone call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we've got to break in," he said. Beesley</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged his shoulders and said nothing. Stoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the rescue of the hotel property.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A small man could go down this ventilator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This grill can be unscrewed, and the lower one can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be knocked out with a hammer; it is cast-iron."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beesley was gone like a flash, and soon returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one of his window-washers, who was small and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiry, and also a rope and hammer. We took off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grill and held the rope as the man crawled in. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted to us as he hit the bottom. The air drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongly downwards, but the blows of his hammer</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the grill came up to us. We hurried down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs. Not a sound came through the door of 216,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we waited for some minutes. Then there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattle of bars and the door opened, and a gust of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold wind struck us, with a putrid odor that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">us gulp. The man had evidently run to open a</seg><seg type="columnLine">window before coming to the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anstruther lay on his side, with one leg straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other extended forward as in a stride; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was livid, sunken, hideous. Stoner gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glance, and then scouted around the room--look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the machinery he had been hearing, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding none. The chief and I also went over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms, but they were just conventional rooms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather colorless and lacking in personality. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief called an undertaker and also the coroner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arranged for a post-mortem examination. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">received permission to notify a number of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessional colleagues; I wanted some of them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">share in the investigation of this unusual case with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. As I was leaving, I could not help noting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished gasps of the undertaker's assistants as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they lifted the body; but they were apparently too</seg><seg type="columnLine">well trained to say anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That evening, a dozen physicians gathered around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the figure covered with a white sheet on the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center of the undertaker's work room. Stoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there; a writer may be anywhere he chooses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The coroner was preparing to draw back the sheet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The usual medical history is lacking in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">case," he said. "Perhaps an account by Dr. B</seg><seg type="columnLine">or his author friend, of the curious circumtances</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected with the death of this man, may take its</seg><seg type="columnLine">place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can tell a good deal," said Stoner; "and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it will bear directly on what you find when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you open him up, even though it is not technical</seg><seg type="columnLine">medical stuff. Do you care to hear it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell it! Go on! Let's have it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have lived above him in the hotel for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">months," Stoner began. "He struck me as a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">person, and as I do some writing, all mankind is</seg><seg type="columnLine">my legitimate field for study. I tried to find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I could about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has an office in the Little Building, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">did a rather curious business.. He dealt in vases</seg><seg type="columnLine">and statuary, book-ends and chimes, and things you</seg><seg type="columnLine">put around in rooms to make them look artistic. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had men out buying the stuff, and others selling</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, all by personal contact and on a very exclusive</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN WITH THE STRANGE HEAD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">943</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">basis. He kept the stock in a warehouse near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rock Island tracks where they pass the Ball Park;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do not believe that he ever saw any of it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">just sat in the office and signed papers, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fellows made the money; and apparently they</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a lot of it, for he has swung some big financial</seg><seg type="columnLine">deals in this town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I often met him in the lobby or the elevator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a big, vigorous man and walked with an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually graceful step and an appearance of strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vitality. His eyes seemed to light up with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cognition when he saw me, but in my company he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was always formal and reserved. For such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorous looking man, his voice was singularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracked and feeble, and his head gave an impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being rather small for him, and his face old</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrinkled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"He seemed fairly well known about the city. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Eastridge Club they told me that he plays golf</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally and excellently, and is a graceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancer, though somehow not a popular partner. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seen frequently at the Y. M. C. A. bowling</seg><seg type="columnLine">alleys, and played with an uncanny skill. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved to see him bowl for his cleverness with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balls, but wished he were not so formally courteous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did not wear such an expression of complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness over his victories. Bridley, manager of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rudge &amp; Guenzel's book department, was the oldest</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend of his that I could find, and he gave me some</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting information. They went to school to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, and Anstruther was poor in health as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in finances. Twenty-five years ago, during the hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and miserable years after his graduation from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">University, Bridley remembered him as saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'My brain needs a body to work with. If I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical strength, I could do anything. If I find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fellow who can give it to me, I'll make him rich!'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bridley also remembers that he was sensitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">because girls did not like his debilitated physique.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seems to have found health later, though I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">find no one who remembers how or when. About</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten years ago he came back from Europe where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been for several years, in Paris, Bridley</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinks; and for several years after this, a French-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man lived with him. The city directory'of that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">has him living in the big stone house at 13th and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"G" streets. I went up there to look around, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it a double house, Dr. Faubourg having oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied the other half. The present caretaker has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been there ever since Anstruther lived in the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she says that his French companion must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been some sort of an engineer, and that the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been working on an invention, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sounds she heard and the materials they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had about. Some three or four years ago the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman and the machinery vanished, and An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struther moved to the Cornhusker Hotel. Also at</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this time, Dr. Faubourg retired from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice of medicine. He must have been about</seg><seg type="columnLine">50 years old, and too healthy and vigorous to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">retiring on account of old age or ill health.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Apparently Anstruther never married. His pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vate life was quite obscure, but he appeared much</seg><seg type="columnLine">in public. He was always very courtly and polite</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ladies. Outside his business he. took a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in Y. M. C. A. and Boy Scout camps, in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">National Guard, and in fact in everything that stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an outdoor, physical life, and promoted health.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In spite of his oddity he was quite a hero with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small boys, especially since the time of his radium</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold-up. This is intimately connected with the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his radium speculation that caused such a sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation in financial circles a couple of years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About that time, the announcement appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the discovery of new uses for radium; a way had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been found to accelerate its splitting and to derive</seg><seg type="columnLine">power from it. Its price went up, and it promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become a scarce article on the market. Anstruther</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never been known to speculate, nor to tamper</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sensational things like oil and helium; but on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this occasion he seemed to go into a panic. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">cashed in on a lot of securities and caused a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic in the city, as he was quite wealthy and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially large amounts of money in the building-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loan business. The newspapers told of how he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought a hundred thousand dollars worth of radium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was to be delivered right here in Lincoln--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curious method of speculating, the editors volun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It arrived by express one day, and Anstruther</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode the express wagon with the driver to the sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I found the driver and he told the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hold-up at 8th and 'P' streets at eleven</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock at night. A Ford car drove up beside them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which a man pointed a pistol at them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered them to stop. The driver stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Come across with the radium!' shouted the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">black bulk in the Ford, climbing upon the express</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon. Anstruther's fist shot out like a flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning alnd struck the arm holding the pistol; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the driver states that he heard the pistol crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the window on the second floor of the Lin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coln Hotel. Anstruther pushed the express driver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was in his way, backwards over the seat among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the packages and leaped upon the hold-up man;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the driver said he heard Anstruther's muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">crunch savagely, as with little apparent effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">he flung the man over the Ford; he fell with A.</seg><seg type="columnLine">thud on the asphalt and stayed there. Anstruther</seg><seg type="columnLine">then launched a kick at the man at the wheel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ford, who crumpled up and fell out of the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The police found the pistol inside a room on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second floor of the Lincoln Hotel. The steering</seg><seg type="columnLine">post of the Ford car was torn from its fastenings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both of the hold-up men had ribs and collar-bones</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken, and the gunman's forearm was bent double</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle with both bones broken. These two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men agreed later with the express driver that An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struther's attack, for suddenness, swiftness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific strength was beyond anything they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed possible; he was like a thunderbolt; like</seg><seg type="columnLine">some furious demon. When the two men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddled in black heaps on the pavement, Anstruther</seg><seg type="columnLine">said to the driver, quite impersonally:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Drive to the police station; Come on!

They thought of all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">only too seriously and in spite of themselves. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">women especially were overwhelmed by it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did not wish to dwell upon it, and Cosmo Ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sal did not wish that they should.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At night he had musicians play in the grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon; he distributed books among the passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a large library which he had selected; and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last he had the stage set, and invited his friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the players, to entertain the company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he would have no plays but those of Shake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were, probably, not half a dozen persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Ark who had even seen representations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these great dramas, and very few who had read</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, so that they had the advantage of complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">novelty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The play selected for the first representation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tragedy of "King Lear," a strange choice, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would, at first sight, seem, but Cosmo Versal had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deep knowledge of human nature.

It was the principle of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munizing therapeutics, where poison paralyzes</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It turned out as he anticipated.

It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete revelation to them, and they were carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of themselves, and found in the sympathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened by this heart-crushing spectacle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">acme of human woe an unconscious solace for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own moral anguish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward Cosmo put upon the stage "Hamlet,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and "Othello," and "Macbeth," and "Coriolanus,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and "Julius Czesar," but he avoided, for the present,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the less tragic dramas. And all of them, being new</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the hearers, produced an enormous effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On alternate nights he substituted music for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drama, and, as this was confined to the most ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jestic productions of the great masters of the past,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of whose works, like some of Shakespeare's</seg><seg type="columnLine">had long been neglected if not forgotten, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">power over the spirits of the company was, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even more pronounced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo Versal was already beginning the educa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of his chosen band of race regenerators, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he mused upon the wonders that the science of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eugenics would achieve after the world should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">re-emerged from the waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the most singular effects of the music</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that produced upon the insane billionaire, Amos</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blank. He had been confined in the room that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo had assigned to him, and was soothed, when-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever Cosmo could find time to visit him, with pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended acquiescense in his crazed notion that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip of the Ark was part of a scheme to "corner"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resources of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo persuaded him that the secret was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known except to themselves, and that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">essential to success that he (Blank) should remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">in retirement, and accordingly the latter expressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no desire to leave his place of imprisonment, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he regarded as the headquarters of the combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, passing hours in covering sheets of paper with</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns of figures, which he fancied represented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the future profits of the enterprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One night when a symphony of Beethoven was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be played, Cosmo led Amos Blank through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowded saloon and placed him near the musicians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He resisted at first, and when he saw the crowd he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew back, exclaiming:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What? Not overboard yet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Cosmo soothed him with some whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise, and he took his seat, glancing covertly</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him. Then, the instruments struck up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately fixed his attention. As the musical</seg><seg type="columnLine">theme developed his eyes gradually lost their wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">look, and a softened expression took its place. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank lower in his seat, and rested his head upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. His whole soul seemed, at last, to be ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in the music. When it was finished Blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a changed man. Then Cosmo clearly explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him all that had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the first overwhelming effect of his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakening to the realities of his situation had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, the billionaire was fully restored to all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">faculties. Henceforth he mingled with the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers and, as if the change that had come over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spirit had had greater results than the simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">restoration of sanity, he became one of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular and useful members of Cosmo Versal's</seg><seg type="columnLine">family of pilgrims.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                              •</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among the other intellectual diversions which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo provided was something quite unique, due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his own mental bias.

A startled, though incredulous, expression ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared on Cosmo's face, and he sprang to his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but before speaking he obeyed a sign from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain and told Smith to leave the room. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked the door and returned to his table, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dropped into a chair, exclaiming in a guarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great Heaven, can this be possible!

Three of the men threw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain on his back, and pinioned his hands, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could draw a weapon, while Campo and the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang toward Cosmo Versal, Campo pointing a pis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tol at his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all up, Mr. Versal!" cried Campo with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneer. "I'll take command of this ship, and you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">go fish for nebulas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo had one advantage; he was behind his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk, and it was a broad and long one, and placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost against the wall. They could not get at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him without getting round the desk. Campo did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, though he might have shot Cosmo in his tracks;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but evidently he was nourishing the idea of making</seg><seg type="columnLine">him walk the plank. With a sign he commanded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">co-conspirators to flank the desk at each end, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he kept Cosmo covered with his pistol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But with a lightning movement, Cosmo dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the desk, and, favored by his slight form and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his extreme agility, darted like a cat past Campo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, and, almost before the latter could turn round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out of the open door. Campo fired at the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treating form, but the bullet went wide of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark. The pistol was practically noiseless, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound reached no ears in the staterooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It happened that a switch controlling the lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">948</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the gangway was on the wall by Cosmo's door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in passing he swiftly reached up and turned it</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. Thus he was in complete darkness, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Campo darted out of the door he could not see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitive. He could hear his footsteps, however, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with two of his companions he rushed blindly after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, firing two or three shots at random. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo had turned at the first cross passage, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then at the next, this part of the Ark being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">labyrinth of corridors, and the pursuers quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost all trace of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Campo and his companions made their way back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Cosmo's cabin, where their fellows were guard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Captain Arms. They found the switch in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage and turned on the light. They were almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately joined by several other conspirators</seg><seg type="columnLine">conducting Joseph Smith, bound and gagged. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">held a short consultation, and Campo, with many</seg><seg type="columnLine">curses, declared that Cosmo Versal must be caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all hazards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The big-headed fiend!" he cried, gnashing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. "Let me get my grippers on him, and I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">squelch him like a bug!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They threw Joseph Smith into the room beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helpless captain, after taking the latter's pistols,</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked the door from the outside, and hurried off</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their search. In the passages they encountered</seg><seg type="columnLine">several more of their friends. They now numbered</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen, all armed. This may seem a small number</seg><seg type="columnLine">to undertake to capture the Ark; but it must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered that among the thousand-odd inmates,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclusive of the crew, only about one in three was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man, and the majority of these were peaceable</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists who, it was to be presumed, had no fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate, Campo, with the reckless courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his kind, felt confident that if he could get Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Versal, with the captain and Joseph Smith out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way, he could easily overmaster the others. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not much fear of the crew, for he knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were not armed, and he had succeeded in win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning over three of their number, the only ones he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thought at all dangerous, because he had read</seg><seg type="columnLine">their character. More than half the crew were</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed about the engines or on the animal deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most of the others were simply stewards who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not stand before the pistols.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, while the mutineers were hurriedly search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the corridors, Cosmo had run straight to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge, where he found two of his men in charge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whence he sent an electric call to all the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed in the navigation of the vessel. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">came running from various directions, but a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them were caught in the passages by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutineers and bound before they could comprehend</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had happened. Seven, however, succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching the bridge, and among these was Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a mutiny," said Cosmo. "We've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight for our lives. Have you got arms?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not one had a weapon except Waters, who dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">played a pistol half as long as his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, Peterson, take this," said Cosmo, handing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pistol to one of the two mariners who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bridge. "They will be here in a minute. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Campo had been a sailor, he'd have had possession</seg><seg type="columnLine">here the first thing. I'll turn off all lights."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that he pressed a button which put out</seg><seg type="columnLine">every lamp in the Ark. But there was a full moon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they concealed themselves in the shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently they heard the mutineers approaching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbling and cursing in the darkness. Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed Peterson and Waters to place themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side, and told them to fire when he gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next instant four men appeared crossing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlit place at the foot of the steps on the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the dome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait," whispered Cosmo. "The pistols go at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull. We can sweep down a dozen in ten seconds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let them all get in sight first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half a minute later there were twelve men climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the steps and cautiously looking up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire!" cried Cosmo, setting the example, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">three streams of flame poured from the bridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sound of the bullets striking made more noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the explosions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five or six of the men below fell, knocking down</seg><seg type="columnLine">their comrades, and a loud curse burst from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips of Campo, who had a bullet through his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mutineers tumbled in a heap at the bottom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and instantly Cosmo, switching on all lights, led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way down upon them. His men, who had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, seized anything they could get their hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that would serve to strike a blow, and followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conspirators were overwhelmed by the sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denness and fury of the attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four of them were killed outright and five were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded, one so severely that he survived only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo's quick and overwhelming victory was due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fact that the mutineers, in mounting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, could not see him and his men in the shadows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when the automatic weapons, which fired three</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots per second by repeated pressure of the trig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger, from a chamber containing twenty-one car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tridges, once opened on them they could do nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hail of missiles, especially when crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">together on the steps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Campo was the only one who had any fight left</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him. He struck Cosmo a blow on the head that</seg><seg type="columnLine">felled him, and then darted out upon the forepart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dome, running on the cleats, and made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo was on his feet in a second and rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in pursuit, closely followed by Jim Waters. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitive ran for the ratlines leading to the lookout</seg><seg type="columnLine">pn the central mast. He climbed them like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirrel, and the man in the cro'nest, amazed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight below him, stared at the approaching muti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neer, unable to utter a cry. Campo, who, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonbeams showed, now had a knife in his teeth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly approached, and the lookout shrank in terror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But before Campo could reach the cro'nest, a blind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing light dazzled his eyes. Cosmo had shouted an</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to Peterson to run back to the bridge and turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">a search-light upon the mast. Then Campo heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thundering voice below him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take another step and I'll blow you into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND DELUGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">949</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced below, and saw Cosmo and Waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering him with their pistols.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not another step!" roared Cosmo again. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, and I'll give you a trial for your life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Campo hesitated; but, seeing that he could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot down, and finding a gleam of hope in Cosmo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, he turned and came slowly down. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he touched the bottom he was seized by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waters and another man, and, under Cosmo's direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, his hands were bound behind his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes later the members of the crew who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been caught by the mutineers in the gangways</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all unbound, and then Cosmo broke open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of his cabin, the key having been lost or thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">away by Campo, and the captain and Joseph</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith were released.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we've got 'em," said Cosmo grimly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain. "The mutiny is at an end, and there'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">never be another."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime many of the passengers had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused by the unaccustomed noises, although the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistols had not made enough sound to be heard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place where they were fired. Nightcapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads appeared on all sides, and some, in scanty</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing, were wandering in the passageways, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manding what the trouble was. Cosmo, the captain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Joseph Smith reassured them, saying that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no danger, and that something had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would be explained in the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The prisoners--and the whole fifteen were finally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured--were locked up in a strong-room, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">surgeon was sent to dress their wounds. Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vers&amp;l and the captain resumed their accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">places on the bridge, where they talked over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair, and Cosmo explained his plans for the mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll give him his trial, as I promised," Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">said in conclusion, "and you'll see what it will be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mutiny aboard this Ark!" And he struck the rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">a violent blow with his fist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning directly after breakfast Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">called all passengers and crew into the grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon, where many wondering looks were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed and many puzzling questions asked. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mutineers, with hands tied behind their backs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their many bandages on arms and legs, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">led in, exclamations of astonishment were heard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some of the timid ones shrank away in fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo lost no time with preliminaries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These men," he said, taking his stand upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform, "have mutinied and tried to capture the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ark. This fellow"--pointing to Campo--"was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concocter and leader of the plot. He intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw me and Captain Arms, and all of you whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not wish to retain for his fiendish purposes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sea. But Heaven has delivered them into</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hands. I have promised them a trial, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall have it. But it will be a trial in which justice</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall not be cheated. I find that a moral poison has</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen into this selected company, and I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminate it for once and all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The expressions of amazement and alarm re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled in intensity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Professor Abel Able, Professor Jeremiah Moses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Wilfred Athelstone, Costak6 Theriade," Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, "you will please come forward to act</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as members of the jury, of which I name myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">also a member. I shall be both judge and jui-or</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, but I will hear what the rest of you may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men named stepped forward with some evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dences of embarrassment, and Cosmo gravely gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">them seats beside him. Then he commanded that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoners should confront the jury, and heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded, they were led to the front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The brutishness of Campo's face had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the passengers who had seen him before as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did now. He looked a veritable jailbird. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time he was evidently in terror for his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He muttered something which nobody understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo, who had informed himself of all the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstances from Waters, and by privately question-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the others, had satisfied himself that the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme of the mutiny was of Campo's contrivance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that they had been led into it solely by his per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suasion and threats, ordered Waters to speak. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">seaman told a straight story of what he had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seen. Cosmo himself then related the events of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night. When he had finished he turned to Cam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">po and demanded what he had to say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Campo again muttered under his breath, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no attempt to defend himself, simply saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You promised me a trial."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And haven't I given you a trial?" demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo with flashing eyes. "You thought you held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world in your grasp. It is I that hold it in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp and you, too! You were going to make us</seg><seg type="columnLine">'walk that plank.' It is you who are going to wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">it! Is that the verdict?" (turning to the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">jurymen.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of them nodded, some simply stared at Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mo, surprised by the vehemence of his manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enough," he said.. "As to you," addressing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other prisoners, "you have had your lesson; see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you don't forget it! Release them, and lead Campo</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the promenade deck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobody thought that Cosmo would literally exe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cute his threat to make the mutineer walk the plank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, as he had told Captain Arms, they didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. They were about to see that in Cosmo Versdl</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had not only a prophet, a leader, and a judge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but an inexorable master also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A plank was prepared and placed sloping from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Walk!" said Cosmo firmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To everybody's surprise Campo, with blinded</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, started immediately up the plank, followed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">full length with quick, unfaltering step, and plung-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the end, disappeared in the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many had turned away, unable to look, but many</seg><seg type="columnLine">also saw the tragedy to the end. Then a profound</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh was heard from the whole company of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectators. As they turned away, talking in awed</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices, they felt, as never before, that the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shrunk to the dimensions of the Ark, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo Versfil was its dictator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That same afternoon Cosmo arranged one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">"conferences," and nobody dared to be absent, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though all minds were yet too much excited to fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low the discussions which few could understand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But at length Costak§ Theriade concentrated their</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention by a wild burst of eloquence about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">950</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wonders of the inter-atomic forces. Sir Athelstone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to endure the applause that greeted his rival,</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly sprang to his feet, his round face red with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger, and shouted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say, 5'ou know, this is twaddle 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will the Englishman interrupt not?" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theriade, with his eyes ablaze. "Shall I project not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sir Englishman to the feeshes?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked as if he were about to try to execute</seg><seg type="columnLine">his threat, and Sir Athelstone assumed a boxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude; but before hostilities could begin a loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout from the deck, followed by cries and exclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, caused everybody to rush out of the saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those who succeeded in getting a glimpse over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulders of the members of the crew, who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">already lined up along the only portion of the bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warks available for seeing the part of the ocean on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which attention seemed to be fixed, stared open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthed at a round-backed mass of shining metal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a circular aperture on the top, the cover of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was canted to one side, and there stood a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving a gold-laced red kepi, and bowing and smil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with great civility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Jules Verne</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE swell of the sea caused the strange look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing craft to rise and sink a little, and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times the water ran bubbling all around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low rim of the aperture, in the center of which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-capped man stood, resting on some invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">support, repeating his salutations and amicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiles, and balancing his body to the rocking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waves with the unconscious skill of a sailor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ark was running slowly, but it would very</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon have left the stranger in its wake if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not also been in motion. It was evident that the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject under his feet must be a submersible vessel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some kind, although it was of a type which Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arms, standing beside Cosmo on the bridge, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared that he had never set eyes on before.

As the king was steadied across</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bottom of the companion-ladder, the voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the singers rose louder, and many of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers, moved by sympathy, or carried away</seg><seg type="columnLine">by epidemic feeling, joined in the singing. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any monarch a greeting like that! Its recipient</seg><seg type="columnLine">was moved to the depths of his soul, and but for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid given him would have been unable to ascend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying steps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he was assisted upon the deck, the song</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased and a great cheer broke forth.

He had not even replied to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo's invitation, but that was simply because,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like everybody about him in whom he placed con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence, he regarded Cosmo Versal as a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountebank, and thought that there was no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger of a universal flood than of the fall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon out of the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before responding to Cosmo's request he made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gracious reference to the indifference with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had formerly treated his present host.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sorry, Mr. Versal," he said, with a depreca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory smile, "that I did not sooner recognize the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that your knowledge surpassed that of my scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">advisers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your Majesty was not alone," replied Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravely, turning with his fingers a small globe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood on his desk.

All looked at him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">profound commiseration.

At last the broken-spirited mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arch was able to suppress his emotions sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to recite, but with many interruptions while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">regained mastery of his feelings, the story of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">woes and of his marvelous escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir Francis Brook," he said, "prepared a barge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the water invaded London, and in that barge</seg><seg type="columnLine">we escaped--Her Royal Majesty, our children, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of members of the Royal household--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barge was the only vessel of levium that existed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">England. Sir Francis had furnished and provis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned it well, and we did not think that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be necessary to go farther than to some high point</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the interior.

"The whole world has suffered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you.

"What we had suffered before seemed but</seg><seg type="columnLine">little in comparison. It came upon us after night;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the absolute darkness, the awful roaring, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific force of the falling water, the sense of suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">focation, the rapid filling of the barge until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water was about our necks--these things drove us</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild with despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tried to sustain my poor queen in my arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she struggled to seize the children and hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">them above the water, and in her efforts she escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my hands, and thenceforth I could find her no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. I stumbled about, but it was impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see; it was impossible to be heard. At last I fell un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious face downward, as it afterward appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a kind of bench at the rear end of the barge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was covered with a narrow metallic roofing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raised above the level of the bulwarks.

"I don't think you'd find any there to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescue if you could get to them. They must all have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been lost in the torrents that poured down those</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More's the pity," said Captain Arms. "That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fine lot of women. There'll be no more cheese like</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they made at Tresvido."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo inquired if the captain's acquaintance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the topography of the range enabled him to say how</seg><seg type="columnLine">high that water was. The captain, after long in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spection, declared that he felt sure that it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than four thousand feet above the old coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then," said Cosmo, "if you're right about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevation of what you call the Torre de Cerredo</seg><seg type="columnLine">there must be four thousand six hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy feet of its upper part still out of water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll see if that is so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo made the measurements with his instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, and announced that the result showed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">substantial accuracy of Captain Arms' guess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suspected as much," he muttered. "Those tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous downpours, which may have been worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">elsewhere than where we encountered them, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased the rise nearly seventy per cent above</seg><seg type="columnLine">what my gages indicated. Now that I know this,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued, addressing the captain: "I'll change</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course of the Ark. I'm anxious to get into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian Ocean as soon as possible. It would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great waste of time to go back in order to cross the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sahara, and with this increase of level it isn't nec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">essary. We'll just set out across southern France,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping along north of the Pyrenees, and ao down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the region of the Mediterranean."-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Arms was astonished by the boldness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this suggestion, and at first he strongly objected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their taking such a course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's some pretty high ground in southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">France," he said. "There's the Cevennes moun«</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, which approach a good long way toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pyrenees.

As long as the sky is clear you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">get good observations, and you ought to be navi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gator enough not to run on a mountain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo Versal, as usual, was unalterable in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolution--he only changed when he had reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own--and the course of the Ark was laid, ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordingly, for the old French coast of the Landes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so low that it was now covered with nearly four</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet of water. The feelings of the passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers were deeply stirred when they learned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were actually sailing over buried Europe, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they gazed in astonishment at the water beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, peering down into it as if they sought to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover the dreadful secrets that it hid, and talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">excitedly in a dozen languages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ark progressed slowly, making not more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">five or six knots, and on the second day after they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped the Penas de Europa they were passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the northern flank of the Pyrenees and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the basin in which had lain the beautiful city of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pau. The view of the Pyrenees from this point had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always been celebrated as one of the most remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now it had lost its beauty, but gained in spectac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular grandeur. All of France, as far as the eye ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended, was a sea, with long oceanic swells slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">undulating its surface. This sea abruptly came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an end where it met the mountains, which formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it a coast unlike any that the hundreds of eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which wonderingly surveyed it from the Ark had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever beheld.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the drowned vales and submerged ranges,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they knew lay beneath the watery floor, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore them, rose the heads of the Pic du Midi, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pic de Ger, the Pic de Bigorre, the Massif du</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gabizos, the Pic Monn6, and dozens of other famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">eminences, towering in broken ranks like the bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins of a "forlorn hope," resisting to the last, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures of old-time battles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here, owing to the configuration of the drowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">land it was possible for the Ark to approach quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to some of the wading mountains, and Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the opportunity to make a new measure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of the flood, which he found to be surely not</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than his former estimates had shown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surveying with telescopes the immense shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the MonnS, the Vicos, the d'Ardiden, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer heights, when they were floating above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley of Lourdes, Cosmo and the captain saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible effects that had been produced by the tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rents of rain, which had stripped off the vegetation</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose green robe had been the glory of the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pyrenees on the French side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently their attention was arrested by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving objects, and at a second glance they per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived that there were human beings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">954</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Heaven!" exclaimed Cosmo Versal. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are survivors here. They have climbed the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, and found shelter among the rocks. I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have thought it possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And there are women among them," said Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Arms, lowering his telescope.

By gad, sir, TU</seg><seg type="columnLine">not leave 'em!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time somp of the passengers who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful glasses had discovered the refugees on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distant heights, and great excitement spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the Ark.

"Don't let</seg><seg type="columnLine">them perish!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo Versal was in a terrible quandary. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">by no means without humanity, and was capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of deep and sympathetic feeling, as we have seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he already had as many persons in the Ark as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought ought to be taken, considering the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision that had been made, and, besides, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not throw off, at once, his original conviction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity of carefully choosing his companions. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained for a long time buried in tho'ught, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain fumed with impatience, and at last de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared that if Cosmo did not give the order to lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the boats he would do it himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length Cosmo, yielding rather to his own hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mane feelings than to the urging of others, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented to make the experiment. Half a dozen levi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">um launches were quickly lowered and sent off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the Ark, with slowed engines, remained de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribing a circle as near the mountains as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe to go. Cosmo himself embarked in the leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The powerful motors of the launches carried them</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly to the high slopes where the unfortunates</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sought refuge, and as they approached, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor fugitives saw that deliverance was at hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they began to shout, and cheer, and cry, and many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them fell on their knees upon the rocks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched their hands toward the heavens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The launches were compelled to move with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution when they got near the ragged sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">submerged mountains (it was the Peyre Dufau on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the people had taken refuge), but the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard them were determined to effect the rescue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they regarded no peril too closely. At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo's launch found a safe landing, and the, others</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly followed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Cosmo sprang out on a flat rock a crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men, women, and children, weeping, crying, sob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing, and uttering prayers and blessings, instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded him. Some wrung his hand in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecstasy of joy, some embraced him, some dropped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their knees before him and sought to kiss his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo could not restrain his tears, and the crews</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the launches were equally affected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many of these people could only speak the patois</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mountains, but some were refugees from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">resorts in the valleys below, and among these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">two English tourists who had been caught among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains by the sudden rising of the flood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They exhibited comparative sang froid, and served</seg><seg type="columnLine">as spokesmen for the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bah Jove!" exclaimed one of them, "but you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome, you know! This has been a demnition</seg><seg type="columnLine">close call! But what kind of a craft have you got</seg><seg type="columnLine">out there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm Cosmo Versal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then that's the Ark we've heard about! 'Pon</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor, I should have recognized you, for I've seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">your picture often enough. You've come to take us</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, I suppose?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly," replied Cosmo. "How many are</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All that you see here; about a hundred I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">say.

There must have been a thousand of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we started, but most of them perished, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come by the downpour, or swept away by the tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rents. Lord Swansdown (indicating his compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion, who bowed gravely and stiffly) and myself--■</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm Edward Whistlington--set out to walk over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pyrenees from end to end, after the excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the great darkness died out, and we got as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Marbore, and then running down to Gavarnie</seg><seg type="columnLine">we heard news of the sea rising, but we didn't give</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much credit to that, and afterward, keeping up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the heights, we didn't hear even a rumor from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sky opened on us like a broadside from an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aerial squadron, and how we ever managed to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">here I'm sure I can hardly tell. We were actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried down the mountainsides by the water, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">how it failed to drown us will be an everlasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery. Somehow, we found ourselves among</seg><seg type="columnLine">these people, who were trying to go up, assuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">us that there was nothing but water below. And at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last we discovered some sort of shelter here--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">here we've been ever since."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You cannot have had much to eat," said Cosmo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not too much, I assure you," replied the English-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, with a melancholy smile. "But these people</seg><seg type="columnLine">shared with us what little they had, or could find--</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything and everything that was eatable. They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">a devilish fine lot, I tell you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the terrible rain suddenly ceased and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky cleared," he resumed, "we managed to get dry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a day or two, and since then we've been chew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing leather until there isn't a shoe or a belt left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We thought at first of trying to build rafts--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">then where could we go? It wasn't any use to sail</seg><seg type="columnLine">out over a drowned country, with nothing in sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the mountains around us, which looked no bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter than the one we were barely existing on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I must get you aboard the Ark before you</seg><seg type="columnLine">starve," said Cosmo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Many have died of starvation already," returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whistlington.

His sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathies were thoroughly aroused, and while he has-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened the loading and departure of the launches, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND DELUGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">asked the Englishmen who, with the impassive en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">durance of their race, stayed behind to the last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether they thought that there were other refu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gees on the mountains whom they could reach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dare say there are thousands of the poor devils</seg><seg type="columnLine">on these peaks around us, wandering among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks," replied Edward Whistlington, "but I fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">you couldn't reach 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I see any I'll try," returned Cosmo, sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his telescope all the mountain flanks within</seg><seg type="columnLine">view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, on the slopes of the lofty Mont Aigu</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the submerged valley toward the south, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught sight of several human figures, one of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plainly trying to make signals, probably to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tract attention from the Ark. Immediately, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Englishmen and the remainder of those who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been found on the Peyre Dufau, he hastened in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch to the rescue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They found four men and three women, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped from the narrow valley containing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bains de Gazost, and who were in the last stages of</seg><seg type="columnLine">starvation. These were taken aboard, and then, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more being in sight, Cosmo returned to the Ark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the other launches had already arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And these were the last that were rescued from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mighty range of the Pyrenees, in whose deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">valleys had lain the famous resorts of Cauterets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Eaux Bonnes, the Eaux Chaudes, the Bagnieres</seg><seg type="columnLine">de Luchon, the Bagnieres de Bigorre, and a score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. No doubt, as the Englishmen had said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands had managed to climb the mountains, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">none could now be seen, and those who may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been there were left to perish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was great excitement in the Ark on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival of the refugees. The passengers over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed them with kind attentions, and when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sufficiently recovered, listened with wonder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deepest sympathy to their tales of suffering</seg><seg type="columnLine">and terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lord Swansdown and Edward Whistlington were</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed to find their king aboard the Ark, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">English members of the company soon formed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of family party, presided over by the unfortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nate monarch. The rescued persons numbered, in all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred and six.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The voyage of the Ark was now resumed, skirt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the Pyrenees, but at an increasing distance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally Captain Arms announced that, according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his observations, they were passing over the site</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ancient and populous city of Toulouse. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalled to Cosmo Versal's memory the beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">scenes of the fair and rich land that lay so deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the Ark, and he began to talk with the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain about the glories of its history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke of the last great conqueror that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world had known, Napoleon, and was discussing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his marvelous career, and referring to the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had died on a rock in the midst of that very</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean which had now swallowed up all the scenes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his conquests, when the lookout telephoned down</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was something visible on the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a little while they saw it--a small moving ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject, which rapidly approached the Ark.

The submersible was</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely moored alongside, where she rode easily in</seg><seg type="columnLine">company with the larger vessel, and all mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the companion-ladder.

He was deeply touched by the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the recent rescue of his countrymen from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pyrenees, and he went among them, trying to cheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up, with the Sian that no misfortune can eradi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate from the Gallic nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length Cosmo reminded him that he had said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had some interesting news to communicate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said de Beauxchamps, "I have just come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a visit to Paris."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Exclamations of amazement and incredulity were</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard on all sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is true," resumed the Frenchman, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">now his voice lost .all its gaiety.

It is my reg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular custom to rise frequently to the surface to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look around and make surer of my bearings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know that the Ark makes a pretty large point</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the waters.

As I was saying, I started</seg><seg type="columnLine">for France, poor drowned France, as soon as I left</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. With the powerful search-light of the Jules</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verne I could feel confident of avoiding obstruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions; and, besides, I knew very closely the height</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which the flood had risen, and having the topo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">graphy of my country at my fingers' ends, as does</seg><seg type="columnLine">every officer of the army, I was able to calculate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth at which we should run in order to avoid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilltops."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But surely," said Cosmo, "it is impossible--at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, it seems so to me--that you can descend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">any great depth--the pressure must be tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few hundred feet down, to say nothing of pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible thousands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All that," replied the Frenchman, "has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided for.

The aspect of the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">they traversed affrighted them. Here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were partially demolished houses or farm struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, or cellars, choked with debris of what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once been houses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farm implements and machinery were scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and half buried in the torrent-furrowed land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the wreck of one considerable village through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they passed they found a stone church, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">several stone houses of considerable pretentions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing almost intact as to walls, but with roofs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors and windows smashed and torn off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was evident that this place, which lay in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">depression of the land, had been buried by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing water as high as the top stories of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings. From some of the sights that they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">they shrank away, and afterward tried to forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Owing to the presence of the women and chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren their progress was slower than it might other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise have been. They had great difficulty in cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the course of the torrent which their compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions had described as cutting them off from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot-hills of the Pike's Peak range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The water had washed out a veritable canon, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred or more feet deep in places, and with rag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ged, precipitous walls and banks, which they had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">descend on one side and ascend on the other. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skill and local knowledge of their three new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">found friends stood them in good stead. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet enough water in the bottom of the great gully to</seg><seg type="columnLine">compel them to wade, carrying the women and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, just before nightfall, they succeeded in reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a range of rocky heights, where they deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined to pass the night. They managed to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire with brush that had been swept down the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain flanks and had remained wedged in the rocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus they dried their soaked garments, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to do some cooking, and to have a blaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give them a little heat during the night, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air turned cold after the disappearance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the others had sunk into an uneasy slum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, the President and Professor Pludder sat long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">replenishing the fire, and talking of their future</seg><seg type="columnLine">course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," said the professor, "that we shall find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a considerable population alive among the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains. There is nothing in Colorado below four</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet elevation, and not much below five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand. The great inner 'parks' were probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into lakes, but they will drain off, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land around us here has done already.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those who managed to find places of comparative</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter will now descend into the level lands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">960</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">try to hunt up the site of their homes.

My confidence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">you was shaken, but now I follow you again."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus they talked until midnight, and then got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little rest with the others. They were up and off</seg><seg type="columnLine">at break of day, and as they mounted higher they</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to encounter immense rocks that had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbling down from above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can you talk of people escaping toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains if they had to encounter these?" de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded the President.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some of these rocks have undoubtedly been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brought down by the torrents," Professor Pludder</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied, "but I believe that the greater number fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier, during the earthquakes that accompanied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first invasions of the sea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But those earthquakes may have continued all</seg><seg type="columnLine">through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not think so. We have felt no trembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth. I believe that the convulsions lasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">only for a brief period, while the rocks were yield-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the pressure along the old sea-coast. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little the crust below adjusted itself to the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions. And even if the rocks fell while people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were trying to escape from the flood below, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">must, like the water, have followed the gorges and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow places, while the fugitives would, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep upon the ridges."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whatever perils they may have encountered, peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple had certainly escaped as the professor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">averred. When the party, in the middle of the day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seated at their lunch, on an elevated point</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which they could see far over the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean that they had left behind them, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southern buttresses of Pike's Peak rose steeply to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the north, they discovered the first evidence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the existence of refugees in the mountains. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a smoke rising over an intervening ridge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which their new companions declared could be due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to nothing less than a large camp-fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hastened to finish their meal, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed the ridge. As soon as they reached it they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found themselves looking down into a broad, shallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon, where there were nearly twenty rudely con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed cabins, with a huge fire blazing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of the place, and half a dozen red-shirted men</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy about it, evidently occupied in the preparation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dinner of a large party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their friends recognized an acquaintance in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the men below and hailed him with delight. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly men, women and children came running out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the huts to look at them, and as they descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">into this improvised village they were received</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a hospitality that was almost hilarious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The refugees consisted of persons who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped from the lower lands in the immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicinity, and they were struck dumb when told that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were entertaining the President of the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States and his family.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The entire history of their adventures was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated on both sides. The refugees told how, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commencement of the great rain, when it became</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that the water would inundate their farms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buildings, they loaded themselves with as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">provisions as they could carry, and, in spite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufFocating downpour that filled the air, managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight their way to the ridge overhanging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep cut in which they were now encamped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly a quarter of those who started arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in safety. They sheltered themselves to the number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of about thirty, in a huge cavern, which faced down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain, and had a slightly upward sloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, so that the water did not enter. Here, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful economy, they were able to eke out their</seg><seg type="columnLine">provisions until the sky cleared, after which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, being used to outdoor labor and hunting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrived to supply the wants of the forlorn littte</seg><seg type="columnLine">community.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND DELUGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">961</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They managed to kill a few animals, and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bodies of others recently killed, or drowned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later they descended into the lowlands, as the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran off, and searching among the ruins of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses found some remnants of supplies in the cel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars and about the foundations of the barns. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were preparing to go down in a body and seek to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reestablish themselves on the sites of their old</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes, when the President's party came upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The meeting with these refugees was but the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a series of similar encounters on the way along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eastern face of the Pike's Peak range. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aggregate they met several hundred survivors who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had established themselves on the site of Colorado</seg><seg type="columnLine">Springs, where a large number of houses, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the higher ground, had escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had been soaked with water, descending</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the shattered roofs and broken windows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pouring into the basements and cellars; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitives came from all directions, some from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caverns on the mountains, and some from the rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the north and east. A considerable number</seg><seg type="columnLine">asserted that they had found refuge in the Garden</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Gods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As near as could be estimated, about a quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the population remained alive. The strong points</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Professor Pludder now, once more, came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">conspicuously. He proved himself an admirable</seg><seg type="columnLine">organizer. He explored all the country round, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enheartened everybody, setting them to work to</seg><seg type="columnLine">repair the damage as much as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some horses and cattle were found whicKTfollow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their instincts, had managed to escape the flood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the houses and other buildings yet standing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great deal of food and other supplies was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered, so that there was no danger of a famine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he had anticipated, the soil had not all been</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed away from the flat land, and he advised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants to plant quick-growing seeds at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He utilized the horses to send couriers in all direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, some going even as far as Denver. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where virtually the same conditions were found--</seg><seg type="columnLine">many had escaped and were alive, only needing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guidance of a quicker intelligence, and this was sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied by the advice which the professor instructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his envoys to spread among the people. He sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cheer them still more by the information that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President was among them, and looking out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their welfare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing which his couriers at last began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">report to him was a cause of surprise. They said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the level of the water was rapidly falling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some who had gone far toward the east declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it had gone down hundreds of feet. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor reflected that this was impossible, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">evaporation could not account for it, and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not persuade himself that so much water could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found its way into the interior of the crust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He concluded that his informants had allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hopes to affect their eyesight, and, strong as</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual in his professional dogmas, he made no per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal examination. Besides, Professor Pludder</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beginning to be shaken in his first belief that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all trouble from the nebula was at an end. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">having been forced to accept the hypothesis that a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">watery nebula had met the earth, ha began to reflect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they might not be through with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In any event, he deemed it wise to prepare for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it should come back. Accordingly he advised that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the population that remained should concentrate in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stronger houses, built of stone, and that every</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort should be made to strengthen them further</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to make the roofs as solid as possible. He also</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed that no houses should be occupied that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not situated on high ground, surrounded with slopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would give ready flow to the water in case the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deluging rain should recommence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no fixed conviction that it would recom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mence, but he was uneasy, owing to his reflections,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wished to be on the safe side. He sent similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions as far as his horsemen could reach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wisdom of his doubts became manifest about</seg><seg type="columnLine">two weeks after the arrival of the President's party.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without warning the sky, which had been perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue and cloudless for a month, turned a sickly yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. Then mists hid the head, and in a little while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire outline of Pike's Peak, and after that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy rain began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Terror instantly seized the people, and at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody ventured out of doors. But as time went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rain did not assume the proportions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">former debacle, although it was very heavy and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuous, hope revived. Everybody was on the watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a sudden clearing up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of clearing, however, the rain became</seg><seg type="columnLine">very irregular, gushing at time in torrents which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were even worse than the original downpour, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">these tremendous gushes were of brief duration, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the water had an opportunity to run off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher ground before the next downpour occurred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This went on for a week, and then the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were terrified at finding that water was pouring up</seg><seg type="columnLine">through all the depressions of the land, cutting off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the highlands from Pike's Peak with an arm of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea. It was evident that the flood had been rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising, and if it should rise but little higher they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be caught in a trap. The inland sea, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, had now invaded the whole of Colorado to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of the mountains, and was creeping up on them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just at this time a series of earthquakes began.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were not severe, but were continuous. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground cracked open in places, and some houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">were overturned, but there were no wall-shattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocks--only a continual and dreadful trembling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied by awful subterranean sounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This terrible state of affairs had lasted for a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">before a remarkable discovery was made, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled many hearts with joy, although it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzle Professor Pludder as much as it rejoiced him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The new advance of the sea was arrested! There</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be no question of that, for too many had</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously noted the points to which the water had</seg><seg type="columnLine">attained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We have said that Professor Pludder was puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled. He was seeking, in his mind, a connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the seismic tremors and the cessation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the advance of the sea. Inasmuch as the downpour</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, the flood ought still to rise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rejected as soon as it occurred to him the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the earth could be drinking up the waters as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast as they fell, and the idea that the trembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">962</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was an accompaniment of this gigantic deglutition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting in a room with the President and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the party from Washington, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained buried in his thoughts, answering inquiries</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in monosyllables. Presently he opened his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">very wide and a long-drawn "A-ah!" came from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. Then he sprang to his feet and cried out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but only as if uttering a thought aloud to himself:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The batkoliteI"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXI</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Father of Horror"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT the time when the President of the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States and his companions were beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discover the refugees around Pike's Peak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo Versal's Ark accompanied by the J-ules</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verne, whose commander had decided to remain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch with his friends, was crossing the submerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills and valleys of Languedoc under a sun as bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant as that which had once made them a land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold. De Beauxchamps remained aboard the Ark</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo liked to have him with himself and Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Arms on the bridge, because there they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk freely about their plans and prospects, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman was a most entertaining companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile, the passengers in the saloons and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the promenade decks formed little knots and coteries</seg><seg type="columnLine">for conversation, for reading, and for mutual diver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, or strolled about from side to side, watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the endless expanse of waters for the occasional ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of some inhabitant of the deep that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered over the new ocean's bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These seemed to be coming to the surface to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearings. Every such incident reminded them of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what lay beneath the waves, and led them to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">and talk of the awful fate that had overwhelmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fellow men, until the spirits of the most care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less were subdued by the pervading melancholy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> King Richard, strangely enough, had taken a lik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for Amos Blank, who was frequently asked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">join the small and somewhat exclusive circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">compatriots that continually surrounded the fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">monarch. The billionaire and the king often leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow to elbow over the rail, and put their heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">companionably together while pointing out some ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject on the sea. Lord Swansdown felt painfully cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this, but, of course, he could offer no objection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally Cosmo invited the king to come upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge, from which passengers were generally ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded, and the king insisted that Blank should go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. Cosmo consented, for Blank seemed to him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have become quite a changed man, and was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times full of practical suggestions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it happened that when Captain Arms an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced that the Ark was passing over the ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of Carcassonne, Cosmo, the king, de Beaux-</seg><seg type="columnLine">champs, Amos Blank, and the captain were all to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether on the bridge. When Captain Arms men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned their location, King Richard became very</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtful. After musing for a time he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! how all these names, Toulouse, Carcassonne,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Languedoc, bring back to me the memory of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">namesake of olden times, Richard I of England.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, over which we are floating, was the land of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Troubadours, and Richard was the very Prince of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Troubadours. With all his faults England never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a king like him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Knowing your devotion to peace, which was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason why I wished you to be of the original com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany in the Ark, I am surprised to hear you say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that," said Cosmo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! But Cceur de Lion was a true Englishman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even in his love of fighting. What would he say if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew where England lies to-day? What would</seg><seg type="columnLine">he say if he knew the awful fate that had come upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fair and pleasant land, from whose poets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">singers he learned the art of minstrelsy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"He would say, 'Do not despair,' " returned Cos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mo. " 'Show the courage of an Englishman, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight for your race if you cannot for your country.' "</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But may not England, may not all these lands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerge again from the floods?" asked the king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not in our time, not in our children's time," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied Cosmo Versal, thoughtfully shaking his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"In the remote future, yes--but I cannot tell how</seg><seg type="columnLine">remote. Tibet was once an appanage of your crown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before China taught the West what war meant, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Tibet you may help to found a new empire, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must tell you that it will not resemble the empires</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the past. Democracy will be its corner-stone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and science its law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I devote myself to democracy and science,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">responded King Richard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good! Admirable!" exclaimed Amos Blank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">de Beauxchamps simultaneously, while Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arms seemed on the point of patting the king on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. But his attention, together with that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, was distracted by a huge whale blowing al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most directly in the course of the Ark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Blessed if I ever expected to see a sight like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in these parts!" exclaimed the captain. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting the ocean up into the sky is upsetting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order of nature. I'd as soon expect to sight a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cachalot on top of the Rocky Mountains."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll be there, too, before long," said Cosmo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I wonder what he's looking for," continued Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Arms. "He must have come down from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north. He couldn't have got in through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pyrenees or the Sierra Nevadas. He's just navi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gated right over the whole country, straight down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the channel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whale sounded at the approach of the Ark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in a little while he was blowing again off to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the south, and then the passengers caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of him, and there was great excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to be of enormous size, and he sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fountain to an extraordinary height in the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On he went, appearing and disappearing, steering</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct for Africa, until, only with glasses, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">they see his white plume blowing on the horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not even the reflection that they themselves were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailing over Europe impressed some of the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers with so vivid a sense of their situation as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of this monstrous inhabitant of the ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking a view of his new domain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At night Cosmo continued the concerts and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presentation of the Shakespearian dramas, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour each afternoon he had a "conference" in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saloon, at which Theriade and Sir Athelstone</seg><seg type="columnLine">were almost the sole performers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SECOND DELUGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">963</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their disputes, and Cosmo's efforts to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace, amused for a while, but at length the audi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences diminished until Cosmo himself, with his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant companions, the Frenchman, the king, Amos</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blank, the three professors from Washington, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few other savants were the only listeners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the music and the plays always drew im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mensely. Joseph Smith was kept busy most of tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in Cosmo's cabin, copying plans for the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">generation of mankind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they knew that they had passed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">borders of France and were sailing above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mediterranean Sea, it became necessary to lay their</seg><seg type="columnLine">course with considerable care. Cosmo decided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only safe plan would be to run south of Sardinia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then keep along between Sicily and Tunis, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so on toward lower Egypt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There he intended to seek a way over the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains north of the Sinai peninsula into the Syrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert, from which he could reach the ancient valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Euphrates and the Persian Gulf. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">then pass down the Arabian Sea, swing round India,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ceylon, and, by way of the Bay of Bengal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plains of the Ganges and Brahmaputra, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach the Himalayas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Arms was rather inclined to follow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gulf of Suez and the depression of the Red Sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Cosmo was afraid that they would have dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficulty in getting the Ark safely through between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mt. Sinai peaks and the Jebel Gharib range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you're the commodore," said the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end of the discussion, "but hang me if I'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">not rather follow a sea, where I know the courses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than go navigating over mountains and deserts in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land of Shinar. We'll land on top of Jerusalem</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, you'll see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Feeling sure of plenty of water under keel, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">now made better speed, and de Beauxchamps retired</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Jules Verne, and detached it from the Ark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finding that he could distance the latter easily with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the submersible running just beneath the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come up to blow, and take a look around from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge, once in a while," the captain called out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him as he disappeared and the cover closed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The Jules Verne immediately sank out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They passed round Sardinia, and between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old African coast and Sicily, and were approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Malta Channel,,when their attention was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to vast smoke far off toward the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's Etna in eruption," said Cosmo to the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A magnificent sight!" exclaimed King Richard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who happened to be on the bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, and I'd like to see it nearer," remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo, as a wonderful column of smoke, as black</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ink, seemed to shoot up to the very zenith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd better keep away," Captain Arms said</seg><seg type="columnLine">warningly. "There's no good comes of fooling round</seg><seg type="columnLine">volcanoes in a ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it's safe enough," returned Cosmo. "We can</seg><seg type="columnLine">run right over the southeastern corner of Sicily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get as near as we like. There is nothing higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">than about three thousand feet in that part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, so we'll have a thousand feet to spare."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But maybe the water has lowered somewhat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not more than a foot or two," said Cosmo. "Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain plainly didn't fancy the adventure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he obeyed orders, and the Ark's nose was turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward, to the delight of many of the passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had become greatly interested when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that the tremendous smoke that they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from Mount Etna. Some of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">nexwous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The more adventurous spirits heartily applauded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cosmo Versal's design to give them a closer view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">so extraordinary a spectacle. Even from their pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent distance the sight was one that might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled them all with terror if they had not already</seg><seg type="columnLine">been through adventures which had hardened their</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves. The smoke was truly terrific in appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It did not spread low over the sea, but rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an almost vertical column, widening out at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of several miles, until it seemed to canopy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole sky toward the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It could be seen spinning in immense rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses, the outer part of which were turned by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunshine to a dingy brown color, while the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem of the column, rising directly from the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater, was of pitchy blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An awful roaring was audible, sending a shiver</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Ark. At the bottom of the mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke, through which gleams of fire were seen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot as they drew nearer, appeared the huge coni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal form of the mountain, whose dark bulk still rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly seven thousand feet above the sea that cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the great, beautiful, and historic island be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had got within about twenty miles of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the mountain, when a shout was heard by</seg><seg type="columnLine">those on the bridge, and Cosmo and the captain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for its source, saw the Jules Verne, risen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface, a little to starboard, and de Beaux-</seg><seg type="columnLine">champs excitedly signaling to them.

Accordingly they steered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that direction, and on the way passed directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the site of Cairo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the thought of the pyramids came to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, and de Beauxchamps, who had come aboard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ark, and who was always moved by sentimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerations, proposed that they should spend a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few hours here, while he descended to inspect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition in which the flood had left those mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">monuments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo not only consented to this, but he even</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered to be a member of the party.

Without him they knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to be helpless. Even Captain Arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost lost his nerve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strong good sense of Amos Blank alone saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the utter despair that began to seize</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as hour after hour passed without the reap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of the Jules Veme.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His experience had taught him how to keep a</seg><seg type="columnLine">level head in an emergency, and how to control</seg><seg type="columnLine">panics. With King Richard always at his side, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went about among the passengers and fairly laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them out of their fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without discussing the matter at all, he convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, by simple force of his own apparent confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence, that they were worrying themselves about</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was, in fact, as much alarmed as any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, but he never showed it.

The water was somewhat muddy from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of the desert, and the search-light streamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a yellowish medium, recalling the "golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere" for which Egypt had been celebrated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, nevertheless, the light was so powerful that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could see distinctly at a distance of several</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pyramid appeared to have been but little in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured, although the tremendous tidal wave that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept up the Nile during the invasion of the sea be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the downpour began had scooped out the sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the bed-rock on all sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finding nothing of particular interest in a cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuit of the pyramid, they turned in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Great Sphinx.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, too, had been excavated to its base, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">now stood up to its full height, and a terrible ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression seemed to have come into its enigmatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cosmo wished to get a close look at it, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran the submersible into actual contact with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forepart of the gigantic statue, just under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While they paused there, gazing out of the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">window of the vessel, a bursting sound was heard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by a loud crash, and the Jules Verne was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken from stem to stern. Every man of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself against the sides of the vessel, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound came from overhead, and they had an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctive notion that the roof was being crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A second resounding crash was heard, shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">them like an earthquake, and the little vessel rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly over upon its side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'We are lost!" cried de Beauxchamps.

But no water</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stunned by the suddenness of the accident, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments they did nothing but cling to such sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ports as were within their reach, expecting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">another blow would either force the vessel com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely over or break the roof in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But complete silence now reigned, and the mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siles from above ceased to strike the submersible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The search-light continued to beam out of the fore</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the vessel, and following its broad ray with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes, they uttered one cry of mingled amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and fear, and then stared without a word at</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a spectacle as the wildest imagination could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have pictured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The front of the Sphinx had disappeared, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">light, penetrating beyond the place where it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, streamed upon the face and breast of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous black figure, seated on a kind of throne,</seg><seg type="columnLine">.and staring into their faces with flaming eyes which</seg><seg type="columnLine">tat once fascinated and terrified them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To their startled imaginations the eyes seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to roll in their sockets, and flashes of fire to dart</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them.

"They've come up in diving-suits."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amos Blank comprehended the situation at once;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and while the captain was attending to getting out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat, he explained matters to the crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The submersible must be lost," he said quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but the men have escaped, so there is no great</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm done. It does great credit to that Frenchman</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he should have been prepared for such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency. Those are levium suits, and I've no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt that he has got hydrogen somewhere inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">to increase their buoyancy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within a quarter of an hour all the seven had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been picked up by the boat, and returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ark. The strange forms were lifted aboard with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tackle to save time; and as the first one reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck, it staggered about on its big limbs for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the metallic head opened, and the features</seg><seg type="columnLine">of de Beauxchamps were revealed within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before anybody could assist him he had freed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self from the suit, and immediately began to aid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. In ten minutes they all stood safe and sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the astonished eyes of the spectators. Cosmo</seg><seg type="columnLine">had suffered the most from the confinement, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank upon a seat, but de Beauxchamps seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the most affected. With downcast look he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sadly shaking his head:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The poor Jules Ferae!

Within five minutes he was bending over Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unsinn, and, being as all doctors should be, a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">discreet man, he forbore to make embarrassing in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiries as to the manner in which Lemuel had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived the wounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To my intense relief he assured me that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fracture and no injuries more serious than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one deep gash and severe contusions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lemuel regained consciousness as the doctor was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bandaging the wound, but he made no attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak, and, for that matter, his face was too swollen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and painful to permit him to utter an intelligible</seg><seg type="columnLine">word for the next twenty-four hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime we eagerly bought and read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers which were filled with accounts of the Hart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well Building mystery, and I could see by Lemuel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression, even through his bandages, that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">immensely pleased at the attention his feat had</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted. There were also items regarding our,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rather Lemuel's, other exploits. A score of per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons had reported the incident of the fainting wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man; the man in the subway station had related</seg><seg type="columnLine">his experience, but not a word appeared in print</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding the sudden vanishing of the car. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt the guard hesitated to mention or report the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter fearing that his superiors might, quite rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonably, feel that a guard subject to such hallucina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions was unfit for his position. And, in all prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability, the passengers who had been present and</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, the chances were, had spoken to the guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">after our departure, were convinced that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been subjected to some optical illusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And of course there was no reference to the thief-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chase or Lemuel's injuries, for the thief alone had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen anything out of the ordinary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And of course no one had suspected our connec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with all the phenomena, for which I was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely thankful, although it did not please Lemuel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who declared, somewhat peevishly that he had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived no credit for his astounding discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Credit!" I exclaimed, "If the police knew you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at the bottom of these things you'd very prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably be in jail by now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And," I continued, "I hope this last., experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yours has convinced you that I was right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that your discovery is a menace. If you take my</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice you'll destroy every one of your formulae</seg><seg type="columnLine">and every confounded contraption that has to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the invention."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A wry grin twisted Dr. Unsinn's plastered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandaged face. "No," he declared, "I shall destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing.

It is, I fear, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast in its possibilities to be given to the world as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had planned. But I still am positive that it is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most important discovery and, if properly employed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be of incalculable benefit to the world.
