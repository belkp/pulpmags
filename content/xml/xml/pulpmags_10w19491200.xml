Hla</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance swung toward the bank, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Eben. about the solid, respectable</seg><seg type="columnLine">pattern of Pineville.

Last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, Bill McClane, of the Bell-Bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread, had been killed in a raid on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize horses. This morning, Vigilante</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rafferty had spotted the Slater family</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding near the canyon on four Bell-Bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses. The Slaters tried to feed Rafferty</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cock-and-bull yarn about having bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horses from four other fellows an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Rafferty had started to make his arrest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Slaters broke away hell-bent and holed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in their cabin. They had fired at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing Vigilante. Rafferty then had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridden back to town for reinforcements.</seg><seg type="columnLine">COLL LAKE stuck his bearded face</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the side of the rock. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds down there in the cabin," he shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through cupped hands, "We've cot you</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered.

Clem and me begun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think the quarry had skipped. Then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high, nervous voice yelled out, "You go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blazes!

Tom Slater, his brother and father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and young son, Tim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They walked slowly toward us, hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised.

Bring over the ropes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rafferty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rafferty was looking a little green about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gills.

The evidence was all against</seg><seg type="columnLine">those four captured men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe we oughta have a trial," Clem</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared me by announcing. "Just to be on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sure side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought Coll Lake would jump down</seg><seg type="columnLine">my brother's throat.

Rafferty and a couple other</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows adjusted the noose about the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slaters' necks, shoved them up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottonwoods. The free ends of the ropes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tossed over limbs and tied to saddle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns of waiting horsemen. All four of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captives looked pretty grim and white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced, but they didn't break down like</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd expect. Somebody gave old Matt</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slater a chaw of tobacco, and he worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it silently, thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tim Slater, the sixteen year-old, showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more courage than I would have, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes. He just stared ahead, biting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower lip a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom and Mark Slater smoked quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the cigarettes they'd requested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Coll Lake raised his hand for the sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal.

"They want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say they're innocent, and that neither you</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor the rest of your so-called lawdogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">are going to hang them for it.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">never spoke to Tott, but he knew she</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him sometimes, and he felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow he stirred her interest. When-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever their eyes met, she put on an arro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gant look and turned away. She spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Suggs now in a quiet voice and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">toothless jaws clamped shut to hold back</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he wanted to say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cap Andre, trailing again as usual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">said; "Who did this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kell Arbo canted his head toward Tott.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HANG-TREE TRAIL</seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg><seg type="columnLine">''You would have to hire a blue-nose Fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">who can't take a little ribbing, wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" he remarked, critically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You dirty lyin' crook," Tott flared sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly.

Kell Arbo's head whipped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tott gave him another blow in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach, doubling him up.

Young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casson, usually full of starch and bluster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly turned and stumbled back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet touched the ground and he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">on tiptoe, neck stretched so his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheezed out of his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''I k no wed that damn' branch wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isold," someone growled.

Suggs had one eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, watching everything, his toothless</seg><seg type="columnLine">face twisted sardonically, but he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get up. Kell Arbo w'atched Casson's flur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried preparations for some time, and fi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nally said; "Just what do you think you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">HANG-TRBE TRAIL</seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg><seg type="columnLine">goin' to do?" Kell glared down at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm pullin' out," Cassons answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm goin' home. Any objections?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well.

A sound fluttered on his lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but before he got it out his neck kinked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees buckled, and he went down like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shot horse.

"Give us time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't want no more of that." Arbo</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped. "And while we're at it I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well lay down a little law that goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">from now on.

Tott Crovet had his liberty so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could help with the herd, but he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get hack his gun, and he rode beat-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses so he wouldn't get far if he tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape. Everybody kept an eye on him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suggs especially. He had a rifle on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat beside him in the chuck wagon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">boasted lie meant to use it if Tott made</seg><seg type="columnLine">any kind of a move to slope out of there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now, the crew was split wide open</seg><seg type="columnLine">into two cliques, Kell Arbo and hi» three</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends against the rest, but what it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to Tott couldn't guess. Ever sine©</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night Arbo laid down the law the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Texans had been worked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven to death. Cap Andre was sick most</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time and let things go. Even if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his health he probably wouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up to Kell ArDo because the trail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ixiss could leave him flat and throw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a w'orse fix than he was in now. Tott</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have handled the drive, but it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have raised more commotion than there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now, and no one would have had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gall to ask him. He was living on bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed time, for a little while only.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Young Casson, the first to feel Kell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arbo's heavy hand, lost his life crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Canadian. Worn out with day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">night work, he went dowrn in quicksand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost his horse, and couldn't make it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore. It might have happened regard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, but Yorey blamed Kell Arbo, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had words about it. Now Bub Yorey</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting it in the neck. Arbo claimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was stirring up talk of deserting, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though so far Tott hadn't heard anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the kind. Day in and day out, he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yorey rode drag together, another thorn</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Yorey's flesh. He claimed it ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rotated, the way Cobb had done, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arbo wouldn't listen. One day, Tott</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him pointblank about the talk, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he denied it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll hear plenty of it, though, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds me much more." Yorey stated. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't give a damn what anybody says.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it won't be just talk either.

"Looks like rough country</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, Crovet," he remarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yorey scowled, and started to sputter</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the way Tott Crovet had been rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaded into this fix. "Hell, he was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold when we took a vote.

"Kinda yaller. Don't try to back</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, that's all I got to say." He had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">handful of raisins, a special treat for any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, and popped them into his mouth one</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one without offering them around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that's where Sugg's raisins went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to," Yorey exploded. "He's been belly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">achin' about 'em all over the place for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">week."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah," Arbo agreed coolly, "but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally got a hunch who tooken 'em,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yorey, so we went through your bedroll,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there they were."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My bedroll?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah.

He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like he was boiling mad. He went through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right motions, but Tott Crovet could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it was a show. It was something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was part of a plan, to stir up a commotion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and keep these young Texans in an up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar, picking on Yorey because he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ringleader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a smart little snot-nose," Arbo</seg><seg type="columnLine">HANG-TREE TRAIL</seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on with calculated contempt, "cuttin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">your fancy capers and makin' big talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">about pullin' out and takin' the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned crew with you if I didn't let up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You still got a lot to learn, and it won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">take me long to learn you. with a horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">whip.

He popped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last of the raisins into his mouth, wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers on his shirt, and rode off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yorey's face was white with rage.

It would be near dark. There would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be good horses on the picket line. If he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could manage to get himself a gun he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have a good chance, the only one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably, that would turn up before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the tree the next day. Arbo</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually had the Nolan boys and Red Um-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley throw a circle around camp to look for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Injun sign or whatever, and they seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">got back before dark, sometimes much</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, so old Suggs and Arbo himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the only ones to give him trouble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SUGGS pulled far ahead to make camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red Umley and the Nolan boys rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">off together to make their circle. A half</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour later, with evening shadows stretch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing horse and man to long stalking gaints,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arbo signaled to halt. Yorey didn't come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. He was making talk with all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends, here and there. Arbo didn't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">lo	notice. The herd, trail broke by now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave 110 trouble. A pond of water with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tules around the edges gave them drink.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tott saw Arbo ride across a stretch of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make sure cattle wouldn't bog down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tott headed for camp, speculating on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances of getting hold of Sugg's gun.

When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finished he stuck one end of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the iron loop at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon pole, hoisted the pole in the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolstering it with the wagon tongue, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied the loose end to a wheel. "If it busts</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll leave you choke to death," he snarled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">adding the whole list of pet names he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">accumulated for the cussed northerners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jo Andre tried to stop what he was do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, but he gave her a hard shove, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tott tried to add his warning.

Suggs lurched forward and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, his gun blazing wildly. Tott landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">running and jumped him before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">twist around. He kicked Suggs in the arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sent the gun flying. Then he put a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boot across Suggs' o*ck and held him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down like a snake under a pronged stick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jo Andre got some rope and tied the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire-eater's legs, wrapping it around like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bandage from his ankles to his knees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When she was finished Tott stepped back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaky with relief, and turned his back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her so she could cut the ropes from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.

Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked round and round the fire, stopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">every once in a while to take a hard kick</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the embers. There were eight of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AH of them had fire, and Tott was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised their auguring didn't flare up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a free-for-all fight. Yorey did some more</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking, and when he was through every*</seg><seg type="columnLine">one raised a hand.

"It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy Johnny Tighe, back after two years."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a yell of pain as the barber</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped and jammed his scissors into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">customer's scalp. "Easy Johnny!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurted out. He stood there for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, staring open-mouthed at the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">60</seg><seg type="columnLine">man before him. Slowly he laid down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scissors, snatched at the marble-topped</seg><seg type="columnLine">work table, came away opening a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">razor. The two customers stared, scram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled to back against the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Close-Cut! What's eatin' you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The barber advanced slowly. "Lafe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Durham was my friend for twenty years."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He held the razor out before him, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glint of steel no harder than the light in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes. "I'm goin' to carve you down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">killer. Easy Johnny was always too good</seg><seg type="columnLine">GRAB WEAPONS--OR WEEP!</seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg><seg type="columnLine">a name for you. You were just plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthless. Then back-gunnin' a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated you like his own son!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny backed to the door, a hurt look</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his gray eyes. "Close-Cut, T just come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in to get a shave and a haircut so 1 could</seg><seg type="columnLine">look good when 1 get out to see Lafe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--' He paused for a moment, added</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a calmer voice, "And Jeanne, too."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The barber inched forward, his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched until the knuckles were white on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the handle of the razor. "I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you get the nerve to come back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you sneakin' killer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny found himself backing to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boardwalk. The turn of events was enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make any man retreat. When a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes home after two years, after two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of proving to the wrorld that he is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jist stand steady. And Close-Cut,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack that razor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny felt it prodding into his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the muzzle of a six-gun could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">round and hard like that. And from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet voice, he knew it was Sheriff Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jenks. Slowly he turned. The oldster's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bristly white mustache was the same as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. But not his eyes. He had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen such burning hate in any man's eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it was Ben Jenks who taught him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast six-gun draw when he was just a kid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I don't get this, Sheriff. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll understand," the sheriff rasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. "You'll understand that you can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun the man who raised you like his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. Then cornin' back after two years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidin' out and actin' like you cxpect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatted calf to be killed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly it sank into Johnny's mind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lafe Durham wras dead. And that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, they thought he had done it. Auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matically his hand reached in the left shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket and dragged out a bag of makings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He rolled the cigaret without thinking, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he was too numbed to think.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jeanne," he said, "she's still---"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Still runnin' her daddy's ranch," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff said. "Runnin' it like a man. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man you never was. Now I'm goin' to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take that there Hogleg of yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny knew then that he had to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeanne. She would tell him. She wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think first with a razor or six-gun. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to have someone tell him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sheriff, give me two hours. Two hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'll come back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben Jenks snorted. "That's what you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">get. Two hours in jail before we hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny lit the cigaret, staring over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame into the oldster's face. What Jenks</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said seemed very likely. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang first, and then they'd ask questions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the sheriff's hand reaching for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun. Coming close to where his own hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. It had to be now. He stared out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the sheriff's shoulder, let his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop in apparent surprise. For a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jenks glanced away. In that second</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny clamped a range-hardened hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the oldster's wrist. With all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength he twisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aw--" gasped the oldster. He swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, the gun wide of its target. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumbed hammer, and lead crashed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorjamb. Johnny brought a boot up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. It slammed the gun nigh into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, and then the youngster was outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door, back against the wall, six-gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">leveled at the barber and sheriff. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">back for the hitchrope, untied it. Sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly he was vaulting into saddle. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben Jenks scoop up his six-gun. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wheeling his horse, cutting into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alley. A minute later he pounded across</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hangdog Creek and up through the Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE woods had looked like paradise</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he rode down from the bluff</seg><seg type="columnLine">that afternoon. All going red and gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">with autumn frosts. He remembered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time-he and Jeanne had been riding into</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, and all of a sudden he'd been over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come with the way the sunlight filtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through her hair and made it seem alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and golden. He'd hooked an arm out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled her to him. The horses seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand, and they closed up. He kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her then, and for a second she answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kiss. Then she was racing her pony</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Little Woods, and lie pounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">after her, laughing and shouting, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching her until they reached town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's the kind of harum-scarum Easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny Tighe was in those days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slapped the dun on the rump, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they cut up over Bull Bluff, through into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grasslands that fringed the Axe Head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Axe Head was the ridge that ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg><seg type="columnLine">10 STORY WESTERN MAGAZINE</seg><seg type="columnLine">through and up to the grasslands to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north. He was breathless when he got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top. All that had happened to him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocksalt was forgotten for the moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For Big Eight lay beyond Axe Head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grasslands made a two-mile sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the ranchhouse. Glossy green,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinged with brown from the frosts, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled gently to the right clear to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern arm of the Axe Head. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">south they were lost in the distance. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lowest part, where the little Jalco</seg><seg type="columnLine">River wound, was the windbreak of cot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonwoods, sprawling across the stream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were barns and log corrals, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted whiteness of the ranchhouse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny felt something tug inside of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he looked down there. He realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he hadn't come back just to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lafe Durham that he was a man. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back to the Big Eight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought of the time when he left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ever since his father died, Lafe had raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">him like his own son. Right along with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lafe's daughter Jeanne. They first</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed on a horse together, he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeanne. They learned to rope and cut out</seg><seg type="columnLine">calves, to spot market-size steers and tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">weights at a glance. Lafe promised that</seg><seg type="columnLine">someday his daughter and adopted son</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get equal shares in Big Eight. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plain too, that he hoped they wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">split it. He wanted them to marry when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came of age. He had made that</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was when Johnny took to gambling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Lafe really got mad. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">content to put up with Johnny's crazy kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricks. Johnny remembered the night Lafe</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come into the Rocksalt Saloon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him owing Ace Pracket three hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred -dollars, besides having lost his gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch and horn-handled six-gun. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody, Lafe blew off. "Tuh think I</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised a younker fer this!" he yelled. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled some more, too, and Johnny yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. He remembered shouting, "I'll even</seg><seg type="columnLine">up for this!" Then he was gone into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. He hit the saddle and rode, rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight south. At first he just tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember what caused the argument, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happened during it. Words like</seg><seg type="columnLine">"worthless pup." He vowed then to erase</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mark. He'd go out and make his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Then he'd come back and show the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oldster. He'd show him ten one-hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar bills. Show Lafe that he needed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">help from anyone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he had come back to this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny headed the pony down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope. A movement caught his eye. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">riders, up along the Axe Head. He turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pony back into some horse-high brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">to watch. They were trotting slowly. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he recognized the left-hand rider.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Golden hair flying in the wind, sitting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse as though she were part of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeanne! Johnny wheeled his pony, headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight for them. He saw Jeanne's blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes then, large and lustrous, and staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him as though he were a ghost. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock he recognized the other rider. Mel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Koles. A cowhand of Lafe's, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">left. A big man, though not as tall as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny, with black hair and a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustache. A handsome man, except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thin lips. They were just the outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that Johnny didn't like about Mel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kole. Others were the way he kow-towed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Lafe, and the soft, oily words he always</seg><seg type="columnLine">had for Jeanne.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spun his pony to a stop before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. "Johnny!" the girl cried. 'Johnny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've come back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to grin at her. There was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much emotion pent up in him. "I've come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back," he said. And he rasped out, "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">found my name smeared with mud."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has a lot of nerve," Mel Koles</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "A killer coming back to the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crime."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny lowered his head a little. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">go run and tell the sheriff I'm here, Kole."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kole glowered at him, lips a hard, thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny shot a glance at Jeanne. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a tear in her eye. "You don't be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve I did it, do you, Jeanne?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She sobbed. Slowly she brought her</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin up and looked him straight in the eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe you were a crazy youngster, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even worthless, like Dad said. But I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">never believe you killed him." She sobbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. "The evidence though, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the night he was killed, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody heard the argument, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying you'd get even--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny knew then how much he loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. His eyes were glued on her wet ones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he caught a glimpse of Mel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kole, a big hand streaking for gunbutt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny whirled but made no move for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">GRAB WEAPONS--OR WEEP!</seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg><seg type="columnLine">own gun. He stared into the man's face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Leave it, Kole." His eyes blazed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger. He rasped out flatly, "You aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mail enough to gun me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kole's hand stopped on gunbutt. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">measured his chances, glancing at John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ny's gun, at his rawboned hand resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily on the saddle horn. He blinked, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breath wheezed out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kole, get out of here unless you're</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to draw. But I say you're too yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low for that." His face wore an expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of contempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kole's eyes flicked up and down him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'll hang by tonight, boy," he growled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He cut his horse viciously to the left, rak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing spurs into its flanks. Johnny watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, looking back over his shoulder as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he expected a slug to come whin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at him. And Johnny remembered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mel Kole had one of the fastest draws he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever seen. And yet, he had been afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use it. Plainly, Johnny Tighe's return</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shaken him badly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why is he still here, Jeanne?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's my foreman." Her chin was up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her eyes showed the stubbornness Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lafe used to have. "You own half the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch, by dad's will. But I'm running it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at present, and I'll hire whoever I please."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stared at her, moved his horse clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er. "Do you believe I killed your dad?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes dropped. "Since Dad's death</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've been so alone, Johnny. With every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one saying you were always no good, I--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I--" Her voice trailed off. "Where've</seg><seg type="columnLine">you been, Johnny?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "California, Mexico. I've spent two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years proving I'm not what Lafe thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was." He pulled a money belt out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his shirt, drew out ten one-hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar bills. "These were to show Lafe."</seg><seg type="columnLine">His voice went bitter. "I suppose that</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing them now will look like they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen. Easy Johnny Tighe. Drygulcher."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She sat still looking at him, and the tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still in her eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So all of a sudden," he rasped, "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to prove I didn't kill Lafe. When did</seg><seg type="columnLine">it happen, Jeanne?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The night you left."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two years after the killing I've got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove I didn't do it 1 And with a hangrope</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridin' my backtrail." He moved his horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">over close to her, and his voice softened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"II you said you believed in me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeanne--" He looked straight into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She dodged his glance. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">started. Hoofs were rattapanning up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Axe Head. "The sheriff, Johnny! Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four men. They must have met Mel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kole!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny didn't look toward them. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't go until you tell me, Jeanne."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her eyes went wide with terror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're coming! Two hundred yards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've got to go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you believe in me?" He sat his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse quietly, back turned to the galloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsemen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her eyes darted around. "Yes! Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe in you.-Now go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny grinned. He swung an arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">around her, pulled her to him. He kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hard. As he drew his face away he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "I'll be back, Jeanne." Then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he was spurring along the Axe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Head, waving back to her. Mel Kole sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">two shots burning after him, but Easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny had cut out into the brush. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the posse had ridden hard. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse was rested and the climb up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Axe Head should put them behind. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced back, saw Sheriff Ben Jenks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kole, and two others. Kole seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding his horse back. Johnny grinned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kole's horse was the freshest, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid to lead the others by too much. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a heavy growth of jack-pines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slashed the pony through them. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to breathe the horse. Let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire their mounts, he thought. When they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had worked over his trail a while, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut them out and lead them off again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat there quietly, rolled a quirly. He told</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself they'd have a job catching Easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny Tighe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY came close later that afternoon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gave them a run, his jack-pines</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and lost them. When dark came</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had to give up. Johnny sat on a cleft</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rock up on the rim of the Axe Head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking. Below he could see a glimmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light at the ranchhouse. Inside, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching to see Jeanne. For one thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while she said she believed in him, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been hurried. Anything to make him</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave. But that meant she didn't want him</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed. One small comfort, anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew that no amount of earnest</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking would r«ally convince her. Talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg><seg type="columnLine">10 STORY WESTERN MAGAZINE</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it wouldn't convince anybody. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to find who murdered Lafe. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail was two years old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there he was bogged down. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that Lafe was killed the same night</seg><seg type="columnLine">he left. But no more than that. Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oldster had been carrying a sizeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">cash wad. Maybe someone had slipped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Lafe's past and done a job of vengence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At any rate, the murder was timed well</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put the blame on Easy Johnny Tighe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had to find out. And Jeanne was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only person he could trust. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged deep on his cigaret, crushed it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his bootheel. He hopped on his horse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a minute the pony was "plodding</seg><seg type="columnLine">down through the deep valley grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he came close he spotted a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the kitchen. Figuring on a possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap, he ran his horse into the far corral,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then slipped quietly around to the kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. Inside, he saw Jeanne, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the far wall, her arms folded. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow was puckered, and she was talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast to the four men seated at the kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. Jenks, Kole, and two men Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know. The window was closed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all he could get was the murmur of voices.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At length the four men got up and left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ldtchen. Johnnv slunk back in the bushes</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside the nouse. He watched them</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb into the saddle and head off toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When they were out of sight, he tapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the kitchen window. He saw Jeanne</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffen. Then she recovered and pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the front door. Johnny hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and into the house. He met her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dark hallway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think they might come back?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head. "Not now. We'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be*t -stay in the dark, though. They've</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to town to round up a big posse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Going to comb the range tor you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny shoved back the emotion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him want to put his arms around</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. With difficulty he managed to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member that he was in immediate danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said, "Jeanne, where was Mel Kole</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night Lafe was killed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She frowned. "Why, he was with Dad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw--" She stopped, suddenly broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">into hurried words.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced over at Close-Cut Pete's barber</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop. His eyes lit up.

Throughout a vast region</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no wagon road*, no bridges</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the rivers; just narrow, often dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous trails, zigzagging back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">across mountains, stringing along steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs, or crossing and recrossing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, following always the line of least</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far-seeing merchants placed stores at</seg><seg type="columnLine">convenient locations, and equipped pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">trains of from thirty to 60 or more mules</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to pack everything from food, dynamite</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kegs of whiskey to quartz mill ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinery, saw mill parts and hydraulic</seg><seg type="columnLine">monitors. A first class outfit was supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to average 300 pounds to the animal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These mules were carefully picked--usu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally of the block}' type and weighing</seg><seg type="columnLine">around 900 to 1100 pounds. They had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be good walkers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A packer just had to be GOOD or he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no good at all. He had to be quick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">active, strong, and use good judgment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything about handling freight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">systematized. Packages of ordinary freight</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be lashed together in side packs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">around 150 pounds each, and the "cargo"</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveniently arranged for rapid work in</seg><seg type="columnLine">loading. Three good men and a "bell boy"</seg><seg type="columnLine">could handle a train of around 30 to 40</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg><seg type="columnLine">IRVING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The work of packing begun, the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to be loaded and moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">within an hour. You couldn't keep an ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal standing around for two or three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours with a 300 pound pack on his back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Packers had to be expert saddlers. A dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanket or an overlooked crease could</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause a saddle sore. Each saddle tree waj</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjusted to fit the individual animal. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack had to balance perfectly, else it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn and pile the pack and animal down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some canyon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ever}' good outfit had reserved a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most intelligent and strongest ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals for "top packs." These top packs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were single pieces of machinery, stoves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunks, or what-not too heavy for side</seg><seg type="columnLine">packs. Often a section of a stamp mill</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortar, or an hydraulic monitor would</seg><seg type="columnLine">weigh 350 pounds or better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the handling of such pieces pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">train owners often demanded full insur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance on the value of the animal before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would touch them. To handle these top</seg><seg type="columnLine">packs, a piece of wood would be lashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on each side of the saddle and even with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the tree forks. This made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">base for the pack to rest on. An abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely expert job had to be done on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy top pack. Perfect balance was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perative and the job had to be done fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gold mines had a habit of locating them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves in the most inaccessible regions;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in such impossible places most of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">packs had to go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A good pack outfit was well trained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Undesirable animals were soon weeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Mules for some unexplainable reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">will follow a gray mare to hell and back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The custom was to put a bell on the mare</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ride her in the lead. The mules soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">got used to the sound of the bell and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow as long as they could hear it. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">night when the animals were turned loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gaze they seldom strayed beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of the bell. In the morning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ARTISTS OF THE DIAMOND HITCH</seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick was to catch the mare, and the mules</seg><seg type="columnLine">would follow he'r to camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saddles in camp were placed in a semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle. And while the "bell boy" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooking breakfast the gray mare would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be led to the "near" end of the semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle on the outside. Each mule would</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd in along-side, heads over the sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dles. The packer from the inside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">semi-circle would place slip halters on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mules' heads. They would then be tied to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether for saddling. With breakfast over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the packing starts. Two men on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"near" side deftly swing up the 150</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound side pack to rest on tree forks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle. The man on the "off" side</seg><seg type="columnLine">swings a loop around it; pulls it over on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own side and steadies it. The end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sling rope is thrown over and tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the near side. "Walk him," says</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boss. The mule is led a few steps to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that the pack is balanced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now comes the art of throwing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous Diamond Hitch. The lash rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems almost a living thing--no lost mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Every move counts. With the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamond-hitch artist the rope fairly sings!</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few incredibly quick movements and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing is done in less than a minute--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pack securely lashed to all four comers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pack saddle and under the animal's</seg><seg type="columnLine">belly. When finished, a diamond shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">design shows in the rope on top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack--hence the "diamond hitch." In less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than an hour the packing is done; the bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy has packed his "kitchen" and is on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail riding the mare. The loaded train</seg><seg type="columnLine">is on its way. Around 15 miles was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered a day under heavy packs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A mule is a most intelligent pack animal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He may be full up to the neck with cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sedness. He may kick your eyebrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. But he knows how to take care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself--and does! You can't get him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dangerous bridge or in miry ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he can't go around or jump a danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous place he just won't go at all. He will</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel a narrow, dizzy trail around some</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost perpendicular cliff or canyon wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he must have clearance for his pack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just a few inches clearance is enough in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order that he can keep his pack from</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking an obstruction and hurtling him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his pack to destruction. A good boss</seg><seg type="columnLine">packer always looked out for this and</seg><seg type="columnLine">never put his loaded train on a trail unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sure of sufficient clearance for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">packs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pack trains in the days of the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">West were used to pack flume and build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lumber; also mining timbers. Pack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing boards 12 to 16 feet in length was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">"great shakes" at all. For packing lum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, racks were suspended on either side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the saddle from the tree forks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wooden pins were adjusted to rest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumber on. With one-inch lumber, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front ends were tied together. A loop</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slung over the rear ends and drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight. Then again would come the inevi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table diamond hitch. The load would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">semble an inverted row boat over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"deck" of the mule. The intelligence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mules in carrying lumber through rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broken country was nothing short of</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With perhaps only a width of 12 to 18</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches for his hoofs, and in steep country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had no way to recover from a jar. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be just a "gone duck." But here is</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the mule really used his intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence to save himself. If, in a tight place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where there would be danger of the lum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber striking an obstruction close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail, he would keep his eyes "peeled."</seg><seg type="columnLine">With greatest of care he would swing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end clear and ease himself around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous spot, keeping as close as safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">would permit to the outer edge of the trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in no case would he get careless in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a situation dangerous to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He might for some reason of pure, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">adulterated cussedness try to rub off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack by going between two trees; but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be on level ground and involve</seg><seg type="columnLine">no danger to his personal safety ! To climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steep grade with a heavy top pack re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired some careful work too. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk steady, head well down, lest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pack pull him over backwards. A horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">might throw up his head to look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scenery, but never a mule.

The boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to a beautiful hand-made cedar</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest and asked Mike how much it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That'll only cost you a nickel!" the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider spoke up, glaring fiercely at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled old man behind the counter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Mike's mouth popped wide as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at the young stranger, and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, a grin touched the far corners of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes.

His keen old eyes rested briefly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stranger's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ahuh!" The rider shifted his weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one long leg, deftly tipped his hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down over his eyes, and let his hand fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mike's stooping shoulder. "I reckon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said gravely, "that we'll have a penny's</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth of candy, about five or ten pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed. Be sure to give us some of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">kinds. And we'll have another penny's</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth of mixed nuts, about the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount. And we'll have a couple dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">oranges and some bananas, if you got</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em, and a big Ik&gt;x of those fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">chocolates for Mom, huh.

That about finishes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dime, Bud. Is there anythin' else you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gosh, no!" the little fellow gasped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with shining eyes. "How we gonna get</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this home?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim Bailey's up the street a ways with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his buckboard," Mike suggested, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">vainly to keep his exultation from show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. "He'll take you home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Big, hearty Jim Bailey was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to take the kid home.

That individual flushed deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only said, "Give me a hand here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gosh!" the kid squealed. "I'll bet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mom doesn't know you can get all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">much stuff for a dime!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll bet you wouldn't either if you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen a dime before," said Jim Bailey</seg><seg type="columnLine">quizzically.

"I ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with my Christmas shoppin' yet."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I got somethin' here," said Mike, run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning a guilty eye over his store, "that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful good for your Christmas spirit."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pulled a bottle from under the ooun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter and shoved it across.

"We can strap it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this.

Then the puncher, fastening the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of hi* shortened lariat onto the sled</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a tow rope, took a couple of dallies</seg><seg type="columnLine">J2</seg><seg type="columnLine">10 STORY WESTERN MAGAZINE</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the saddle horn and swung up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mike advanced and placed an affec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionate hand on the rider's knee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boy, I don't know what to say to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," he stammered.

"Only female I ever found," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawled, "who don't talk back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following the directions given him, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rider jogged reluctantly past the humming</seg><seg type="columnLine">saloon and was soon out of town and 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way to the little cabin.

The fireplace was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing lustily. The cedar chest was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center of the floor. On a table with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reach of the tree were heaping dishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of candy, nuts, and fruit; and a dog was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting beside the table looking expectantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the exuberant couple to the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled dishes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man on the outside suddenly choked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over an obstruction in his throat.

And Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knight would be with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow, Bill did not feel the awe he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had expected as he watched Kane Outler</seg><seg type="columnLine">step down from the stage a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">later. The marshal was tall, lean and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a still, flowing movement like a boa con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strictor that Bill had once seen in a circus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were a gray-blue with shreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern ice, never melting. They gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Knight an unpleasant shock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kane Outler's eyes didn't dart and stab,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but went in an easy sweep that missed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail, an indefinite stare. His white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender hands were still with latent power</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the broad belt that supported the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous stag handled Colts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Bill Knight stepped forward, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">received the full force of Outler's eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bill's lifting hand dropped back. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively knew that Outler would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake hands now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm Bill Knight, Mr. Outler. Welcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Watergap." As Outler nodded briefly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill went on with unaccountable lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiasm. "I've taken the liberty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserve you a room in the Watergap Hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">--upstairs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outler nodded again. "We'll go up</seg><seg type="columnLine">then," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Bill Knight paced Outler through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lobby, skirted the bar and climbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs to Outler's room, Marie's words</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept prodding him. With different eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he noted the gunman's encompassing</seg><seg type="columnLine">glances that missed nobody, weighed each</seg><seg type="columnLine">man they approached, those slender hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">still and ready. The tension crept into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Knight, the shuddery feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry guns waiting, waiting .</seg><seg type="columnLine">KANE OUTLER did not relax in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room either, he never turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Bill Knight as he investigated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">closet and looked under the bed. Bill tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to conceal his surprise but knew that Out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler had noted it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outler said without humor, coldly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'll learn, Knight--if you live. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man take a shot at me from under a bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. Luckily I had tired of sleeping on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straw bed and I'd had a cotton mattress</seg><seg type="columnLine">put on the day before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Knight felt uneasy, a little choked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wished they were already on tomor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row's stage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it was no better in bed later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Around midnight, after tossing for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, Bill Knight got up and dressed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe a long walk would tire him enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep. Hell of a Dodge City marshal</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd make, foggy with sleepless nights . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spotted the two strangers at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar, standing apart from the thinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd. From habit, he started toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Then lie remembered he was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer marshal here, and shrugging, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. But his thoughts kept returning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, the pale eyes, that he had glimpsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mirror, of one, the bulging, frog</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of the other. The crossed catridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">belts. Gunmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were still in the nearly deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar when he returned two hours later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill turned through the bar and Curley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">TRUST A DEAD MAN</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bartender got off his stool and poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a drink. He was raisin? it to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips when the two moved up beside him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one on either side, suddenly, smoothly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Under their stare, Curley moved back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're Bill Knight?" asked Pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You and Outler figger to leave for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dodge tomorrow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Man needs money in Dodge," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pale Eyes. "I know where you can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of money. Five hundred. Ain't that</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, Frog?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he co-operated he could," agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frog. "And was real smart. He might</seg><seg type="columnLine">even get to be marshal of Dodge hisself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If Kane Outler was dead, that is,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Pale Eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Knight knew the tight he was in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he refused to help them kill Kane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outler, they wouldn't allow him to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell the marshal. If he agreed, he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the badman's marshal of Dodge . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Knight set his glass down carefully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were pressing closer then, pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning his arms just enough without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">too obvious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had him. Bill Knight knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lifted his eyes to the mirror, better to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see them both. Unbelievingly then, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared into the mirror, seeing the lean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful figure just inside the door. Kane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outler's cold eyes were wide and glaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, and his white hands hovered over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stag handled Colts that showed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleached bones from the pushed back coat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that tension charged moment, Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knight knew, clearly and without doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Outler had been. He had been fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing Bill Knight. The wolf in him had</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt Bill Knight's unease, that animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct suspecting a trap and those glaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes now told Bill that he stood convicted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with those other two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Knight knew that those hungry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stag handled guns would make no dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctions. His life hung by a slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These two are out to kill you, Outler,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill said clearly. "They tried to ring me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in on it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, damn you--" began Pale Eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Knight shoved with his arms sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, hard, then went in a long dive along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sawdust floor, hands stretched above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. "They're yours, Outler!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his words were drowned.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kane Outler's lead was skimming over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Knight and the saloon rocked to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder of those famous guns. Frog died</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his gun half out of leather, and Pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eyes followed him so close that they fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">together with the dying Pale Eyes squeez-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off a shot into the sawdust floor. •</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly then some of the fearful tension</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran out of Outler and the guns sagged al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most imperceptibly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those men have followed me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Santone," Outler said finally, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">an even monotone. "They were hired to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill me by a certain element in Dodge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They could and would have made it in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting to anyone who helped them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">His cold eyes bored into Bill Knight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," said Bill Knight and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own even speech astonished him. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered me five hundred. I was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight." He stood up and looked at Out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler. "You followed me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Just to make sure why you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowling around after going to bed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no apology in Outler's toneless</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "Don't make it a habit to worry me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knight." For a second the glare was back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then it was gone and he holstered his guns.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get a pattern and no impulses, under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah, I understand, or I am beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to, anyway. Marie understood before ana</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was right." He knew now that Kane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outler was killer first, lawman second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" snapped Outler. "Who's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marie?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My girl," said Bill Knight. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated softly, "My girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then under Outler's stare, Bill Knight</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbuckled his gunbelt and tossed it oh</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar. "Curley," he said gently, "a</seg><seg type="columnLine">present for you. I won't need it in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hay and feed business!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked past Kane Outler and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door into the street.

With a fresh stake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved on to St. Louis. In 1831 the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mississippi River port, ten miles from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the Missouri, was the Western</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital for the fur trade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gant &amp; Blackwell were outfitting an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition to the Northwest, and Leonard</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined them.

Leon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard, however, wanted to try again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">4m Intrepid young frontiersman took</seg><seg type="columnLine">•even men and set forth.

During the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack, Leonard crawled on his hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees and dragged a wounded comrade</seg><seg type="columnLine">to safety, after which he returned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fray and fought until the invaders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">routed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a man of action, always wanting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be on the move, and when Capt.

Negro slaves in the Southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">States saw that heavenly display also, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to their knees in terror, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was "the year the stars fell."</seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER all this, the men were ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a drink or two, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">afforded all they wanted when they reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northern arm of San Francisco Bay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a ship lay at anchor. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lagoda, from Boston, and Captain Brad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaw, its master, invited the explorers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come aboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have a few casks of cognac that need</seg><seg type="columnLine">sampling," he told them with a smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a long trip around the Horn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a hard trip across the Sierras,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, and the sailors and "landlubber"</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain men drank and fraternized for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several day*. Walker's men spent several</seg><seg type="columnLine">months visiting the Spaniards in San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jose, San Juan and Monterrey. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring of 1834 they began the return</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip, which wasn't quite as tough, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad enough. They rejoined Bonneville</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Great Salt Lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As in yeart gone by, the brigade was</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken up into smaller groups for trap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping purposes.

Chief of the Lipans, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">branch of the far-flung Apaches, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xolic, who led his people on a bartering</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition to San Antonio every six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, taking along a small amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver bullion for that purpose.

One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these was James Bowie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As part of his campaign to win the</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship of the Lipans he presented a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine silver-plated rifle, imported from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east, to Chief Xolic. After a powwow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowie became a member of the tribe in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ceremony at San Pedro Springs. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the months that followed he became adept</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hunting buffalo ,and battling enemies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tribe. In fact, he became such a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior and brave that his patience and</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts were rewarded by a peek into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe's treasure trove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bowie was amazed at what he saw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">79</seg><seg type="columnLine">so</seg><seg type="columnLine">10 STORY WESiERN MAGAZINE</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whether it was a great storehouse full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelted bullion or natural veins of ore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mattered little.

He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner learned the secret than he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave of the tribe and headed for San An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonio.

It nearly cost him his life. too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So much for the "off-the-record" ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count. Another version of the same story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has some historical basis, relates</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Bowie, with ten other men, including</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brother, Rezin P. Bowie, set out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expedition to locate the lost Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">mines on November 2, 1831. Among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others was Cephas K. Ham, who played an</seg><seg type="columnLine">important part in the explorations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both accounts claimed that James Bowie</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in the San Saba country before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for gold and silver, but if he had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted mighty queer for one who apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew where he was going. So much time</seg><seg type="columnLine">was consumed in "examining the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country," as he put it, that he hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived at the abandoned fort on the San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saba after more than two weeks in spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fact that it was but a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty miles from San Antonio.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1THE site of the old presidio was thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">•	to have been only a mile from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mines, and was the main target of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition. Why did Jim Bowie wander</seg><seg type="columnLine">for nearly three weeks? Did he have other</seg><seg type="columnLine">information ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were told by a friendly Coman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">che on November 19 that hostile savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the vicinity. For the most part</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were Tehuacanas, Caddo1-- and Wacos.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whether Three Hands and his Lipans</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the war party was not learned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They struck at dawn on the 21st--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and sixty-four strong, or about</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen to one, but the Bowie camp wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught napping. In fact they had forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight hours to prepare for the assault.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The battle raged all day. Fifty redskins</seg><seg type="columnLine">were killed and thirty-five wounded. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">Texan was dead and three were wounded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But most of the mine hunters' horses were</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed or crippled, and they remained in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp for another week licking their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounds. One of the men, by the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buchanan, was badly wounded in the leg,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they "boiled some live oak bark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickened it with powdered charcoal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian meal, made a poultice of it and tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">it around Buchanan's leg." A piece of buf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">falo skin was sewed around the bandage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His recovery was rapid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time hung heavily on their hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the period of convalescence some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the able bodied members of the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a cave near the camp, which served</seg><seg type="columnLine">to place the location of the battle about</seg><seg type="columnLine">six miles east of the presidio, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five miles east, as was generally be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved. It took them ten days to limp</seg><seg type="columnLine">hack to San Antonio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> According to Cephas Ham, he--not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowie--was adopted by Indians, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Comanches, not Lipans, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief was Incorroy. He was on horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">trading expeditions with the tribe in 1831,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he almost saw the mine. The price</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a good horse was two brass rings, eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">balls of lead, a pint of powder, a butcher</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife and a plug of tobacco, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught mustangs and drove them to Loui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of Ham's hunting companions was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fat warrior. One day he took the Texan</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Plenty silver other side," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing to a hill. "We go alone. I show</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. But others mustn't know. They kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fat brave was unable to keep his</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise, however, for the camp moved on</seg><seg type="columnLine">next day. Then Ham received a message</seg><seg type="columnLine">from James Bowie saying that the Mexi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans and Comanches were on the verge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">war. When he arrived in San Antonio</seg><seg type="columnLine">he learned that the real purpose of Bowie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning was to enlist Ham's aid in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for the San Saba treasure. The ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedition then took its departure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rezin P. Bowie had already been to</seg><seg type="columnLine">TREASURE OF SAN SABA</seg><seg type="columnLine">81</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mine," Ham said. "It wasn't far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fort. Rezin descended to the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the eight-foot shaft on steps hewn from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an oak log. With his tomahawk he hacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">off some ore and took it to New Orleans</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the assay showed it to be of excel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent quality." Fie returned to San Antonio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his further moves were chronicled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "historical" account of the expedition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Bowie did not give up the search,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however. Jason was no more persistent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his quest of the Golden Fleece than this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Bowie. He raised a second expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of thirty men, all authorities agree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This time, according to Ham, he got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the San Saba but failed to find the shaft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been filled up. However, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have found it, and was getting ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to develop it when the war between Texas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mexico broke out. Many Texans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, were insistent in their belief that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowie's real motive for getting hold of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Saba wealth was to help finance the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Texas army in its battle for independence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One authority believed that the Lipans</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed Bowie several hundred jack loads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pure silver that had been moulded into</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars and stored in a cave, instead of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine. There also is a story that five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred dollars was paid to a Mexican for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">document that one of Santa Anna's officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">took from the dead body of Jim Bowie in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Alamo. It purportedly gave directions</seg><seg type="columnLine">for finding the mine. But for some r*ason</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other the purchaser was unable to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Be that as it may, many believe to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this day that Bowie died on that 6th day</seg><seg type="columnLine">of March, 1836, knowing where untold</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth was hidden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Out of all this welter of fact and fiction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seems that Jim Bowie set out for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mines, all right, and must have known</seg><seg type="columnLine">its location, for his name appears on two</seg><seg type="columnLine">different stone gateposts of the old stock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ade ruins on the San Saba.

Don't mind, do you, son ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bristow shrugged his shoulders, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes half closed now against the glare of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight in the street. "Not any, Sheriff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In about a half hour. That all right?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Limes glanced down the street, the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of uneasiness in his eyes. "Why, no," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, then murmured, "Ral, Clyde Tunis</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the dirtiest fighter in the country!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He'd be dead by now if he wasn't,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Bristow with a flickering smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Sheriff lowered his arm, his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ral, I can't let a gun-fight happen.

Their eyes met, fair and direct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was a slim fair girl of twenty-five,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight-standing, well-formed of body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb, a girl who, in a land where most</seg><seg type="columnLine">women lost their allure, managed always</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look fresh and sweet in the simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">things she wore. Today she was dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a plain gingham frock cut low enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show her softly rounded throat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gentle curves of shoulders and breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, very softly: "Ral, you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">an easy-going man.

Come in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed her through the doorway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she faced him in a room that held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, a sewing machine and the neat dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">order of a dress-maker's workship. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched a bolt of yard goods from an</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy chair and made a place for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sit. But he remained standing; the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows of the room made the chiseled angles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his dark face stronger. His gaze stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly on hers.

The bed looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, but he slept on the floor, after pull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the tick into a corner out of range of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window. He knew about what to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect of Tunis and his rough-head crew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Sheriff had warned him.

At three o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">•ome outside sound awakened him. He got</seg><seg type="columnLine">oB the floor, hand on his gun, and Hftsd</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window shade, peering out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper gallery but seeing no one. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard the voices in the street below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stepped through the open window and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the railing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His own spring wagon and team of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks stood before the hotel.

Here was the main drag ly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bright with afternoon sunlight on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rusty-colored dust, and on the saddles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rows of ranch horses. A group of rid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers and townsmen had gathered before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel, and others were hurrying up under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arcades, drawn by the sight of a bawl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing brindle calf that had been tied to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitch rail close to a brindle cow's fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming hide that still dripped blacken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd was staring at the fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">brand on the calf--a plainly marked blot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting job that represented the Crossbone</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Clyde Tunis. But the brand on the hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">draped over the rail was Bristow's B-Bar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmistakably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">AS BRISTOW came up, Clint Osburn</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a nerved-up grin that</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed his broken teeth. "Keep cool, son!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here they come now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down the street three men were strid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward the scene before the hotel--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luckinbill, Lefever, Dawkins. Behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, dimly seen on the gallery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shindy Bar, sat Tunis and two other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crossbone men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hipe Luckinbill and the two gun-slam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer* butted their way through the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">HOT BLOOD BRANDS THE CROSSBONE</seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg><seg type="columnLine">and halted, all the three staring incredu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lously at the blatting calf and the hide of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bristow !" Hipe's voice was harsh with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger. His eyes were only streaks against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coffee-colored toughness of his face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's this damned foolishness about?</seg><seg type="columnLine">If it's got anything to do with Crossbone</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want it stopped!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bristow stood with his back to the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch railing. He felt steady and cold; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of deadly amusement glittered in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's it look like, Hipe? Come on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see for yourself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trouble had reached its climax here</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the crowd, and that was the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bristow had planned it. He had kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">business of the calf and its mother's hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself and to the members of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew. Consequently the dramatic impact</seg><seg type="columnLine">was explosive. Here before the crowd, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore part of the Crossbone crew, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat, indisputable proof of Clyde Tunis'</seg><seg type="columnLine">nefarious activities against B-Bar. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crossbone-brandcd calf bawling so mourn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully at the hide of a B-Bar cow was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the evidence needed to run Clyde</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tunis and his rowdies out of town, out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the country, out of the State.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up the street a woman's voice cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Somebody get the Sheriff! Stop them</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the shooting starts!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cry had a steadying, sobering ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect on the tempers of Hipe and his men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Hipe's leathery face worked in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitching way that told of his inward fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">and discomfiture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bristow's greenish eyes squinted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt. He said, slowly, carefully, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">With anger: "There's the proof. That B-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bar cow was shot! There's her hide!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's the calf wearin' your brand! If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've got anything to say, make vour</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hipe swallowed hard. His slitted gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung from side to side, seeing the grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks on the faces of the crowd, seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bleak triumph on Bristow's, the watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful wariness on those of the B-Bar crew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he snarled an oath and wheeled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striding furiously back toward the Shindy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bar. Lefever and Dawkins hung back a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, eyeing Bristow in a hungry way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then they, too, whirled and walked away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd began to disperse, murmur -</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously. In the crowd, Bristow knew full</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, were a few of Clyde Tunis' friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now they would keep silent about any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathy they might hold for the Cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone boss. The business of the hide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the calf had accomplished this much--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had driven Bristow's enemies to cover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for Tunis and his crew. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be out after his scalp within a mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of hours. And there would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot-out Bristow wanted before another</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn. He was ready for that fight, actu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally welcomed it, for it was the only sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of putting an end to rustling in High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Valley, the only way of heading off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own eventual bankruptcy and ruin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">IN ODDFELLOWS' Hall, a block</seg><seg type="columnLine">north of the hotel, the fiddles and gui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tars had started up and there rose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long many-windowed building the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds of scraping feet moving in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythm of a waltz, of young girls' tittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter, the maturer laughter of women</seg><seg type="columnLine">and men caught up in the keen excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he left his room in the hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bristow went to a restaurant across from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the livery stable and had his supper with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the B-Bar crew. The four men ate in si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence, but each man had his instructions</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the evening. When they finished the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal and Bristow paid the bill, they left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one at a time, and took up prearranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">positions along the four-block street, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were immediately lost to view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bristow was the last to leave the res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taurant.

Yonder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the hotel, was vague movement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those two still waited in the dark, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, perhaps with guns still gripped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bristow didn't wait for the Sheriff to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the scene. He went back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows and found Lacey waiting, a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting on his gun, an ugly scowl on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">leathery face. "Bob," said Bristow, "find</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam and keep watchin' the street. I'm go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ' after Tunis!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside the hall the hand began again, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">half the crowd was pushing out through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open doors, cautious, staring, wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. And then a slender figure came run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning through the shadows. It was Verna</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rending, her hair disarranged. Bristow's</seg><seg type="columnLine">name on her lips in a low, choked cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ral!" she said. "Will Pardee left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall by the back door! He--had a revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bristow gripped her by the arms, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face stern, almost forbidding in its savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmness. "Verna, go back inside! Stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">there till I come for you" That was all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he wheeled and started down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His right elbow broke upward. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand lay against the coolness of his gun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone butt. As he walked, he cocked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer over a live shell and left it cocked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard brisk movement under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened arcade a hundred feet ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He ducked aside and moved along</seg><seg type="columnLine">n the dark against the building fronts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The last few lights in stores had gone out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinguished as by swiftly flattened hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A stock train's staccato stack thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">wai coming up Frevert'i Grade a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">east of town. The sound increasingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the night, then the engine's whistle</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed for the lower crossing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bristow reached the corner of the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there halted, flat against the gallery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gaze swinging. This was the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had seen the first two glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends of cigarettes. There was a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage running rearward beside the hotel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He entered it and made his way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness as deep as that in a mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then ahead of him in the hotel's rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter someone fell over a barrel of emp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty food tins. The clatter was brief but</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it he heard a man softly cursing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He quickened his pace and broke out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear yard, fully halted, his gun drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ready against his thigh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He caught the movement of a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps two. ducking hack toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street through another alley to the south.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a silence so profound he was aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thud of his own boots on the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bristow ran toward that alley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the alley's darkness was split</seg><seg type="columnLine">asunder by the stabbing flash of a six-gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired at him. The bullet slapped a shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him and the crash of the shot left</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears ringing and half deaf. He flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened himself to the ground, raising his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon, then lowering it. He heard boots</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spurs clanking at a run toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was up and pursuing instantly, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">very wary now, his night eyes working</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last. His guess was that someone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">baiting him farther from the heart of</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, perhaps somewhere near the cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens where he would be cornered by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole Crossbone crew and shot down like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled savagely to himself at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. He had no intention of continu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this game of fox and hounds. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he came sliding out of the alley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit the street, he tried to put himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tunis' boots. And, in that space of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short-drawn breath, he made his guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he would find the man he meant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Staring toward the railroad depot some</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred yards away, he saw two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men moving surreptitiously away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him beneath the overhead wooden awn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. Every few feet, this pair hesitated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused, and stared back toward him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg><seg type="columnLine">10 STORY WESTERN MAGAZINE</seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was only one splash of light at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this end of town. It came under and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the batwing blinds of the Shindy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bar, about a hundred feet away. Bristow</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced back toward the Hall and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd that now was standing in the street.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With earn gripped in a sweating palm, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked to the next alley, ducked into it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then ran swiftly to the rear yards once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seconds later, he came behind the sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loon, found a door that was unlocked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let himself into a rank-smelling passage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. At the street end of it, a sliver of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow light gleamed down low against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. He went toward it, left hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushing the passage wall, his boots mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing scarcely any sound. He reached an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other door, patently leading into the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. There was the muffled rumble of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men's voices beyond the panel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found the door knob, gave it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">twist, flung the door inward violently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked himself with slittod eyes, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the room with two long strides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were five men in the room, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">har, a pallid-faced barkeeper behind it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bristow saw Clyde Tunis standing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far end, his back to the doors which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been closed and bolted against the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next to Tunis stood Will Pardee, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">next to Pardee were three Crossbone gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, their backs turned to Bristow.

Their faces swam into</seg><seg type="columnLine">focus, and Tunis stiffened, shock in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring eyes. Will Pardee glanced over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder and then froze motionless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His frock coat and white shirt looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">incongruous here beside the sweaty, dusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding garb of his companions. The three</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunmen, caught flat-footed by surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinked and started raising arms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands to shoulder height.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bristow stood spread-legged near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. He held his gun straight-armed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him ; his expression was unreadable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His keen eyes saw the bartender bend</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously,. reaching with a furtive gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath his bar.

All</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk had died. Outside was the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men running the walks, then came scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered shots, and a voice yelled in unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clyde Tunis recovered himself like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man shocked awake. His big boot slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the brass rail and thudded dully to th*</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. His spur chimed once. Bristow</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't speak for a moment, only stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tunis, the other men also bracketed In Hs</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze. Then he said, very softly: "Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, Tunis 1 I'm givin' you the draw!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tunis hadn't expected this. Tiny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinkling beads of sweat showed on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reddened cheeks.

And so Bristow was compelled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauge the others and try to guess which</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would draw and fire the second he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw his gun on Tunis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the Crossbone boss, he said in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin-lipped way: "Make your draw!

A third followed as Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dee pulled a parlor gun from his vest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took snap aim at Bristow, letting go. Bris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tow's hat jerked on his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tunis was going down, bent double, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-gun falling to the floor, his face twist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in agony. There was a bullet in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow under Bristow's shoulder bone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The impact knocked him back a pace. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Pardee's lead that had hit him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And even as he swung his gun on Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dee, the dark man fired again, though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet sliced through Bristow's shirt be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween elbow and ribs. He had to silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that derringer, for if he fell, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pardee would fire again and again into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">prone body, would end his life in the sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loon's sawdust and a pool of blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bristow let go with his second shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not aiming, not pulling the trigger, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapping the hammer back and letting it</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall against the nested shell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard and saw the bullet slug into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pardee's chest and stagger him around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bristow fired again.
