We drift farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the old idea of man as the chief end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of creation. To the savage, the universe is his</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley, with the heavens arching low overhead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and himself, supreme. Sciencc has found a mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion new worlds, and lost itself in them. Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">has become a cosmic mote; man, utterly ephem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral and insignificant. Science and Intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone remain considerable quantities. Then, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the life of the earth is the briefest instant in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Time, a question rises: Must man pass with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, or will Human Intelligence rule on, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new factor in the universe ? The idea is stupend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous. Science is the doorway to the future; scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tifiction, the golden key.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chief function of scientifiction is the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of real pictures of new things, new ideas, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">new machines. Scientifiction is the product of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human imagination, guided by the suggestion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science. It takes the basis of science, considers</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the clues that science has to offer, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">adds a thing that is alien to science--imagination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It goes ahead and lights the way. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciencc sees the things made real in the author's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, it makes them real indeed. It deals only</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that which it can sec, or weigh, or measure;</seg><seg type="columnLine">only with logical hypothesis, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment and influence and cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culation. Scientifiction begins</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ending of science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The realization of scicntific-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is proverbial. Science has</seg><seg type="columnLine">made hardly a single step that</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientifiction has not foretold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And science, in return, has dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed a million new and start-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ling facts, to serve as wings for the scientifiction</seg><seg type="columnLine">author's brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scientifiction takes a thousand accumulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts and builds them into a real, impressive pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of ages past, whereby the future of the race</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be foretold. It mounts a Time Machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ventures through futurity, revealing the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults of known conditions and tendencies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Science knows that life on other worlds is pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, but it remains for scientifiction to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision real, and to suggest the space flier to verify</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Then science may build the flier, and see for</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself. The boundless energy of the atom, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fourth Dimension, the sub-universe below and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the super-universe above, arc scientific absurdities</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, until scientifiction gives them reality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And sciencc goes on, with scicntifictio'n as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlight. Here is the picture, if we can but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it. A universe ruled by the human mind. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">new Golden Age of fair cities, of new laws and</seg><seg type="columnLine">new machines, of human capabilities undreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of, of a civilization that has conquered matter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nature, distance and time, disease and death. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious picture of an empire that lies away past</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million flaming suns until it reaches the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinity of unknown space, and extends beyond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The picture is incredible to us now.

Doctor Benjamin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henden was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best known) scientists in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States, or in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world for that mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. Although a compar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atively young man at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he departed--he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his early fifties--yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had won international</seg><seg type="columnLine">fame in several branches of natural science. He was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent geologist, something of a botanist, and pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed a far greater knowledge of zoology than many</seg><seg type="columnLine">professors of that science. In his early youth he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">436</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vary soon tho fir* waa blazing, and os the flames lit up the shadowy forest and tho pungent smoke drifted upward through the trees, WO OOOii</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that we had crcatcd a most unpleasant situation for ourselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">437</seg><seg type="columnLine">438</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">specialized in ornithology and later in entomology, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the pursuit of these studies he had made a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of very successful expeditions to South and Central</seg><seg type="columnLine">America, securing on these trips vast numbers of rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens and many new species. It is scarcely exag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerating to say that Doctor Henden had a more inti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate first hand knowledge of tropical American bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">and insect life than any man of his time. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon these expeditions to which I refer that Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henden's interest was aroused by the aboriginal tribes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of South and Central America and by the innumer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able remains of past civilization in those countries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So absorbed did he become in these matters, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely forsook ornithology and entomology and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came an ardent student of American ethnology and</seg><seg type="columnLine">archeology. In a comparatively short space of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had mastered all that could be learned from museums</seg><seg type="columnLine">and books regarding these sciences, and again re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed his long abandoned fieldwork, this time, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, for the sole purpose of studying the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians and the remains of the prehistoric aborigines</seg><seg type="columnLine">in South America. It is needless to even mention hi3</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous discoveries; the monographs and the volumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he wrote, or the rather startling and wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolutionary theories he advanced as a result of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">expeditions and studies. Suffice to say he brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">many new races and cultures to light; founded an</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely new history of Central and South American</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilizations, and solved many ethnological and arche-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ological puzzles which for years had confronted all</seg><seg type="columnLine">other researchers in his chosen fields. All this I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned merely as a preface or explanation to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">why Doctor Henden, who for twenty years had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">known only as an ethnologist and archeologist, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been so well able to record, observe and deduce</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters which bore no relation whatever to either of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those sciences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In 1925 when he set out on his last ill-fated expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition, he stated publicly that he was in hopes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching a hitherto unknown district lying in western</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brazil and eastern Peru, in which, it had been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported, there were mysterious unknown and unexplored</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins. In reality, as was revealed in his notes, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a far more romantic and adventurous object in</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. As all know, he reached Peru in safety, left</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lima several days after his arrival, travelled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Southern Railway to La Paz and thence into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beni River district, and there dropped from sight in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impenetrable and almost limitless forests of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bolivia-Peruvian-Brazilian hinterland. As was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways the case, he went alone, accompanied only by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp-boy and man-of-all-work--a West Indian negro</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been his companion on many expeditions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he secured his porters, boatmen, guides, etc., as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went along. His knowledge of Spanish and Portuguese</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of many Indian dialects made this comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple, and he invariably argued--when the perils of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus penetrating dangerous territory were brought up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could accomplish more in a given time, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel more swiftly and safely, and could be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain of success when alone, than with a party</seg><seg type="columnLine">With every added white man the dangers and responsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilities were greatly increased, he affirmed and, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clincher, he would always point out that no large expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition into the American tropics had ever been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">success, whereas his own and many other "one man"</seg><seg type="columnLine">expeditions had invariably proved successful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■pROM the time he left Santa Cruz on the Beni, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite word was received from Doctor Henden</seg><seg type="columnLine">or his party. That he intended descending the Beni</seg><seg type="columnLine">and exploring the Rio Grande had been well estab-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lished, for he spent some time in La Paz and afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Cochabamba, securing all information possible re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding the tribes on those rivers, and especially re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding the strange bearded Indians known as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirionos of the Rio Grande. Hence, when after two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years nothing had been heard of Doctor Henden, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friends organized a searching party to go after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and selected me as its leader, I followed the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">era! route of these two rivers. Also, I followed Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henden's example and went "light," being accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied only by a camp boy--a half-breed Pano Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and secured my guides and boatmen at San Ramon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last outpost of civilization in Bolivia. I regret</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I am forced to occupy so much space with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly uninteresting details of Doctor Henden's last</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip and with a brief account of my own in search of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him or traces of him, but I fear it is essential if my</seg><seg type="columnLine">readers are to understand the more important matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow and are to accept it as fact rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found no trace of the missing men until I reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country of the Sirionos. These Indians were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves enough to cause anyone to wonder if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dreaming or in his right mind. Entirely nude</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wearing immense bushy beards and heavy mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taches, they resembled Australian Bushmen more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any Indians, while the bows and arrows they used</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed fashioned for a race of giants rather than for</seg><seg type="columnLine">use by rather undersized humans. The bows were</seg><seg type="columnLine">often ten feet in length and five inches across, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrows were an inch or two in diameter, eight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve feet long and with feathers projecting six inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more from the shafts and from two to three feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length. To an ethnologist of Doctor Henden's type</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would have afforded months of study, and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously he had visited and studied them, for, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">amicable relations were established, the Indians told</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the visit of a white man many months previously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That they referred to the missing scientist I felt sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they had been vastly impressed by his black com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion. Moreover, they described the doctor very well</seg><seg type="columnLine">and imitated some of his mannerisms--they are won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful mimics--so accurately that anyone would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized to whom they referred. According to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sirionos, Doctor Henden had remained in the vicinity</seg><seg type="columnLine">for several weeks, during which time he had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">enquiries regarding the tribes and the fabled ruins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were Ins objectives. None of the Sirionos knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything definite regarding either, but while Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henden was there a party of Indians arrived from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Zanteca River and claimed to have accurate knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge. They conversed with the scientist for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. As a result, two of these strangers left with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Doctor when he departed the following day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one of these the Sirionos understood that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">route would be largely through the jungle. But just</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the river was to be left or in what direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were headed, not one of the tribe knew. Hence</seg><seg type="columnLine">my only course was to make my way to the Zanteca</seg><seg type="columnLine">River natives in the hopes of there finding some</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian who knew what route those who accompanied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Henden had followed, for to go blindly into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast wilderness would have been worse than hopeless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortune favored me. At the village on the Zanteca</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found one of the two who had started out with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist. He had not, however, accompanied the Doc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor to the end of his journey, and he knew nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his whereabouts or fate. He and his fellow tribes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had merely guided the Doctor to the first of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luins and had refused to go farther, because, he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">''!e,c°"n,t7 beyond was inhabited by wild hostile tribes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by beings which no man could resist. In fact, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">439</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tales were so bizarre and so utterly preposterous that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I put them down as mere figments of the savage's</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination and superstitious dread of any unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">place or people. He consented, however, to guide me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ruins where he had last seen Doctor Henden</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive. Of that journey it is not necessary to speak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was filled with all the usual hardships of travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the jungle, but eventually we arrived safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the ruined city. I should like to describe the won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders of this lost and forgotten centre of some mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velous prehistoric civilization, but this has its place</seg><seg type="columnLine">elsewhere. Moreover, Doctor Henden describes it fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">and far more lucidly and. accurately in his diary than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was after I had reached these ruins, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great earthquake occurred. Although it ^as only</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly felt in the United States, it was exceedingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">severe throughout South America and particularly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the district within several hundred miles of the Andean</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain. It was coincident with the violent eruption of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mount Misti in Peru, which annihilated Arequipa with</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense loss of life, as all are aware, and utterly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed many towns and villages in Peru, Bolivia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ecuador, Chile, and elsewhere. In the jungle, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been little or no danger to us, but in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient ruined city amid the immense buildings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">monuments, we were in as imminent danger as if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in one of the Andean towns. Moreover, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred in the night and we were awakened by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash and thunder of falling walls and monoliths. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians were panic-stricken, and dashed shrieking from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the courtyard in which we had camped. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatal mistake on their part, for while the patio was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly safe from falling debris, being roofless and</seg><seg type="columnLine">large enough to leave plenty of clear space in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">centre, even if its walls did fall in. Outside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court yard stones were being tossed about and walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were falling on every side. Pedro, my half-breed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pano, remained with me, and throughout that terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">night we cowered in the centre of the court, quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerless to aid the Indians, and sick and nauseated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the heaving, undulating motions of the solid earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath us. When at last the tremors ceased, dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">was breaking and, convinced that there was no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger--for even if the quakes recurred, there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining masonry to fall--we ventured from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge. Outside, the ruins were devastated. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained standing. Debris was piled high everywhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with the faint hopes of finding some of the Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">still alive--perhaps safe in hiding or only wounded--</seg><seg type="columnLine">we moved about shouting and hallooing. For a time'</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the echoes of our voices broke the silence. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a spot where the great central temple had stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">majestically and impressively before the earthquake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we heard a faint sound as of some one striving to reply</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our calls. Climbing with great difficulty over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaped-up masses of broken stone and* fractured idols,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and guided by the human sounds, which, now that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were nearer, were evidently uttered by someone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony, we came at last to the remains of the temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">court. I had expected to find an injured Indian. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead, imagine my utter amazement at finding the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a negro wedged fast beneath an immense fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">column. He was clad in a single garment of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarse silk-like cloth, his body was covered with scars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some recently healed and some showing merely as</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish-white welts against his black skin, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously on the point of death. But he was conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still able to speak. And the first words he uttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">--speaking between agonized gasps, for his chest was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed and his back broken--caused me greater amaze-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ment than finding him there, tor he spoke in English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But even more astounding was what he said. He was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact. Doctor Henden's servant--the Jamaican, Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and I bent low and hung on his words, elated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite my sorrow at Tom's plight, to think I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the scientist or at least was about to learn of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fate. But I was doomed to disappointment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded man's life was ebbing fast, and the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">information he was able to communicate was given</seg><seg type="columnLine">in disconnected sentences or rather words, interrupted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by heart-rending groans and gasps for breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As nearly as I can repeat them they were as fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows: "I Tom--Doctor Henden boy--getting away-</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed--come through tunnel--dead city--earthquake--</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel fall in--I die--better die than slave ant men--</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe all killed--black fellows fight--Doctor Henden</seg><seg type="columnLine">teach them--all in book--in pouch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the last words he choked, a spasm shook him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and death came to relieve his awful sufferings. Much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what he had said was utterly incomprehensible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me at the time--though later, when I had read Doc-*</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor Henden's diary, it all became quite clear. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the scientist was dead; that Tom had escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some tribe whom he called the "ant-people"; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had reached the ruined city by way of a tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been destroyed by the earthquake and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing so had lost his life; those things were quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain. But I was at a loss to understand what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant by the book and pouch. However, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost difficulty, Pedro and I pried the stone from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom's body and dragged him out to give him decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">burial, I discovered that he wore a leather pouch or</seg><seg type="columnLine">wallet strapped to his waist. Opening this, I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few bits of dried fruit, a few grains of some corn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like cereal and a rather bulky package wrapped in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent parchment-like material. Unwrapping this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I disclosed two small books and hastily opening the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stained, worn and rubbed covers, I hastily read in one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Field Notes, 1925-26, B.

But I felt, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I still feel, that at that time the scientist's whereabouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">or fate was of far greater importance than the corpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any man, and that it was my first and most press-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing duty to examine the books which so miraculously</seg><seg type="columnLine">and providentially had come to my hands. My first</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance, however, convinced me that it would take hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">--even days--to read the thousands of closely written</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost microscopic words, covering the hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more pages of the books, and which I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">were written for Doctor Henden's personal use, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">abbreviated, lacking in punctuation, disjointed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">often forming almost a sort of shorthand. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were written precisely as Doctor Henden, myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and innumerable other scientific men jot down notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">when in the field or when making some experiment;</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes intended to refresh the writer's memory in writ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about it later, or merely to be used as references,</seg><seg type="columnLine">generally almost incomprehensible to anyone else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On one point, however, I was satisfied.

I am looking forward to reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing these ruins with a feeling of greater ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement and thrill than I have ever expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rienced on any of my many expeditions. And yet it seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a wholly preposterous wild goose chase that I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">undertaken. At times I feel that I must have absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the superstition and credulity of the aborigines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">among whom I have spent so much time. Certainly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for which I am searching seems beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounds of all probability and scientific reasoning. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no doubt there are unknown ruins ahead, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are countless undiscovered ruins in the country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that there could be any such creatures, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrosities, in existence seems incredible, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">it generally known that I had the faintest belief in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians' tales of such things, my fellow scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">would laugh me to scorn. Hence I have let it be</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that my present expedition is solely for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose of discovering and studying the ruined city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Tupec which, for more than two hundred years</seg><seg type="columnLine">lias been thought to exist somewhere within the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexplored region I am now entering. But I am truly</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced that there must be some basis of fact in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the innumerable tales I have so often heard from so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many and widely separated tribes who could not, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">any circumstances, have heard the story from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another. The aborigines, from my observations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience, do not fabricate tales from whole cloth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we say. They must have a basis or fact of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort to build upon, and while no doubt many of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories are fantastic and highly exaggerated, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where there is some portion of truth in them. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have repeatedly proved and my most noteworthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">discoveries hitherto have been made by following up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indians' myths or legends and tracing them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their foundation. Hence this tale of the bizarre,</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible beings who dwell beyond the ruined city, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nightmarish details of the story, must, I feel, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some basis, and I am determined to find out what that</seg><seg type="columnLine">basis may be. If I succeed and there is even one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousandth part of truth in the stories, then I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made an epochal discovery and will have entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">upset all preconceived ideas of archeology, ethnology</seg><seg type="columnLine">and several other ologies, not only as relating to</seg><seg type="columnLine">South America but to the world in general. But if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">find nothing more than the semi-mythical city of Tupec,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will have accomplished a great deal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  HAVE been sounding the Zantecas regarding the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  tales of weird beings dwelling in the interior be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">yond Tupec. They were loth to speak of it but know</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tale. There is one curious fact in regard to it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however. If no human being can enter the territory</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if no one has ever been there and returned, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">can anyone know anything regarding it? If there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">any truth in it the story must have been handed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from remote times, perhaps from the days when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tupec was inhabited and a civilized race dwelt in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this district. Strange that such a race ever should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have disappeared. What could have destroyed them?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Europeans never entered here and there are no</seg><seg type="columnLine">records to show that the early conquerors had any</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the existence of ruins even. If accounts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Tupec are within a mile of the truth the inhabi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tants must have been a very highly advanced race and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very numerous. One of my greatest efforts will be to</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to ascertain why or how the city was abandoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and why the civilized race vanished. I wonder if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had any connection with the stories of those weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings beyond; if the Tupecans as I might call them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">started that tale. It's all idle speculation and by to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow night I should know whether such a place as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tupec really exists, or whether it is merely some in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">significant ruin or even remains of some forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish fort or outpost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	* *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TUPEC exists. I feel as if I had been dreaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I write this. We reached the ruins day before</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday. All I had heard had not prepared' me for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything so marvelous or of such incalculable arche-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ological value. Nothing in Mayan-Toltec. Aztec, Chib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cha, Incan or pre-Incan remains even approaches these.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is not the remotest similarity between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tupecan architecture, carvings, monoliths and culture</seg><seg type="columnLine">and any of those that I have mentioned, with two</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceptions. In some respects they are striking fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures that are common to these ruins and the ruins</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Tiahuanaco in Bolivia and the Code ruins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panama discovered last year by my friend and confrire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verrill. I am beginning to think that all three civili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zations were merely different stages of the same race's</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancement, Tupec being the last and ultimate stage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also I am already convinced that the people who built"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lived in Tupec were a white race and not in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">digenous to South America. Perhaps--but no, that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">too wild a theory--I was about to say that perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tales so common in tropical America and relating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the existence of a white race, may have had their</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundation in the existence of some remnants of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tupecan people, who still dwell somewhere in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastnesses of the unexplored districts. I shall spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">many days, perhaps months, here.

Their arrangement</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once caused me to suspect they were some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">record, and I am now certain of it. The same figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear in many places and always in orderly arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment exactly as we would use letters in inscriptions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover the discovery of these tablets proves the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth of the theory advanced by Dr. Tello of Lima</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he claimed that the decorative pottery ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sels with human, vegetable and other figures in in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerable slightly varied positions or forms were sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bols employed in recording events and various matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the pre-Incan races of Peru.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have been puzzled by the numerous sculptures and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paintings of strange creatures which are everywhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some are quite easily recognizable as representing</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds, mammals and insects with which I am familiar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but many, although obviously as well and carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn and as accurate reproductions of their subjects</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the others, are- not like anything known to science</seg><seg type="columnLine">today. There are strange creatures that resemble</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragons, or I might rather say pterodactyls; there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant-like creatures with claws and canine teeth;</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings or monkey-like creatures with tails and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaggy hair, and, very commonly, the figures of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect-like thing with enormous jaws, six legs and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. These are usually shown in connection with</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures of semi-human beings with triangular heads,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exaggerated bowed legs, immense outstanding ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">attenuated bodies and bald heads, or with monstrosities</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling overfed hippopotami with innumerable legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and antennae. In several places I have found sculp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of these creatures side by side with those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and of equal size, and on some ceramics, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">also in carvings, these men, attired in truly remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able costumes and armed with strange weapons, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown battling with the beasts. Probably these are</seg><seg type="columnLine">allegorical or symbolic records, possibly showing man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant struggle with the lower animals and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect pests, the latter being exaggerated to indicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">their numbers or dangerous characters. Or again, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be indicative of human enemies, the beast forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">being given as symbolic of contempt or derision. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only decipher the inscriptions I might discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key to these matters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">* *Jf -&gt;r</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I HAVE made a most astounding discovery, a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery which has completely upset all my former</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas and conjectures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The weird figures I mentioned are representations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those beings so vividly described in the Indians'</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories.

I could then have wedged the door so</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could not close behind us. I could have made a closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">study of the mechanism. I could have somehow ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged it so that we could retreat within the passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and close the portal in our rear. But I did none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things. When the door at last swung open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed a vast strange country beyond, we--or rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, for I assume all responsibility as leader of the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">--carelessly allowed the door to swing to, and we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">it irrevocably locked when, terrified beyond our senses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we again attempted to reenter the tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before us, as we emerged from the passageway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched a strange country, as I have said. On every</seg><seg type="columnLine">side it was surrounded by immense, snow-capped</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridges. As nearly as I can judge from my knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of geology, the entire place is the stupendous crater</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an extinct volcano. In fact, the land appears to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very bottom of a long-dead crater, for the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding mountains must be fully twenty-five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in height. And as there are no such mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising above the country of the outer world, I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that the immense territory here must be at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten thousand feet below the level of the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the continent. It is like the bottom of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge well or giant mine-shaft. Everything points to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. It is hot. damp, humid. The sky is overcast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the mountains veiled in vapor. The vegetation is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of prehistoric days and is rank, primitive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">viscous. Fungi are everywhere and of preposterous</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportions. There are mushrooms higher than my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, rv.ssolas towerlike trees among clusters af agari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cus that would serve as shelters for a mounted horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Lichens and liverworts form deep carpets; club-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosses and hepaticac here reach the dimensions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cedar trees and cabbages; parasitic vines and plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">are of gigantic size and incredibly rapid growth; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees are fleshy-leaved and pithy, and the air is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy, so laden with moisture and so reeking with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the odors of decaying vegetation and the overpowering</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent of the inhabitants, that it is oppressive and diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult to breathe. No doubt these conditions have brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the unique, the terrifying and incredible condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of animal life which exist here, just as the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vironment of the giant dinosaurs resulted in the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopment of reptilian life to the nth degree. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am wandering, theorizing, and cannot waste my all too</seg><seg type="columnLine">little space by recording such thoughts. I must set</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the facts; my observations. Just why I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">do this is rather a puzzle. I feel sure we shall never</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape from this place. It is equally certain that my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">notes will never reach the outside world. And yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such is man's psychology, that even when all hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">is abandoned, he still goes on, following his accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed habits, planning his future; and I am writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">this exactly as if I expected to return to civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any time and planned to elaborate my notes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">form a report on this impossible place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first, when we emerged from the passage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed upon the bizarre country, we saw no signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants. There was no town, no village in sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But presently one of the Indians--whose eyes are al; .</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways keener than those of civilized man--saw some</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature moving about in the dense jungle upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain below us. We were woefully in need of food,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as there appeared to be no danger from hostile</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages, we descended the hillside--which I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">even then appeared to be an artificial mound rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a natural formation, in the hopes of securing</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. It was when we reached the first vegetation</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I became aware of its remarkable character. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">warily we approached the spot where the Pano had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the creature, for we did not know what sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast it might be--whether carnivorous or a ruminant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether it might prove ferocious or timid--and we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no mind to be either unexpectedly attacked or to lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">our dinner. Presently we heard the sounds of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature ahead, the rustling of foliage, and a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">crunching, creaking noise which I may best compare</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sound of a heavy cart passing over corn stalks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With my revolver drawn and with the Indians holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bows in readiness for instant use, we pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. The next second I staggered back, unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to believe my eyes, while the Panos screamed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror, and turning, dashed madly from the spot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stretched along the limb of a low tree was what at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first sight appeared to be a gigantic serpent, its huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of mottled green and brown undulating slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moving slowly forward. But the next instant I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized it was no snake, for through an opening among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaves I caught sight of legs; stout fleshy legs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with coarse hair and terminating in disk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like horny feet that clasped the bark of the limb.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, as I gazed, fascinated and . incredulous, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing reared its head. A huge, rough, dull-red head</seg><seg type="columnLine">with immense expressionless staring eyes and vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw-toothed horny jaws. Seizing a-thick fleshy leaf between</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, the mandibles ripped through the leaf with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crunching noise I have mentioned. It was absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbelievable, positively impossible, but true. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was a caterpillar, a monstrous gigantic larva</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully ten feet in length! A scream from the Panos</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the spell in which I stood transfixed, gazing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing. With Tom at my side, shaking and actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale, we turned and hurried towards the cries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What we saw seemed to freeze the blood in my veins</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caused Tom to drop to his knees, chattering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthing in abject terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Side by side, the two Indians were battling furiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a most terrifying, fearsome creature. That he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">human or semi-human no one could doubt. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a monster, a being fit only for a nightmare, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shock I recognized him as the original of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the weird figures I had found at Tupec. His head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hairless, misshapen and almost triangular in form,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with immense outstanding ears. His body, thin almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to emaciation, was black as night and covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">close-growing wooly hair, and his short legs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormously bowed. His back was towards me, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was leaping about, with his immensely long arms aim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sharp, terrific blows at the Indians, who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">already torn, and bleeding from dozens of deep wounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broken arrow shafts protruded from one shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">443</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a thigh of the creature. Evidently the Panos had</seg><seg type="columnLine">used their weapons effectively, yet the missiles im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedded in his body did not appear to affect the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture's vitality in the least. And he was at too close</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters for the Panos to use their bows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS ferocity was terrible, and the worst of it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fought silently, not uttering a sound, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">at every blow of his hands--and with horror I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these were armed with sharp, long claws--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians screamed and groaned in agony and deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear.. All this I took in at a first glance. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitation I raised my pistol and fired point-blank at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing's back. I knew I had not missed, but in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of falling dead or wounded as I had expected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature wheeled, and at sight of its fac#, a cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">of horror escaped me and I fell back, trembling, shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Never has living man seen such a face. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, staring, expressionless, lustreless, lidless eyes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black triangular-shaped head; the huge, drewling</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth with flappy lips revealing toothless gums, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the utter absence of a nose, but with two yawning</seg><seg type="columnLine">black holes for nostrils, were those of a fiend of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eternal pit, rather than of anything of flesh and blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the space of a second the thing stared at me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, without a sound, it turned and recommenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">its attack upon the Panos. As rapidly as I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull trigger I emptied my revolver into the bestial</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster until, fairly riddled with bullets, it slumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth. But it was too late. The Panos had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly ripped to pieces. One was already dead and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other was breathing his last. And I had no time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid him even had his condition warranted it. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dense growth of vegetation sounds were issuing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds of approaching things, being attracted per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps by the shouts of the Panos, perhaps by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds of my revolver shots. Who or what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might prove I did not know and I had no wish to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main to see. Already, within the space of a few short</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, I had seen more than enough. The place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too terrible, too monstrous. Thinking only of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape, only of putting as much distance as possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">between us and more of those fearful black things in</seg><seg type="columnLine">human form, I shook and cursed Tom into action and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced madly towards the mound-like hill whence we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued from the tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once I glanced back and the blood seemed to freeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my veins as I saw a crowd, a horde, of the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible beings in pursuit. But they were not fleet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot, we were gaining on them, and felt that if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reach the hill and the tunnel, we might yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape. Imagine my horror, my frenzy, as we gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hill and found the gate to the passage irretrievably</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed against us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madly we tore and beat at the massive stone portal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled ourselves against it, wasted our puny strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">in vain efforts to swing that ton or more of rock. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">each moment, as we struggled, and as sweat poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our skins and cold dread chilled our hearts, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearsome beings were approaching us. Presently they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were close at hand, silent, ominous, and so sure was</seg><seg type="columnLine">I that we were about to die an awful death, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed my pistol to my temple and pulled the trigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I remembered that in my blind terror I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten to reload the weapon. Before I could slip a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridge into the cylinder, the things were upon us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I drew back, cowering, trembling, while Tom, paralyzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fear, was a pitiable sight. I expected the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures--I cannot even now call them men--to fall upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and rend us as they had the Panos. But for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexplicable reason, they did not. Though they made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sounds, yet they seemed to be conversing, carrying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on some sort of argument among themselves, debating</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps what end to make of us. Realizing we were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be summarily destroyed, I regained some measure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of courage and hope. I peered intently at them, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fathom their thoughts, their intentions, by watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their gestures and expressions. But their flat, nose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, triangular faces were expressionless, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge, dull eyes gave no hint of the reactions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds behind them. But from their actions and atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudes I judged that we were as strange to them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were to us. And being rather familiar with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychology of savages, I took heart, knowing that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage in his calmer moments seldom destroys that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which excites his wonder or curiosity. Nevertheless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the things had killed the Indians, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians must have been as strange to the thing's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as were ourselves. But very possibly, I thought, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panos had been the aggressors. Seing the black being,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had very probably taken no chances, but had shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it, and the pain of the arrow wounds had enraged</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and it had flown at them in a frenzy. All the time -</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these thoughts were racing through my brain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black beings were standing around us, gazing un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">winkingly at us, staring fixedly; their loose lips slob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bering over their toothless gums in a most horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. Then two stepped forward and stretched out</seg><seg type="columnLine">claw-fingered hands towards Tom. He shrieked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror and drew back, but the beings did not even in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicate that his agonized screams had been heard. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily as though he had been a mere child, they lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, stood him on his feet, and with- their faces close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, sniffed at him, passed their hands over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin and his garments, and having apparently satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves on' some score, they passed him to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows and turned to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a terrifying, an indescribably awful ordeal I</seg><seg type="columnLine">underwent. The reek of the things was nauseating, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange pungent odor that reminded me of something</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had smelled before but overpowering in its acrid</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, while the hideous faces of the brutes as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffed at me and the feel of the rough hairy skin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal-like claws as they touched me, caused me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiver and shrink from them. But they showed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to injure us, although I well knew that a single'</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke of those talon-like fingers could rend me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the terrible examination was at an end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again the things seemed earnestly though inaudibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussing us, and once more I felt sick with fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">at what fate they might decide should be ours. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seizing poor Tom roughly by the scruff of the neck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and urging me more gently but no less insistently, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things turned from the hillside, and with us, captives</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their midst, hurried towards the jungle whence they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning to one side before we reached the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the Panos had met their end, the beings con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducted us along a sort of roughly worn trail. Even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my extremity and my fear I could not avoid noticing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weird character of our surroundings; the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">fungi, and the preponderance of parasitic plants. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what animal life I saw amazed me even more. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dark shadow fell across our path, and there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustle as of huge wings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Startled, I glanced up. My eyes stared incredulously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for above us a butterfly flew slowly. But such a but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terfly no other mortal had ever gazed upon; a scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and orange thing of indescribable beauty fully a yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">in length and six feet across the velvety wings. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flash my mind reverted to that first astounding dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery we had made, to that huge larva browsing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaves and in my suddenly awakened interest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">444</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">entomology and my speculations as to whether this</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious insect were the image of that larva, all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">worries and fears were momentarily forgotten. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next second our captors appeared to be seized with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden panic. They released their grasps on us, darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in to the shelter of nearby plants and giant toadstools,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crouched, trembling, in the shadows. Wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had frightened them, but realizing that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread danger must threaten, I followed their example</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dragged Tom, dazed and incapable of thought or</seg><seg type="columnLine">action, into the shelter of a broad-leaved vine. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my wondering, incredulous ears came a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound, the vibrant humming of a distant airplane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Human beings, civilized men must be near. For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting all else, I sprang into the open, gazing expec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tantly at the vapor shrouded sky, ready to shout, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave my hands, to use every effort to attract the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention of the airship's occupant the instant it appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With astonishing rapidity the humming increased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It became a roar. At any instant I expected to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine flash into sight above the tree tops. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly it burst into view, and as my straining eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested upon it my face blanched, and with a cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror I flung myself headlong into the undergrowth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I HAD expected to see an airplane, a fabric of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and machinery made by the hand of man, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fellow being, a civilized man or men, within it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead, the apparition that roared into the range</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my astounded vision was a living thing, a huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged creature flying low above the trees; a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fill the stoutest heart with mad terror; a creature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful, menacing aspect. Brief as had been my glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thing before I sought safety in hiding. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized it as the original of those figures in Tupec,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had mistaken for pterodactyls. And instantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, I had recognized it for what it was. Its great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring, many-facetted eyes, its immense multiple jaws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the outer serrated mandibles, the short vibrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">antennae, the gleaming black and golden thorax and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream-line abdomen terminating in a needle-like point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unmistakable. It was a hornet! a gigantic, pred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atory insect belonging to the group of solitary hymen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">optera. No doubt it was searching for some victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, having been stung into a state of helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralysis, would be buried alive, inert but conscious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the hornet's grubs emerged from their eggs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoured the living flesh, so thoughtfully provided by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their savage parent. Scores, hundreds, thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">times I had watched solitary wasps and hornets as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they seized spiders, larva; and even locusts, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzing them carried them to their nests to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stored away as a live food supply for their young. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, now I was shaking, shivering with abject terror,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as overhead circled a hornet as large as an eagle, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapacious terrible insect large and powerful enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swoop upon me and plunge its numbing, paralyzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sting into my own body. Cold sweat broke out upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my temples at thought of such a fate, at thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being buried alive but incapable of movement in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground chamber, until hungry, loathsome, wrig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling maggots threw themselves blindly upon me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnawed at my palpitating living flesh. From the actions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the savages near me, I knew my fears were well</seg><seg type="columnLine">justified. They were even more terrified than I, if such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing were possible, for no doubt they knew from dire</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience the extent of the danger that hovered over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Only Tom appeared oblivious to this newest</seg><seg type="columnLine">peril. But he had no knowledge of the habits of hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nets, and, moreover, his brain had been so surcharged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fright that it held no space for further fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long that fearsome giant insect hung on hum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming wings in the air above us I shall never know. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed like hours, and each moment I expected it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">descend and seize a victim from among us. Again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again I felt that its great eyes or its delicate waving</seg><seg type="columnLine">antennae had located us as it swooped downward, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, horny, clawed legs outstretched, its ravening</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws open, its abdomen thrust forward with shining,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dagger-like sting unsheathed. But either it was not cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of our character or our location or else it hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated to risk its membraneous wings among the foliage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and branches, for each time, with an angry buzz, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew off, until at last it dashed with terrific speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the spot and the humming of its vibrating wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew faint in the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not until then did our captors rise, and again, seiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing us, proceed on their interrupted journey. By now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, much of my first terrible fears of the beings had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn off. Possibly familiarity was beginning to breed</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt or again it may have been a subconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that as we had not hitherto been harmed we '</seg><seg type="columnLine">would remain alive and whole. But largely I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was due to the tremendous scientific interest my</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange surroundings had aroused and to my realiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that we faced far greater dangers from the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">denizens of this world than from our captors. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct emotions cannot exist coincidently ir. the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human brain, and my interest in the overdeveloped in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects, the strange vegetal growths and the innumer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able abnormalities on every side overrode my fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drove terror from my mind. Moreover, I had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">an astonishing discovery, or rather, I might say, reali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zation had come to me once fear had fled and my brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cleared sufficiently to co-ordinate and function in</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less normal fashion. I was in an insect world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a land where, for some inexplicable reason, evolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">had proceeded along insect lines; where vertebrates</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken second place, and where the conditions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the world had been reversed and super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects dwarfed and dominated man. Thinking thus,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I studied the savages more closely. And as I did so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my senses fairly reeled as I made a second and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more astounding discovery. The creatures were almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much insects as men! To be sure they walked up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and possessed but four limbs and they had more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less human-like forms, but their heads and faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">were totally unlike those of men; their eyes were dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly insect-like; their digits were more claws than</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers; their immense ears savored of short, heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">antennae, and the manner in which the first one I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen had continued fighting while apparently ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livious of his wounds, was astonishingly like the actions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a wounded insect. It was unthinkable, preposterous</seg><seg type="columnLine">to even dream that they were insects; that any insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have evolved or developed such humanlike char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acteristics. But was it not possible that in this land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I had abundant proof of conditions which favored</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dominance of insects, such vertebrates as there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have assumed insect-like characters?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scientifically I could see no reason for assuming</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this were not only possible but highly probable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Environment has an even greater influence upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">development of living organism than heredity. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">land where all the environment was adapted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">survival and the development of insects there would</seg><seg type="columnLine">most assuredly be a tendency for vertebrates--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--to evolve certain characteristics which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">enable him to exist, and which, therefore, would in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitably be insect-like. It was an amazing idea wjth</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding possibilities and, incredible as it may seem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was actually beginning to rejoice that fate had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creed that it was to be my privilege to study such</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently the Panos had used their weapons effectively; yet the missiles imbedded in his body did not appear to affect tho creature's vitality in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tho least . . . Without hesitation, I raised my pistol and fired point-blank at the thing's back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">445</seg><seg type="columnLine">446</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">abnormal and undreamed of conditions of life. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet I had seen only the fringe of the land, had observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a few, an infinitesimal portion of its marvels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What wonders might yet remain, what incredibly as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonishing objects and events might be in store, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding discoveries might be made--provided I lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make them--were impossible even to guess. In such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a land, amid such surroundings, almost anything might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be possible, but my wildest dreams, my most fantastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">conjectures, were far short of the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH my mind busy with such thoughts, with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fears of our captors dissipated, I gave even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful attention to our surroundings. Repeatedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormously overgrown insects were seen. Mostly they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were inoffensive, harmless things even in their enorm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous size. Somehow, too, a remarkable sensation of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion possessed me. Instead of the insects and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants appearing of gigantic size I had the feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being dwarfed, of being a Liliputian accompanied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally Liliputian beings moving through a normal land</seg><seg type="columnLine">among normal creatures. In fact, the exact sensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">one might have were one suddenly reduced to the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a midget, perhaps six inches in height, and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">oneself in a brushy, weed-filled pasture. Once this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation of inverted proportions had entered my brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not rid myself of it, try as I might. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly the same as the effect of an optical delusion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like looking at the well known representation of shaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">cubes which, when gazed at fixedly for a space, sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly turn upside down, after which it is next to im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to force one's optic nerves to see them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their original position. And, up to the present moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I still feel as though it were Tom and myself who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">abnormal--insignificant beings the size of cucumbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid ordinary sized surroundings. Thus the immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">bamboo-like growths assumed the character of ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasses as they would appear to a toad or to the white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">footed little deer-mouse; to a sparrow's eyes the slug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gish caterpillars for which he sought would appear no</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger than the giant, bristle-clad larvae, I saw; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mole, or meadow mouse, following his well-worn path-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways across a meadow, might well have gazed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">much the same surroundings as those through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we passed as our captors led us along their trail. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed with this strange hallucination did I become</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I began to wonder whether the insect life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetable growths about me were actually of gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">size or whether in some inexplicable manner my brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been affected in such a way that I was seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">things with distorted vision. So insufferable did this</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt in my mind become that, in order to test my</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses, I grasped the edge of a russet-hued toadstool</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reached to my shoulder and wenched off a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of the fungi. As the thing broke, a nauseating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">overpowering odor almost choked me, and from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickly-gray decomposing mass three horrible, corpse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, wriggling maggots dropped. One struck my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder with a thud, and a feeling of sickening re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsion ran through me at its touch. Another fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth in front of me, and before I could avoid it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stepped squarely upon the thing and my foot was</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried to my ankle in the horrid pulpy body. If my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and brain were deceiving me, so were my hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my nerves, my feet, and I was convinced that what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever my sensations of proportion might be, I was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a land where normal men were puny as compared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insect and plant life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, I found myself wondering what the beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had captured us ate; where and how they lived;</seg><seg type="columnLine">how they communicated with one another, and whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were the only vertebrate denizens of the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">So far we had seen no other vertebrates; no birds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mammals or even reptiles or datrachians, but that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, did not prove their non-existence. And if</seg><seg type="columnLine">such higher forms of animal life existed what, I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered, would they be like?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Would they, too, be gigantic? Would they also have</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquired more or less of the insect characters? Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">would they have remained normal in size and character?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was fascinating to speculate on such .matters, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to be able to communicate with the black beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to learn something of themselves and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. But every effort to do this failed. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were apparently dumb, my words meant nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and sign3 were obviously incomprehensible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now, Tom also had recovered from his first over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelming terror, and although still shaking with fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain was beginning to function and he was taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">note of his bizarre surroundings. Once or twice he</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered exclamations of surprise, and once, when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant cricket nearly two feet in length leaped unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectedly across the pathway, he gave vent to a startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry and sprang back. And gradually, as I managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get him to converse, I found that he had none of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensations of being dwarfed, which was a vast relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, for it was convincing proof that everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of gigantic size except the savages who had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had now passed through the densest part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle and had entered an area of immense grasses</seg><seg type="columnLine">or bamboos. Suddenly these ended, and before us was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cleared open stretch, in the centre of which was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular ring or mound of stones. As we came within</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of this, scores of the black creatures swarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the edge and came hurrying towards us. As they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came forward in a close-packed mass, their triangular</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces and great staring eyes were so strikingly insect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that they appeared more like a swarm of ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">than like a crowd of human beings. In a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">more we were surrounded. The creatures were evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently tremendously excited. Their heads swung from</seg><seg type="columnLine">side to side on their long, thin necks; they moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">about with nervous quick motions; their antennae-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears seemed actually to vibrate, and their saliva-drib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling lips twisted and grimaced, while from them</seg><seg type="columnLine">there issued an almost inaudible indescribable droning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though their vocal cords were vibrating without pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing articulate sounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the midst of the horde as we were, the odor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies was almost more than I could bear, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes smarted and ran and I coughed and sneezed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though afflicted with hay fever. All the time we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being urged onward towards the stone mound</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, between stumbling, walking and clamboring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and being pushed and shoved, we at last found our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves on the summit. It was a broad wall or barrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stone surrounding a circular sandy area or hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the centre of which was a roughly built stone pile---</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can scarcely dignify it with the name of building--</seg><seg type="columnLine">perforated by innumerable apertures or openings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Straight towards this we were hurried, and still sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by a crowd of the creatures although the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great majority remained outside, we were led through</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the openings and along a downward-sloping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding and inky-black passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH endless tunnels and galleries we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">led, and gradually our eyes became somewhat ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed to the darkness and I could distinguish the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy walls and at times more or less of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teriors of the chambers we passed or entered. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the walls of the tunnels were plastered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dried mud or were built up with stones, and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">447</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where the place reeked with the smell of the beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a different, sickishly-sweet odor that issued</seg><seg type="columnLine">from certain galleries or rooms. In some places I</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught glimpses of figures moving about, but whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were males or females was impossible to say. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">last we were conducted into a fairly large chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a very dim light entered through a crack or</seg><seg type="columnLine">crevice in the ceiling. And as I glanced about, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting to find some sort of ruler or chief presiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the place, I rubbed my eyes and could scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit my senses. Instead of a king or ruler or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a council of the beings who had captured us, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most astonishing sight I had yet beheld. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there about the chamber were insects of huge size.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Partly reared on his stout legs was a long-bodied, rudi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary-winged rover-beetle nearly a yard length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his big eyes staring at us with an oddly vapid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceful expression that was almost ludicrous. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having apparently lost interest in the newcomers, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled back lazily upon the floor. Near him was an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense, hairy-bodied, bee-like fly with a fat overfed body</seg><seg type="columnLine">as large as a pumpkin, and preening its antennae with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one foot, so strikingly like a paunchy man stroking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mustache after a full meal, that even Tom chuckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sight. In another spot a drowsy-looking, wing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less nymph reposed upon its belly; a soft-bodied, imma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture thing with glassy, sightless eyes and undeveloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulpy legs; the yard-long young of some species of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hymenopterous insect, helpless as a human baby.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond this were several smaller insects I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not identify, while curled up like a sleeping puppy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so obviously slumbering that I could almost fancy it</seg><seg type="columnLine">snored, was a great, wooly-coated caterpillar. What did</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mean? Were these things prisoners like ourselves?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Were they destined to be killed and eaten by the sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages, and were we destined for the same fate? There</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed no other explanation of this aggregation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange creatures to which we had been added, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages were acquiring a menagerie and regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom and myself as exhibits. Then, for the first time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I noticed that the creatures I have mentioned were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being tended by members of the tribe who had cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured us. Several of the beings were offering the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects food, waiting upon them, caring for them. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I watched in surprise, two of the things approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom and myself, bearing bunches of tender leaves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They offered them to us as if expecting us to devour</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as eagerly as the caterpillar, which had uncoiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself and was crunching avidly at the leaves given to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. They seemed greatly disturbed when we refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dine on the leaves, and scurried about excitedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently one returned with a fragment of a mushroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">--evidently they had misinterpreted my act in break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the fungus as I had walked along--while a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought a piece of stinking meat. The meat almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned my stomach, although the giant fly had ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroking its antennae to dine on the same flesh. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravenously hungry and, having tasted the fungus, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to swallow some of it. Tom, however, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stomach it, and again the beings, who seemed so</seg><seg type="columnLine">solicitous of our welfare, scurried off to return with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sweet, sugary, pasty material which Tom found</seg><seg type="columnLine">palatable, declaring that it tasted like condensed milk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This I noticed was also eaten by the mild-eyed rover</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle, as well as by the nymph. With something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread that we would be forced to subsist upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same fare as that provided for the insect occupants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chamber, I squatted down, leaned against the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wondered what would be the ultimate end of it all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our captors apparently paid little heed to us, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing us unwatched and unguarded when they frequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the room to return with more food. And, strangely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, now that they had us here and had fed us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they appeared to take little interest in us. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexplicable behavior, and I could only surmise that</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually we would be taken before the ruler of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings and that our fate would then be decided. Still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something in the attitude of our captors</seg><seg type="columnLine">which puzzled me greatly. They somehow acted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though we were guests rather than prisoners, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally, in order to test the matter, I rose to my feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked boldly towards the entrance to the chamber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom, worn out with his fear and the strain he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been under, was fast asleep, and I did not disturb him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two beings still in the room glanced up as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned towards the doorway, but they showed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of interfering with my actions. Stooping low to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass through the portal, I stepped into the passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sauntered onward. Several of the beings met me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">several overtook me, but not one showed the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in my movements or offered to molest me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any way. I was fairly astounded. For all I could see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was at liberty to go anywhere I pleased, and I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if I would be permitted to reach the open air and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to leave the home of the beings. I was strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to test it, but I feared I would lose my way</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the multiplicity of galleries and passages and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be unable to return to Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There would be plenty of time to discover how free</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were later, and turning, I walked back and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the chamber where the strange insects and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom appeared to be all wrapped in sleep. Feeling tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drowsy myself, I decided there was nothing better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to follow their example, and stretching myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside Tom, I closed my eyes. Then, as I dozed off</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my half-conscious brain reverted dreamily to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">events of the day, I suddenly burst out laughing as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastical idea entered my mind. Why hadn't I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it before? Why hadn't this solution of the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to me? Now I understood why Tom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself were there, why those giant insects were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber, why they and ourselves were being fed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended by the strange beings. Yes, my knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">entomology, of the life histories and habits of insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have made it all clear to me at first sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that great rover-beetle, the paunchy fly, the helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">nymph, the drowsy caterpillar. Like their prototypes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the outside world, that dwell within the nests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants and bees and are not only suffered to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">but are actually fed and tended by their hosts, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects about me were inquilines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were lazy, improvident guests of these beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">who despite their human forms, were themselves so</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant-like. Inquilines that perhaps had come uninvited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or that, perhaps, had been brought here as Tom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself had been. And it was this thought that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought a chuckle of laughter to my lips. The thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conviction, that ive two were nothing more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquilines; creatures to be regarded with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">tolerance and as on the same plane as the insects that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shared the underground chamber with us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I AWOKE greatly refreshed and much easier in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. Tom was already awake, but our insect com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions appeared to be still slumbering. I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea how long I had slept, and the chamber was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark to permit me to see my watch. I was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of striking a match in order to learn the hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but realizing how scanty was my supply of matches, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought better of thus wasting one of the precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. But I was longing to smoke, and at last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to resist longer--for I had not had a whiff of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacco since entering the country--I decided that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">448</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could afford one match for lighting my pipe and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">determine the time with the same light. The effect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lighting of the match was astounding. As the flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared up, momentarily lighting the room, every occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pant came to life instantly. There was a rustling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings, the scratching of chitonous feet, the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurrying bodies, and strange clicking noises. Instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything was in confusion. The rover-beetle rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurrying into a dark passage; the aldermanic fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread its wings and flew blindly about, bumping into</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls and against the ceiling; the wooly caterpillar un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiled and hurried out of sight as if it had a pressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">engagement elsewhere, and the savages who were within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chamber threw themselves on the floor in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">paroxysm of terror. Only the pulpy, helpless nymph</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained placid, utterly unmoved, utterly oblivious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything, just as any normal nymph should be. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so surprised at the effect of the sudden light upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creatures, that I held the match until it scorched</seg><seg type="columnLine">my fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But after all, I thought, it was not really sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prising in the least. Insects invariably react to a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">in darkness. They may be attracted by it and blunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it--the proverbial moths and the flame--or, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of many beetles and other insects, they exhibit</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear and seek safety by hiding themselves in the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est crevices they can find. And the insect denizens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chamber were all inquilines, creatures whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives are spent in darkness. Merely because they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gigantic proportions was no reason why they should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be any more intelligent than ordinary insects or should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not possess precisely the same habits, characteristics</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reactions as the normal sized insects of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">genera. Somehow, quite unconsciously, probably be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause Tom and I had been treated like the other in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quilines, and perhaps partly on account of their size</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had begun to regard the huge insect inhabitants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land as sentient, intelligent beings, more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">like higher forms of life or even like primitive humans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, the effect of my match upon the creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me suddenly to the realization that, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing it, I had been brought into a curious psycho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical state, wherein I had been regarding the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown insects like fellow men or, to put it another</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, I had unwittingly placed myself, mentally, on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane with the insects. And this knowledge explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a measure the ant-like characteristics of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages. Through countless generations they had lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">among insects, had inhabited a land where insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominated. If I, a civilized, and I flatter myself an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusually intelligent man, so quickly and unconsciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquired this amazing psychological state, the wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that the poor, ignorant, semi-human savages had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not ages ago lost what little intelligence and human</seg><seg type="columnLine">characteristics they had possessed. And it was not sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prising that they, too, had been terror-stricken at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flare of a match. When I came to think of it, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen no signs of fires anywhere, and the chance3 were</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they did not even know how to make a fire. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">my discovery of their fear of flame was most oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune and did much to encourage me. Fire would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon with which I could rule the beings, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted if even the most courageous of them would</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to interfere with us, once they had seen me</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce the phenomenon. But I soon found that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed an even more potent and terrible power than</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. Telling Tom of my plans and explaining as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I might what I believed our position to be, we rose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leading the way, I started down the passage. AS</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the previous day, no one attempted to interfere</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us. And presently I noticed that, as we ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached them, all the savages within sight raced off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as though the devil were at their heels. Moreover, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came pouring from chambers and galleries and filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passage to overflowing as they crowded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled to get out of our way, until the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us was packed with a milling, excited throng.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first I thought that word of my match had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread and that the savages were terrified for fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would again strike a light. Then, suddenly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth burst upon me; it was the smoke from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe. Perhaps the sight of the smoke was enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike terror to their hearts or, more probably, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor of the tobacco was the cause of their fright.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But whatever the basic cause, the result was in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor, for not only was it obvious that we had noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to fear from that time on, but in addition, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had merely to follow the retreating mob in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the open air. The instant they reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exits to the tunnels, the creatures scattered and ran,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we found ourselves quite alone, with the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of dawn just breaking through the heavy veil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mists that shrouded the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE smell of the fresh air and of vegetation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">most welcome after the musty, malodorous at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere of the subterranean chambers, and we sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">there taking deep breaths and waiting for the sun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise. I had determined that as soon as it was light</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to see, I would go in search of food. The bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of musty fungus I had eaten had merely taken the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge off my ravenous hunger, and Tom confessed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt famished. Somewhere in the land there must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be edible fruit, vegetables or game, and I was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to find out what alimentary resources the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country possessed. I still had my revolver and a belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of cartridges, and though I am no expert marks-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, I felt confident that I could manage to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">down any ordinary sized animal or bird we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">find. Also, there was a chance that there might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish in the streams or pools I had seen, and, all else</seg><seg type="columnLine">failing, we might be able to fall back upon some form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of insect. More than once, when among Indians, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had eaten dried grasshopper meal, fried caterpillars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roasted palm grubs, and from personal experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew that, when one's natural repugnance to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things was overcome, that food was nutritious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">palatable. And I could see no reason why a grub, larva</seg><seg type="columnLine">or grasshopper should not be equally edible, if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to be several feet long, instead of an inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two. In fact, at that moment, I could picture din-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off a grasshopper's drumstick or a beetle-grub</seg><seg type="columnLine">steak with intense satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile I loaded my pistol and chatted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom, while in the distance, the shadowy forms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages lurked about, watching us fearfully and ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take flight at the first movement on our part.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were, after all, a most timid and harmless lot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I wondered that I had been so terrified by them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the first place. But then again, I had seen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstration of their fighting ability and I thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciated the fact that, should they screw up their</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage to the proper pitch, they could make short</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of us without much danger to themselves. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it requires the highest degree of both mental and</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical courage to attack an unknown being, and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially a being who is regarded with superstition</seg><seg type="columnLine">or, who is regarded as a superior being. And I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not imagine those triangular headed degenerate sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages possessing any mental courage no matter how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much physical valor they might have. Now I felt per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly secure as far as any danger from our recent</seg><seg type="columnLine">hosts was concerned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, too, the light had increased sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">449</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for us to start on our hunt. Leaving the savages to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own devices and to their underground retreats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we clambered over the stone wall, walked across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open space and found ourselves in the jungle. On every</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand strange noises and rather terrifying sounds is-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued from the shadows and thickets. Some of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">I recognized. The siren-like, deafening screech from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clump of bamboos was unquestionably that of a giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">cricket. The piercing, ear-splitting note was probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some awakening grasshopper. The crunching</seg><seg type="columnLine">rending noises were caused by hungry larvse devouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moisture-laden leaves, and the loud, clicking noises,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a hammer striking metal, were, I decided, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced by beetles. The whole place appeared to teem</seg><seg type="columnLine">with life, and at every turn we caught glimpses of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy insects. Probably the number of insects in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place is not any greater in proportion to the &amp;ea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vegetation than elsewhere, but owing to the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they are all, or nearly all, of exaggerated size,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they appeared far more numerous. Also, as we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">relatively small, we were better able to discover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects. Had we, too, been built on the same propor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionate scale as human beings in an ordinary land, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt if we would have noticed any greater abundance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of insect life than in an ordinary meadow or forest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as it was, we were not only enabled to see prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically every insect within reach of our vision, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afforded a most marvelous opportunity of studying</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lives and habits. It was, in fact, like looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at everything through a powerful microscope, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger was forgotten in my interest in watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange life about me. Even Tom, who was not in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least given to an interest in natural history, and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways considered all forms of insect life as "bugs" to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be destroyed, became quite excited and fascinated as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out the habits of the creatures about us. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limb of a spreading tree a fat-bodied spider the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of a tea-tray, and with hairy legs as thick as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling-pin, was industriously spinning a web of gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing silken strands, each strand the size of stout cord.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when a blundering gnat as large as a sparrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew blindly into the half-completed web, and the fero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious owner dashed at it, enveloped it in coils of silk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gloatingly proceeded to devour the captive, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the tragedy with almost hypnotic fascination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom glanced nervously about. "Wa-laa" he ejacu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated, "Ah don't wantin' for to meet sco'pions an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarant'las here 'bout, Chief. Nor cent'pedes neither. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent'pede mos' surely be as big as derr. bo'on'strictors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' a sco'pion de bigness of a cow. No, Chief, Ah</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't longin' fo' meet none of dem folk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But fortunately we met neither centipedes, scor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pions nor predatory arachnids, though I could fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciate Tom's fears of such an encounter, and fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized the dangerous character of such creatures, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the same proportions as the other insects. A scor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pion six feet in length, a mygale or tarantula weigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a score of pounds or a centipede twice as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man would indeed be a formidable enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT even without these to reckon with, there was, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt, no little peril in wandering through this</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle of strange forms of plant life. Many of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">commonest insects are predatory, still more are car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nivorous, and, for their size, insects are the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage, ferocious and utterly fearless of all creatures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To be sure, as a rule insects are very particular as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their food, and a species which devours caterpillars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for example, will attack and eat nothing else. Hence, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoned, that if human beings were not included in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the menu of any of the insects in this land, we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively little to fear, for it is rarely that any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">insect attacks another creature except for the purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">of eating it. But, on the other hand, I had witnessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terror of the black savages when the solitary</seg><seg type="columnLine">hornet had approached, and, for all I knew, the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects of this country might have acquired a liking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for human flesh and blood. A tiger-beetle a yard in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length would be a bad customer and would be far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more dangerous than a tiger. An aphislion with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous scissors-like jaws a foot in length would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to shear a man's head from his shoulders. And if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were ants, as I felt there must be, they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">and probably would prove the most dangerous of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preposterously overdeveloped fauna of this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. In addition to all these unknown dangers which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might confront us at any moment, there was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger that the veterbrate beasts inhabited the jungles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although I had so far discovered no sign of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of mammals, lizards or even birds, yet it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed highly improbable that such did not exist. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they did, how could I be sure that they, too, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not relatively as large as the insects?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I trembled at the thought of meeting a carnivorous N</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast or bird under such conditions. Even a shrew--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiniest of mammals--would be large and powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to destroy us, as readily as our ordinary shrews</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy a husky stag-beetle. But a little later, when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">met our first mammal, all my conjectures had not pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared me for what I saw. The creature was some sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gopher or ground-squirrel, and quite unexpectedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">it darted from the jungle across our pathway. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so strangely had my surroundings affected me mentally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so accustomed had I become to seeing familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">things enlarged to incredible size, that I was speech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less with amazement, for the creature was no larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than an ordinary woodchuck. Recovering my self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession in time, I brought the marmot down with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky shot from my pistol, and we were assured of</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least one meal. I felt immensely relieved, also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find the marmot of normal size. If the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mammalian life was normal in this land of abnormali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties, there was no reason to think that others were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal as well. But as I speculated upon this, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again resumed our way, I wondered how ordinary sized</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertebrates ever managed to survive in a land of giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects. But I believe now, from what I have observed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the only vertebrates which have managed to exist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are those that dwell in subterranean holes or burrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and are nocturnal in their habits. Whether all other</seg><seg type="columnLine">species have been completely exterminated, or whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were never indigenous to the land, I cannot say;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but my opinion is that the latter is the case and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the absence of large carnivorous birds and mammals</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one of the chief causes of the ultra-development of</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect life here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So engrossed had I become in my thoughts, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely was Tom scrutinizing the thickets fearing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise by some dangerous creature, that I failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch my step. Suddenly and without warning, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet flew from under me and with a terrified yell I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found myself sliding, rolling down the steep side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pit-like depression. To be sure it was not more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than five feet in depth, but to me it held all the terrors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an inferno. At the very instant I had lost my foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing I realized what it was. And as I struggled to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain my feet, and to scramble up the sandy slope, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair seemed literally to stand on end and I fairly screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with terror, for I had fallen into the trap of a mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous ant-lion. A few feet from me, and clearly vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible, as with fear-dilated eyes I glanced backward, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous scimitar shaped jaws were protruding from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loose sand at the bottom of the pit. Once within</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach of those homy, dagger-sharp, living blades and</seg><seg type="columnLine">450	AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I would be seized, sliced as with gigantic scissors, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood slowly sucked from my palpitating body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many a time had I watched helpless struggling ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other insects as they slid to the bottom of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant-lion's trap and were seized and sucked dry by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat-bodied, powerfully-built, ravenous creature con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed under the sand. Now, as I fought madly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape from the shallow pit, I realized how those un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate insects must have felt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime Tom stood paralyzed above me, his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaping, his eyes rolling, and utterly bereft of enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his senses to aid me. But the worst was yet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. As I slowly, as if in a nightmare, clawed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way upward, slipping back an inch for every two I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained, the lurking terrible creature at the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">began throwing showers of sand and dust at me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly as I had seen countless ordinary ant-lions</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw dust at escaping ants. With quick upward jerks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his flat spatulate head and broad pincer-like jaws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would toss a few handfuls of sand over me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">devilish accuracy. Half blinded by the dust, frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of my wits, expecting each moment to reel back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into those waiting jaws, I might as well have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to find hand- and foot-holds in water as in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding loose sand. Then, when I was becoming ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted and felt convinced that I was doomed, Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered his wits, and bracing himself firmly, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended a tough branch within my reach. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant I was panting, spent, breathless and shaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but safe on firm ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It had been a close shave. Maddened, and in a paroxysm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hate and resentment, I whipped out my pistol and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to blaze away at the now quiescent ant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion when Tom reminded me that my ammunition would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be more valuable for getting food and that a few good</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized rocks would serve equally as well as far as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant-lion was concerned. Suiting his actions to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, he picked up a convenient stone and hurled it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the beast. But the creature was protected by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">layer of sand, and the only result was to cause it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hastily bury itself deeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AX/'E proceeded with far greater caution after that</seg><seg type="columnLine">' ' experience. It was fortunate that we did so, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only were the ant-lion traps fairly numerous, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition, we soon discovered that the earth, in spots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was riddled with holes and burrows in any one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we might wrench an ankle or break a leg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To recall all the forms of insect life we saw would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible, and to fill my notes with descriptions would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a waste of paper of which I have none too much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ground-beetlcs seemed to be the most abundant things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and though they rushed madly about in a strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited and yet purposeless manner, and several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost knocked our legs from under us, they appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be quite terrified whenever they came near us. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps it was the strange scent of human beings, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they smelled so abominably themselves, that I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand how they could detect any outside odor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dipterous insects were also very common, and these</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared quite familiar and of ordinary size until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that their iridescent, jewel-like, gauzy-winged in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects, the size of our common bluebottle flies, belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to genera, members of which, ordinarily, are so small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they are scarcely visible to the untrained eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once, too, a great dragon-fly dashed into sight, alighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with stiff outspread wings and keen eyes upon a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree top, and then darted after a passing fly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped it up at a single gulp. He was a truly mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificent creature, although a bit terrifying at first; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming thing spreading fully ten feet. From his round</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, with its terrible jaws, to the tip of his tapering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plated body, he was a mass of dazzling blue, scarlet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silver. Tom remarked that if he could only be</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught and tamed, he might serve as a living airplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry us back to civilization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Butterflies were numerous, and while I recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">some genera, others were quite strange to me. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">liehoconidae appeared the most common, as they usu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally are in the tropics. One species--a gray and white</seg><seg type="columnLine">mottled chap spreading about three feet--had a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting habit of settling upon the earth, waving its</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings slowly, and emitting a remarkable clicking or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticking sound like snapping clam shells together. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral very large species were observed, the largest being</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shining green beauty spreading at least eight feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the wings and evidently one of the morphos.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the most beautiful and interesting butterflies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny fellows the size of our ordinary danais or medium</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized papilios. They flitted nervously and jerkily from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one resting place to another as we approached them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">invariably alighting with their heads towards us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their feathery antennae and ruby-like eyes watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing our every movement in a most intelligent and fas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinating manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They were most delicately fashioned and beautifully</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored things, too. Their legs and bodies appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be dressed in garments of thick soft fur of almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic lustre, their wings were in some cases edged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with delicate feathers; in other cases they were entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most intricate lacework, and their colors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">indescribably lovely. For the most part they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pastel shades of lavender, buff, red and green,</seg><seg type="columnLine">often set off by shining flecks of gold or silver. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed for a net in which to capture and examine some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these, and it was not until I had watched them for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time that it dawned upon me that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reality prototypes of our own microlepidoptera,</seg><seg type="columnLine">things so minute that they can only be examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a powerful lens and so delicate that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically impossible to capture or preserve them</seg><seg type="columnLine">without ruining their beauty and their details. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">here were microlepidoptera large enough to study at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable distance and with the naked eye, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if somewhere in_this land there were any</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute forms of insect lite, creatures as small in</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion to the lacy, feather-winged beauties as are</seg><seg type="columnLine">our minute moths in proportion to the big shingidae.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strangely enough, too, a great many genera and fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilies of insects appeared to be entirely wanting. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">no repiptera, none of the carnivorous predatory beetles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no termites, no arachnids other than a few spiders, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">millipedes or centipedes and no mosquitos. For this</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was duly thankful, for the thought of mosquitos</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size of dragon flies or larger was disconcerting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say the least. Aside from the gopher I had killed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two field-mice which darted out of sight in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly, and a fleeting glimpse of some creature I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to be a hare or rabbit, we saw no mammals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We did, however, find several snails, one or two of large</seg><seg type="columnLine">size, but no larger than many marine molluscs. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had a hearty laugh over our terror--after it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed--when an enormous overgrown toad leaped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadows and descended like a falling elephant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trail ahead of us. To our affrighted and startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, he appeared a most gigantic and terrifying beast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although in reality he was no larger than a good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized dog, and quite harmless. As he squatted there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eying us speculatively, winking first one eye and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the other as if doubting his own vision, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his yellowish-white throat palpitated to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing, he seemed most astonishingly and ludi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crously human. Finally, having apparently satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself that we really existed, he opened his wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">451</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">toothless mouth, yawned prodigously and, as if de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciding we were most uninteresting and ridiculous</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings, he leaped back to his damp retreat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So far, our search for food had not been very suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful and it began to look as if we would fare badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless we resorted to insect flesh for sustenance. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not gone entirely hungry, however. From time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">time we had found nuts and seeds; once or twice we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found berries, which, from a botanical viewpoint,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew must be edible, and Tom had discovered--with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the born instinct of the West Indian negro--a species</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cane with a sweet sap, which he munched avidly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">declaring it was as good as inferior sugar cane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But by far the greater portion of edible fruits, ber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ries and even tubers that we found had been com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely ruined or partly devoured by the innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects. In fact, the only real edibles of any Account</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we found were located by means of the insects.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If we noticed flies, beetles and other creatures hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in any one direction, we soon learned that by</seg><seg type="columnLine">following them we were usually led to an accumulation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ripe fruits or to a bush laden with berries. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course the greater portion of the fruit was fai beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">our reach, and often we gazed longingly at the luscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking fruits surrounded by butterflies, hymenoptera,</seg><seg type="columnLine">diptera, etc., in the lofty tree tops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE had been wandering thus for several hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I at last suggested that we should light</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fire and roast our game. No dry fuel was near,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and noticing a fairly open forest a short distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, we turned towards it. We had proceeded but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short distance, when, to my surprise, I came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a well-marked, carefully smoothed pathway, a road of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare earth, perhaps two feet in width and leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost in a straight line in either direction as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we could see. Evidently, I thought, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings in the country, men who were far above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black savages, and, whether hostile or friendly, far</seg><seg type="columnLine">preferable as hosts. Mentally deciding that as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we had eaten we would investigate the pathway and</seg><seg type="columnLine">find where and to what it led, we set about gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry sticks in readiness for the fire. Busy with this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Tom was engaged in skinning and cleaning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marmot, I failed to maintain as careful a watch as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should, until, instinctively warned by the sixth sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one develops in the bush, I straightened up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned my eyes towards the pathway. My amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">at what I beheld forced an exclamation from my lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at this Tom also glanced up. One glimpse, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping the carcass, he leaped to his feet, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling eyes and terrified features, he sprang behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sheltering tree. Hurrying towards us down the path-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way came a huge reddish-brown creature; a creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully five feet in length with enormous head, great</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded fixed eyes, short club-shaped antennae, rough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful legs, attenuated waist and turnip-shaped ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">domen. From head to tail he was sheathed in shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">horny armor like a coat of mail. Clamped fast in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous, triangular jaws he held a huge section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">green leaf that waved like a banner above his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind him came another and another, an endless</seg><seg type="columnLine">procession, each carrying its green burden until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving stream of leaves appeared like a strip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle marching through the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly I recognized them for what they were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were leaf-cutting ants, the bane of all tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">agriculturalists, but hundreds of times larger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any leaf-cutting ant ever before seen by mortal eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like their prototypes so abundant throughout tropi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal America, the gigantic terrifying creatures before us</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bent only on their own affairs. They turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">neither to right nor left, as they rushed past us, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent only on reaching their underground nest and plac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their bits of leaf within the chambers where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decaying vegetation, carefully watched and tended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would develop the edible fungi on which the ants sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted. I have said they were hurrying, but the term</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveys no idea of the terrific speed at which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They moved with the rapidity of racing motor cars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a speed of fully fifty miles an hour I should say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this added to the illusion of a moving, steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowing stream of leaves. For a moment I was astounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the speed of these huge ants, but an instant's re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flection convinced me that it was quite to be expected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was really no faster in proportion to their size</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the movements of ordinary ants. I had repeatedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">timed the progress of various insects, and I knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the larger ants easily traversed forty to fifty feet or</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately one thousand times their own length in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one minute. Hence, at the same proportionate rate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no reason why the giant insects I was watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing should not move one thousand times their length</seg><seg type="columnLine">or fully a mile in a minute. Tom was absolutely help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less with terror and was gazing with horror-filled eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the ever-flowing, endless procession of rushing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocious looking giant ants. For a space, I confess,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I partly shared his fears, but unless these overdeveloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants possessed intellects and habits wholly unlike those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their normal relatives, we had nothing to fear, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were not so foolish as to step into their pathway</seg><seg type="columnLine">or interrupt their business-like progress. But I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not convince Tom that the creatures would not tear us</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb from limb if they caught sight of us or sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected our presence. In fact, he shook and quaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with new terror when I spoke, filled with dread that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the onrushing ants might hear me. I laughed gaily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured him that the ants were stone deaf as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">our voices were concerned. And gradually, as he noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the passing creatures gave no heed to my voice, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to believe me. But it was not until I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown the entrails of the gopher into the ants' path-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and he had watched them halt and remove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">obstruction and again resume their interminable march</seg><seg type="columnLine">without offering to devour the offal, that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that we were in no danger. So, feeling quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe as far as the ants were concerned, we lit our</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire and prepared to cook our meat and eat our long</seg><seg type="columnLine">delayed breakfast within a stone's throw of the ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">column. But if the ants had paid no attention to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximity before, and had given no sign that our voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">were audible to them, they showed immediate and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakable evidences of knowing something was wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment the fire was lighted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the first whiff of smoke blown across their road-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, they came to an abrupt halt, milled about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroked one another with their feet, touched antennae,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seemed tremendously excited. Some dropped their</seg><seg type="columnLine">burdens and started off in various directions through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest, and two of these scouts headed directly to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards us. Tom sprang to his feet screaming, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized him by the coat and forced him to remain beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, although I admit it required no little courage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-possession to stand there in the face of the fero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious-looking, expressionless beasts who rushed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us. But I trusted to the intelligence of the ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to our fire and I was not disappointed. As the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">came within range of the thickest smoke, they halted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reared themselves on their hind legs--reminding me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great tawny bears as they did so--pawed the air, rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their antennae, and wheeling, scurried around to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side of the fire. Once more they dashed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they felt the heat of the flame, whereupon they</seg><seg type="columnLine">452</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">again retreated. Over and over again they repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">these tactics, often passing within a foot of us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each time they came near, Tom trembled and shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">until his teeth chattered. But as far as the ants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned we might have been forest trees or bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. All their attentions and senses were centered</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the fire and smoke, totally new things to them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last, having satisfied themselves that it was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon that was to remain fixed, and that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not likely to attack them, they hurried back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting column. Then, having apparently conveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the information they had gathered to their fellows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they picked up their discarded bits of leaves, fell into</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, and once again the procession was in full motion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Convinced that he had nothing to fear, Tom sank back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the earth, while I chaffed him and poked fun at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for being afraid of leaf-carrying ants with \Vhose</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits he should have been so thoroughly familiar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somewhat shamefacedly he admitted that he was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware '.hat the "drougher ant" of Jamaica and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropic lands was a strict vegetarian and confined itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to certain definite vegetable growths at that, but, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added, as he ravenously attacked a gopher leg; "Dis</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gent'man, he don't been tha same, Chief.

No, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUR hunger satisfied, the question arose as to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">next move. We were homeless, friendless waifs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a strange, bizarre and dangerous land. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to the hospitality of the black savages was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be considered. And we well knew that it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a waste of energy to attempt to regain the outer world</seg><seg type="columnLine">by way of the tunnel from Tupec. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, however, that there might be other means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the place, and our only feasible plan appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be to thoroughly explore the country in the hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of discovering some trail or passage by which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might escape. I have already said that at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">first view of the place it had appeared to be sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by lofty mountains. But I knew from expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rience that mountain ranges might seem continuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unbroken from a distance and yet might be cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">by numerous passes, ravines and canyons, and it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarely indeed that a long mountain range cannot be</seg><seg type="columnLine">surmounted in some spot. To be sure, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an almost hopeless task to think of tramping around</seg><seg type="columnLine">that vast territory searching for an exit, maintain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a precarious existence meanwhile, and constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing unknown perils. I knew only too well</seg><seg type="columnLine">how slow one's progress is in a tropical untamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, and I knew that months, years in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be required to really explore the place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in a way, time meant nothing to us. Aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fact that my supply of ammunition was</seg><seg type="columnLine">limited and that our garments and shoes would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">last forever, there was no valid reason why we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">rot devote the rest of our lives to our search. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">that matter, if we did not attempt it, the rest of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives would be passed here anyway. At any rate, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be doing something to occupy our minds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, and anything was better than to remain inac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive and hopelessly awaiting whatever might befall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I thought on such matters and discussed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Tom, it occurred to me that my position was</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly amusing. I had set out on this trip, lured on</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the wild tales of weird people and strange beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the unknown interior of the country; I had de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to penetrate the district beyond Tupec, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had looked forward with enthusiastic interest to mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing epochal discoveries. And now that I had pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated to the locality, had actually reached the fabu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous land and had met the beings--as well as even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more amazing things--all my interests and efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bent on getting away from the very spot I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long desired to enter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no doubt that I had made epochal dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveries, but of what use to discover things unless such</seg><seg type="columnLine">discoveries could be made known to the world? Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">it struck me forcibly, for the first time in my life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man's desire to explore, to see strange sights, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover amazing facts, was not a question of personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratification or a thirst for individual knowledge, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really due to an inherent, egotistical vanity; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">love of publicity and a longing to be applauded, praised</seg><seg type="columnLine">and regarded as famous by his fellow men. Through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out my own career I had rather prided myself on fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shy of publicity, and had flattered myself that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">my studies and investigations had been carried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">solely for the benefit of science and adding to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own store of knowledge. Yet here was I, amid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most amazing things that any scientist ever dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of, and thinking only of getting away from them, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning to humdrum lands and uninteresting civi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lized human beings. Still, I did feel an intense interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the place and its strange denizens, and I knew that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had I been free to leave whenever I desired, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have elected to remain for a long time and should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have found the greatest delight in studying the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plant life of the land. Thus musing on the complex</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychology of mankind and the reaction of the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain to conditions and environment, I lit my pipe, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one place seemed as good as another for a be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning, led the way through the forest towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest mountains. I should have liked to have crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pathway of the leaf-carrying ants, for beyond that</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of march, the forest was more open, the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloped upward, and I surmised that from the higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">land I might secure a widespread view of the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could thus be enabled to pick some promising ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jective point. But despite my knowledge of the ants'</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits and hecWvorous characters, I' had no desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attempt a passage of their highway. To try to dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">across amid that throng of hurrying insects would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be far more perilous than to undertake to dodge among</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless racing automobiles on a congested avenue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ants at best are short-tempered things, and while they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might not go out of their way or neglect their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs to attack us--as long as we minded our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">business and did not interfere with them--yet I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite confident that they would resent any trespassing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their right of way and would show their resentment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a most unpleasant and terrible manner. Even if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did not fall upon us and tear us limb from limb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but merely regarded us as temporary obstructions--</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as they had treated the gopher's entrails--I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no desire to be picked up by those great terrifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws and tossed to one side. So, abandoning all</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts of crossing the stream of ants, we turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">our backs upon them, and keeping to the open forest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramped onward. Here in the forest, life was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratively scarce. Far above our heads we could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sounds of insect life, the crunching of leaves by</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant larva?, the droning of buzzing flies and bees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high-pitched screech of tree-crickets, and innumer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able noises I could not identify.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once, too, a terrific roaring bellow struck terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our hearts and we halted, cowering behind a tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for such a sound I felt could only issue from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat of some huge carnivorous mammal. But pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">453</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ently, as the roar was repeated and I gazed fixedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction whence it came, expecting to see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouching tiger or other feline, I burst into a peal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter. Clinging to the rough bark of an outjutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb, his great golden eyes blinking, squatted a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree-frog; a gigantic hyla with moist skin so perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">matching the color of the lichen-covered bark that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">it not been for his eyes and the movements of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, as he again gave vent to his bellow, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been invisible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">On another occasion we were startled by what</seg><seg type="columnLine">might well have been the screech of a steamship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">siren, a terrifying sound that rose and fell and quav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered and drowned all other noises. For a moment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was perplexed, but as I caught sight of an object</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to a tree trunk I knew instantly what crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture had produced the ear-splitting cry. As Tom also</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the thing on the tree he gave a howl of terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clung to me shaking with fear. I really could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not blame him, for nothing we had yet seen, was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrifying in aspect or more monstrous in form. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat abdomen was perhaps three feet in length; its</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy spike-covered legs ended in great anchor-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">claws, that were buried deep in the bark; its goggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes wore a fishy, ghastly expression--reminding me</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a long-dead human--and between short, murderous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking palpi or fore-legs we could see a long, needle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed tusk or beak. But despite its fearsome aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew the thing was harmless, devoid of life, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking up a stick, I stepped forward and with a laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimed a blow at the thing. As the stick struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster it crackled, collapsed and dropped in a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces to the ground. It was merely the cast-off skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a cicada larva, or so-called "locust," and the siren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like screech from the tree top was the triumphant</seg><seg type="columnLine">love call of the mature insect which had recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged from the discarded pupa-case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANOTHER time Tom had a surprise, which amazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him so that for several moments he was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">incapable of speech, and sat gazing, unable to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, until my peals of laughter brought him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his senses. In order to remove a twig from one shoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had reached out one hand to rest it against a tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">to steady himself. The next instant a two-foot section</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rough, gray bark had detached itself from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree trunk, had sprung suddenly into life, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad rustling wings had flitted off, showing a flash of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame color as it did so. Fifty feet away it had van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished as suddenly and as completely as though it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolved in air, and Tom. as I said, sat gazing in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credulously at the spot where it had disappeared. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had recognized it as a catoccda moth, a giant specimen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be sure, but possessing the same habits and prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically the same colors as our familiar catocalas of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern forests. Like them its upper wings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored and patterned to precisely match the bark of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tree on which it rested, like them its under wings--</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible only in flight--were gaudily colored in orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">and black, and like them it flitted but a short distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before again alighting on a tree trunk, where it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came instantly so camouflaged as to become invisible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom was loth to believe this possible, and in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prove the facts, and to accustom him to unexpected</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiences, I approached the tree where the moth had</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished until within a few feet of it. Then, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom stared at the bark incredulously, I tossed a peb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble, and once more the apparent piece of bark took</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight. Tom shook his woolly head and gazed after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flitting insect reflectively. "Pears to me, Chief,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he observed, "we folks don't been design' for to abide</seg><seg type="columnLine">here no ways so conven'ent like tha bugs. Could Ah</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">absolve mahself into a tree bark like dat gent'man do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah wouldn't be afraid of nothin'.

Yes, Chief Ah mos' surely would."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To me, the most astonishing thing about all the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had seen was the fact that in their habits, charac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters and even appearance, the insects, mammals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">batrachians were so very similar to those I was fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar with elsewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About the only difference was the discrepancy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">size, and, in the case of mammals at least, even that</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinction was wanting. Only the human denizens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the land appeared to have developed unusual physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal characters and habits--characters and habits strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly insect-like as I have already said. If, as I as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed, this was due to the predominance of insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the environment, why then had not the insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed higher forms, greater intelligence and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least some of the characters that we associate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings? As I speculated on this, my memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to my college days and I recollected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words of my professor of zoology. In the course of at</seg><seg type="columnLine">lecture he had stated that one of the peculiarities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's mind was that it could not conceive of anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">totally unlike anything ever before seen, smelt, heard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tasted or felt. In other words, man's imagination was</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely restricted to the experiences of his five</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses. No man, he had declared, could describe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">color, a sound, an odor, a texture or a form entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">new or unknown. Even the writers of the most imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inative fiction were at a loss to do this. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted to describe the denizens of another planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">they invariably compared them to something familiar:</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were like this that or the other with, slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">altered details; a color was invariably described as</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling one or more of the visible rays of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectrum. "And yet," he continued, "we have no rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son to assume that the inhabitants of another world--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or even of some unknown part of this world--have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest resemblance to anything we have ever seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is no valid scientific reason why any of the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of life--even the insects--should not, somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the universe, have evolved and developed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same or even greater heights than the primates in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our circumscribed world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The truth of this statement, coming from a scient-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ist of world-wide reputation, could not be denied or</seg><seg type="columnLine">even doubted. And yet, here, in a land where most</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously every condition was most admirably adapted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ultra-development of insect and batrachian life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insects were still insects in character, in intellect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in habits; the batrachians were still batrachians, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">while man had Regenerated, the other forms of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not progressed beyond acquiring greater size.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were the ants for example; the most intelligent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best organized, the most human-like, if I may use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the term, of the insect-world. Theoretically ants, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a land like this, and where they reached undreamed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportions, might be expected to exhibit marvelous</seg><seg type="columnLine">intellect, amazing progress, and might even be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced than human beings. Yet the leaf-carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants, which were the only species I had observed, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still ants, gigantic in size to be sure, but still behav,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing exactly like any ordinary leaf-carrying ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NO, there was not a thing I had met so far which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not have described fully and intelligently</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my former experiences and observations; not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing which was absolutely new to my eyes, nose, ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue or touch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After all, I thought, there is much truth in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old saying that there is nothing new under the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">454	AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But there is equal truth in the equally trite proverbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding pride going before a fall and a modicum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge being a dangerous thing, as I was to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover very soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Absorbed in my reflections and cogitations, I had failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to note our surroundings until I was aroused by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised ejaculation from Tom. I glanced up to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had reached the end of the forest and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">before us was a grove, or I might say orchard, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">large shrubs or small trees with thick, fleshy stalks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soft green foliage. That they had been planted</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposely and were cultivated growths was evident,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they were arranged in orderly rows and the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath them was bare of grass or weeds. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief instant new hope sprang to my breast, for here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought, was proof that intelligent civilized or semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized men dwelt in the land. But the next Second</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart sank and I involuntarily slipped back of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree. From between the rows of plants one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous black savages appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was not the semi-human being that riveted</seg><seg type="columnLine">my attention and caused me to gasp with incredulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement, but the creatures that accompanied him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An Emmet Shepherdess carrying one of her Aphid Flock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">From "Nature's Craftsmen,'' by Henry C.

But that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were not pachyderms of any sort was instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent. In fact they were not mammals, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen or more ungainly creatures forming the herd</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the black savage was driving and urging on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward all possessed six legs!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Incredible as it seemed they were insects--great</seg><seg type="columnLine">round-bodied, short-legged beasts the size of heifers;</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft and flabby-skinned, with drooping dewlaps, small</seg><seg type="columnLine">elongated heads, goggle-eyes staring upward from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occiput and with short rudimentary antennae and</seg><seg type="columnLine">elephant-like trunks which were folded up between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front legs. Some possessed rudimentary wings in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of fleshy pads above the abdomen, some were</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown, some pale green, some mottled, and several were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a livid, sickly whitish. But all were alike in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect, for near the rear end of the abdomen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each was a swollen protruberance with teat-like ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendages. It was in fact this peculiarity more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything else which enabled me to identify the things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despite their enormous size, despite their striking re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblance to lumbering pachyderms, I knew they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be aphids, plant-lice, as they are more commonly known.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was equally apparent that they were domesticated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they behaved precisely like our own domestic cattle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every moment or two one or more of the beasts would</seg><seg type="columnLine">stray aside and, extending its proboscis, would feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">about on the stem of a bush as if searching for food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And each time, as the black herder started in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of the beast, it would fold up its proboscis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kicking up its heels in a most ludicrous and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gainly manner, would hurry after its companions, who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking advantage of the herder's diverted attention,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would invariably stop to graze, as I might express it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by climbing up the nearest bushes and inserting their</seg><seg type="columnLine">noses in the soft, fleshy stems. The poor black was</seg><seg type="columnLine">having his hands full, but between tossing pebbles</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his charges, whacking them with a light switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he carried, and constantly darting first to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and then the other, he managed to keep them</seg><seg type="columnLine">going in the direction he desired. Scarcely had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first herd and its driver passed when another came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view followed by a third and fourth. So astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">had I become at discovering that the semi-human blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">had actually domesticated the giant aphids and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently using them as milch cows, exactly as do</seg><seg type="columnLine">many species of our common ants, that I completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot myself and my surroundings and hurried from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelter of the forest in order to secure a closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the remarkable beasts. Instantly, all was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion. The blacks, the moment they caught sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, deserted their charges and scurried off with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">indication of terror, and the aphids, as startled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparition of a strange being as ordinary cattle are at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approach of a stranger, stampeded, thundering off</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every direction at a speed of which I should never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought them capable. But they did not go far.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of rushing off among the rows of small trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they commenced clamboring up the stems. So indescrib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably ridiculous and so absolutely astounding was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of these great lumbering beasts climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up the straight smooth stalks, that I fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly roared with laughter. A few of the beasts con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued upward for a dozen feet or more until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained the lowest branches, but the majority instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot their fear as soon as they found themselves 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stalks, and with bovine complacency, at once fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work sucking the sap, oblivious to all else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment or two I watched them, and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling rather sorry for the terrified herders and tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">commotion I had caused, and being anxious to study</seg><seg type="columnLine">their actions further, I withdrew and rejoined Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he was hiding, still terrified, in the forest. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt the concealed blacks had been watching my every</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement, for a few moments after I had again en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the forest, they crept timorously forth, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deal of difficulty again rounded up their charges. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course I knew that the aphids were perfectly harmless</seg><seg type="columnLine">and incapable of either offensive or defensive actions</seg><seg type="columnLine">--unless by chance they should step 011 one--but never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless I was rather amazed at the manner in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the triangular-headed blacks manhandled the big beasts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing and shoving them about and dragging them</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from their perches by tugging at legs or snouts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I was still more astonished at the almost monkey-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">agility of the blacks as they ran up the stems of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees, and herding the escaped aphids from the limbs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced them to descend to the ground. Presently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">herds were again moving steadily onward and anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discover where they were going, and with what pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose the savages were driving them, I waited until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were barely visible in the distance and followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">after.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BY now, as will have been surmised, I had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely lost any lingering fears of the savages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And even Tom, seeing my example, did not dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">them greatly. This was due partly to our experience when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had left the subterranean chamber and had realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">455</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that the blacks were far more afraid of us than we</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them; still more it was due to the evident fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us exhibited by the aphids' herders. But 1 think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last sensations of dread 1 had felt had vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainly because of the innumerable and far more dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous things I had met.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Compared to a five-foot, leaf-carrying ant, the blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed comparatively harmless. A roving wasp or</seg><seg type="columnLine">hornet was a far more dangerous foe than a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the savages, and I would rather have faced a score</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beings single-handed than to have repeated my</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience with the ant-lion. To be sure, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the largest living things we had encountered, fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-sized for men and almost equal to my own stature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But almost any insect is fully one hundred times as</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong for its size as a human being, and I was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that any predatory beetle or hemiptera of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size to be expected would be a match for a small army</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the savages or for several well-armed beings like</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hence, quite unconsciously, I had been mentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparing the savages with the giant insects of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, and without realizing it, I had come to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them with something of contempt. Perhaps I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">best explain my feeling by comparing myself with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who, surrounded by hyenas and seeing the beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">tearing some creature limb from limb, becomes terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied at their ferociousness and brute strength until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes face to face with a lion or a tiger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Added to all this, was the fact' that my scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest had been aroused and that--even had I still</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared the blacks--I doubtless should have forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own peril in my anxiety to study them and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits. At any rate, the fact remains that I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear whatsoever of the beings who were urging on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">aphid cattle far ahead of us. Rather, my mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent on not frightening them, and it struck me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather amusing to think how quickly our positions had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been reversed and that, within twenty-four hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my first sight of the savages, I was the hunter rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the hunted and was taking every care not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrify them into flight. Then, for the first time, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized how rapidly the hours had passed. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already late in the afternoon; my appetite warned me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I should be searching for food rather than fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing the creatures ahead. And it behooved us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find some place in which to pass the approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Regretfully I decided that it would not do to</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue farther. I was about to turn aside and hunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">for provender and a spot in which to camp, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">herds and their drivers suddenly vanished as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth had swallowed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a matter of fact that was precisely what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, as I discovered a few moments later when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we reached the spot where they had disappeared. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">were several yawning openings in the side of a hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">or mound, and from the sounds issuing hollowly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">within, I knew that the savages and their charges had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the subterranean passages. It was useless to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow them without a light, for it would, I knew, be</seg><seg type="columnLine">inky black within the passages. Deciding to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the vicinity until morning and then investigate, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned all entomological researches for the time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with Tom, vastly relieved by my decision, set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in search of dinner. We were rather fortunate. As in</seg><seg type="columnLine">other lands, with the approach of sundown the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jority of the insects went to rest, while nocturnal mam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals-- and apparently most, if not all of the verte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brates of the place, were nocturnal--came forth from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hiding places. Scarcely two hundred yards from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the forest we came upon several large</seg><seg type="columnLine">hare-like creatures browsing in an open space. As they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were not at all shy and we approached within a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance of them, I easily shot one while Tom knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a second with- a well-thrown club of wood. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thunderous echoes of my pistol-shot, pandemonium</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke loose in the forest, and on every side were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds of beating wings, sharp cries, strange clickings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rustle of unseen creatures aroused and fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened by the unwonted sound. Seeing how easily Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">had killed game with mankind's first and most primi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive weapons, I was sorry that I had wasted my am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munition. Hence, as I gathered fuel and Tom pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared the hare I had shot, my mind turned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of equipping ourselves with bows and arrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would enable us to secure game, protect our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves quite effectively, and hoard the cartridges, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be far more valuable later on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very soon the fire was blazing, and as the flames lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the shadowy forest and the pungent smoke drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward through the trees we soon discovered that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had created a most unpleasant situation for ourselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From every side insects came winging towards us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted by the light. Myriads of gnats and midges</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size of bumble-bees swarmed about, tumbling into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flames blundering with seared wings over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and upon ourselves, crawling over us and mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing life miserable. Great crane-flies with yard-long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">attenuated legs and flimsy wings flitted through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke and dropped, crippled and injured, about us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moths of every imaginable size and color, from tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">things no larger than our own "millers," to great</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagle-like sphingidae and bombycids as big as alba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trosses, dashed back and forth on whirring pinions</seg><seg type="columnLine">that blew the fire about and drove the smoke in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces, while humming, clumsy, armor-clad cockchafers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">longicorns and other beetles dove blindly at the light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dodging the larger things, brushing the smaller from</seg><seg type="columnLine">our persons, and kicking aside the cripples that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent on wandering over us, we managed to stick it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out until the hare was broiled. Then we retreated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the shadows, and with our backs against a tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded to dine off the half-burned, half-cooked meat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But even then we were not to be left in peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NO sooner did we commence to eat than scores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects -swarmed about us, attracted by the odor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the meat. Mainly, they were coleoptera. and neurop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tera. Hard shelled beetles representing several fami-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies and genera, were numerous and among them I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized some familiar forms. There were many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tumble-dung groups; a number very similar to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady birds or lady-bugs, as they are popularly called;</seg><seg type="columnLine">some shimmering, iridescent chaps gleaming like bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished metal, and a few magnificent purple and gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">buprestids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of course were far larger than anything in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands, and the same was the case with the disgusting</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking cockroaches, the big brown crickets and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two stupendous green katydids. But none of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as troublesome as the caddis-flies which swarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about; frail phantom-like things that were constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">completing their brief lives and were dropping dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us and our food. They were even more of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuisance than the buzzing gnats and flies which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to share our meal. Many of these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no larger than normal insects, and, glancing towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dying fire, I was surprised to see myriads of tiny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute forms of insect life attracted by the light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smouldering coals. How far, I wondered, did this</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminution in size extend?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Were there actually microscopic insects in this land?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I remembered the old jingle about fleas having little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleas to bite them, and a somewhat surprising idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">456</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to me. Did the same conditions exist in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands? Were there actually forms of insect life as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much smaller than the common sphinx moths as these</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute things I was watching were smaller than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-foot moths darting through the air about me? So</seg><seg type="columnLine">small were many of the midges and flies, that they ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared like motes of dust in the firelight, and if species</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed in other lands as small in proportion, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be wholly invisible to the unaided eye--perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible--even through a powerful lens of a micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope. It was a fascinating thought and I wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had never occurred to me before. By now it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">black dark in the forest, and among the trees, fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies made their appearance. But such fire-flies! In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tropics the big fire-flies, or rather fire-beetles be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longing to the elater or snapping-beetle group, are fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous for the brilliance of the steady luminosity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their thoracic spots and the abdominal segments. Often,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the past, I had kept a phial containing one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these fellows to enable me to discern the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my watch by their light during the night, and here</seg><seg type="columnLine">were light-giving elaters hundreds of times the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any known tropical species. Their twin thoracic</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots gleamed like the headlights of a motor car and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly dazzled our eyes when they came winging to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards us. The greenish luminescence of their abdo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mens illuminated the earth beneath them, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled along or winged among the trees, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they carried concealed arc-lights. As hundreds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures appeared and flew aimlessly about, trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, branches and every object in the forest, became</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlined in a soft radiance as bright as moonlight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very fortunately for us, there appeared to be no biting</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects, and the absence of these I attributed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcity of vertebrates. But whatever the reason, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither saw nor heard mosquitoes; the gnats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">midges, though insistent and a nuisance, did not offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to test the quality of our blood, and as there seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be no other solution of the problem, we decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep where we were. To be sure, there was no little</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger in doing so. A wandering hungry ant might</seg><seg type="columnLine">find us and make short work of us, and I shivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I thought of the possibility of their being army-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants in the country. I had witnessed many demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strations of the voracity and destructiveness of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects, of the ordinary army-ants which march through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tropical forests in countless millions, their armies</seg><seg type="columnLine">often hundreds of yards in width and extending in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense formation for miles, and which march on irre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistibly killing and devouring every living thing in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathway. I had seen houses invaded by these ferocious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly organized, perfectly trained insect soldiers, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed on, leaving nothing behind them but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones of dogs and cats and not a living insect or exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing vermin. And I had known of more than one in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance of human beings having been surrounded, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come and devoured by the army-ants. In this land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant insect forms, if army-ants existed, what monsters</seg><seg type="columnLine">they must be! In my mind's eye I could picture them--■</seg><seg type="columnLine">six, perhaps even ten feet in length--judging from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size of the leaf-carrying ants we had seen--sweep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing across the land in a vast, all-devastating army and</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming upon us as we slumbered. And the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far from reassuring or pleasant. There was also</seg><seg type="columnLine">the danger of some prowling beast, of whose existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were ignorant, falling upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was nothing else to be done, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had beheld so many amazing things during the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the previous night, and had become so accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to being terrified by real dangers, that the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing a night in the forest did not greatly frighten</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. I deemed it wise, however, to have one of us re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">main awake while the other slept, and although I</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted his ability to keep his eyes open for long, Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered to take the first watch. Handing him my re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver, and cautioning him not to use it except as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultimate resort, and telling him to arouse me at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first sign or sound of danger or if anything unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred, I curled myself up in a moss-covered space</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two tree-roots and fell instantly asleep. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral times I woke with a start, thinking some huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast had stepped upon me, only to find it was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandering beetle clambering over my recumbent body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last I came to my senses with a start, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that I had overslept, and wondering why Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not called me. But as I rubbed my eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed about, I broke into laughter. It was broad day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and Tom was snoring lustily, doubled up where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sat. He had been utterly oblivious of his surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings throughout the night, and yet nothing had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. We were still safe and sound, and I felt quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident that we had little to fear in case we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to spend another night under the open sky. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no intention of doing this. Before the sun set</seg><seg type="columnLine">on us again we would have some provision made for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping safely and securely as well as comfortably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If we ran no danger of being attacked by the liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing denizens of the land, there were other very grave</seg><seg type="columnLine">risks from the dampness, miasma and chilly air. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, in the forest, it was cold, and my hands felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">numb and my teeth chattered as I hastily gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">firewood and started a cheery blaze. This brought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind another matter of importance to be attended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to. I possessed but one box of matches and Tom, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a smoker, had none. I must discover some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other means of kindling fire without delay. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be flint or stone of some-sort which would serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the aid of my hunting-knife and proper tinder, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">again I might be able to rig up a bow-drill with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to ignite punk. The thought of a bow-drill</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought back my decision of the previous afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fashion bows and arrows. This I knew would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rather difficult problem, and I mentioned it to Tom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I thought he might know more of the properties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tropical woods than I. It was fortunate that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so, for he solved the problem instanter by sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesting that we return to the spot where the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panos had been killed and secure their bows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUR breakfast was very meagre and consisted of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few fruits we were lucky enough to find. But soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">after we started off in the direction, which I assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">would carry us to the scene of the Indians' deaths, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised a huge land-frog dozing in a clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">palmettos. Tom gazed at him quizzically a few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and then, picking up a hefty club, grinned as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cautiously approached the fifty-pound batrachian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Seem to me, Chief," he observed, "he mighty like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crapaud in he aspec's. Yes, Chief, he cert'y possess</seg><seg type="columnLine">tha same look an Ah been goin' to as'tain' is he as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit fo' to eat as they."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching the side of the still unconscious frog, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealt the creature a terrific blow on the head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the batrachian collapsed without a sound. As Tom had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, there was no reason why the huge frog should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be edible, in fact, most palatable, for the big West</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian land frog or "crapaud" is a highly prized deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cacy and is most delicious. I judged that this immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow belonged to the same genus--even unobservant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom had noticed the resemblance--but I was also aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that two species of the same genera may vary greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their edible qualities. However, Tom had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken. One of the frog's legs was soon broiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">457</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over a fire, and the flesh proved as white, as tender</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as savory as the most fastidious could wish. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind leg was ample for our meal, for it was twice the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of a turkey's leg, and having cooked the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg and the thick white loins, Tom wrapped these in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh green leaves, tied them with flexible vines, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slung them over his shoulders. We had enough food</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hand for the rest of the day, and more, and feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh and strong after our feast, we proceeded on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way towards the scene of the recent tragedy. For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately I possess a very highly developed sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, and within an hour or two we began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize familiar landmarks. But to travel in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general direction of some spot and to locate a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">small point in that direction are two very different</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters. Moreover, in our flight from the savages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had raced blindly towards the tunnel entfynce and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken no heed of surroundings; also, we had been led</seg><seg type="columnLine">as captives along a trail that passed far from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene of the Pano's end. Hence it was a long and ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently hopeless task searching for the bodies of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians. When, after weary hours of retracing our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way--as nearly as was possible--from the tunnel en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance to the jungle and back again, we at last found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot which I felt certain was where the black savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fought with the Panos, we could find no trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">either dead bodies or skeletons. That we were not mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken in the locality was certain. The earth showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the imprints of our shoes and of bare feet. The plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wilted and drooping where they had been crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broken by the struggling men, and if any doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">had remained in our minds they would have been dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipated when Tom picked up an empty pistol cartridge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a short search revealed others. One thing puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Quite an extensive area was bare of living plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">and appeared to. have been recently dug. Was it pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, I wondered, that the black savages had buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bodies of their fellow and of the Indians? I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely believe that such primitive, degenerate beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bother to do this, but there seemed no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation of the recently turned earth and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence of corpses. If they had done so, no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had also taken possession of the Indians' weapons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was about to give up in despair and was roundly</seg><seg type="columnLine">berating our ill-luck, when Tom uttered an exclamation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushing his way into a clump of wilted vegetation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew out a bow. A moment later we had secured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other bow and five of the eight arrows. Then, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were diligently searching for the balance of the wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pons, I noticed a bit of smooth, straight cane pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truding from the freshly turned earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Recognizing it as the end of an arrow-shaft, I seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and tugged at it. It seemed rather firmly embedded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as with a final pull it moved, I staggered back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily horrified. About it the loose earth had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come away and had exposed the partly decomposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder of the black savage I had killed three days</seg><seg type="columnLine">previously. And as I dropped the broken arrow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew hastily back, the earth about the swollen black</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh began to move and heave as if the body were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming to life. It was a horrifying, ghastly sight, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly knowing what to expect, I gazed fascinated at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot. The next instant a clod of earth fell away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a huge black and red beetle emerged. Instantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I recognized the creature and knew why and by whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bodies had been interred. It was a carrion or</seg><seg type="columnLine">burying-beetle, a vastly enlarged edition of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon burying-beetles with which I was familiar. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">those, it, and probably a number of its fellows work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in unison, had dug away the earth under the bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they had dropped into the excavations, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">then covered them with soil to provide a food supply</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for their larvaj when they emerged from the eggs de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posited beside the decomposing flesh. It was all so</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly, so goulish and so repulsive that I shuddered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and abandoning all thoughts of searching for the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows, I called to Tom and we beat a hasty retreat</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the vicinity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT we had accomplished our purpose. We each</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed a powerful bow and most efficient and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly arrows, for I was well aware that the tips were</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisoned and that even a slight wound caused by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons would produce death in a few moments. Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite as well aware of the deadly character of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things as I was, and he handled them most gin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerly. But even so I felt that we ran a grave risk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in case we should stumble or by chance scratch our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, and I at once took steps to safeguard ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">by cutting some sections of hollow reeds and slipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">these as sheaths over the arrow-points.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither of us had ever used bows and arrows, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were to secure game with them or intended to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to protect ourselves, it was highly important that"</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should test our skill or lack of skill and should</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice until we were proficient archers. So, setting</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a target of reeds tied together in a bundle as large</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a fair sized animal, we spent the next few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting the arrows we made for practice, or rather at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Knowing that any game we might meet, or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies, would be at short range, we confined our</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts to a distance of thirty yards, and much to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise I found that we rapidly acquired proficiency</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were presently making hits at every shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quite satisfied with our progress, and well tired and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry, we dined off cold frog's leg. The next step</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to endeavor to discover some sort of fire-making</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus. In this I was successful, and with Tom's</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid and suggestions, for he had the primitive man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knack of such matters, I at last had the satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of creating a smouldering heap of dust by means of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow-drill and spindle. In fact it took us longer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find some highly inflammable tinder which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring into a blaze from contact with the spark than</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had required to ignite the material in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. At last, satisfied that we could kindle fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever we wished without sacrificing matches, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">again set out, this time heading towards the locality</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we had seen the aphids driven into the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground passages. I was still anxious to investigate</seg><seg type="columnLine">this matter farther, but as we strolled along we did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not forget to keep our eyes and senses alert for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">camping place for the approaching night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would have been a fairly simple matter to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">erected a shed or lean-to--a benab as the Indians call</seg><seg type="columnLine">such temporary structures--but the main question was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to provide beds or substitutes, for I had no wish to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend another night reposing on the damp earth. Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested hammocks, and when I asked if he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to weave a hammock, and if he realized the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time necessary to do so, he replied that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">often used a sheet of flexible inner bark for the pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose. But our most diligent search failed to reveal</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single tree with bark adapted to hammock making.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, it was late in the afternoon before a solution</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the problem occurred to us, and then, as is so often</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case, the solution was thrust upon us and was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no manner due to our own intelligence or inventive</seg><seg type="columnLine">abilities. We had seen several huge spiders' webs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had half facetiously remarked that we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">make hammocks of spider silk, when upon glancing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nearby sapling, I noticed several oblong, grayish</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects hanging from the branches. For a moment I</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather vaguely wondered what they were, and with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">458</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">investigative tendency which has led me into innumer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able successes and misfortunes--including my present</seg><seg type="columnLine">predicament--I stepped closer to examine them, As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had half-expected, I discovered they were the cocoons</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some bombycid moths, or as they are more com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monly known, moths of the silk-worm group. In nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">all countries the moths of this family are among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest of insects. In the United States, for example,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cecropia is our largest lepidoptem, spreading over</seg><seg type="columnLine">six inches. In the East Indies the Atlas moth attains</seg><seg type="columnLine">the largest dimensions of all living lepidoptera--aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the moths in this strange land of course--with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing spread of a foot or more. And here I had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed giant bombycids with a wing expanse of over</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet, which in proportion to the other huge insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the place was rather small, if anything. The cocoons</seg><seg type="columnLine">much resembled those of the Atlas moth, or rather \</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, those of the Ailanthus silk worm of the Orient,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has been introduced into the United States. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">these they were pendant, being attached to the branch</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which they hung, by stout silken strands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">like them they were gracefully tapered from the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">central portion to the two extremities. The cocoon of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Atlas moth is about five to six inches in length</seg><seg type="columnLine">by over one inch in diameter, and hence the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cocoons before me was not greatly surprising.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were, in fact, about nine feet in length by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in diameter, or approximately twenty times the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of the average Atlas cocoons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment I stood admiring the beautiful texture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the silk of which they were composed, and the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricate manner in which it was woven. Then I uttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a triumphant shout that brought Tom to my side on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the run. Here, ready made for us, were ideal ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocks; silken couches such as no other human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever possessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom grinned from ear to ear as I explained mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters and, armed with my hunting-knife, he climbed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smooth stem as he had many a time climbed coco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nut palms. But it was a far more difficult matter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut down the big cocoons than to dislodge a bunch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coconuts. The silk was tough and elastic, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting-knife was not the best of tools for cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it. But Tom was strong and persevering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently the first cocoon came tumbling down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next soon followed, and tired and exhausted, Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the resounding thuds with which the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">had struck the earth I knew that they contained liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pupae or chrysalids. But as it would be necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cut the cocoons open in order to use them, the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of the pupae did not trouble me. Tom having done</seg><seg type="columnLine">his share, I straddled a cocoon. Being rather more</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar with their construction than Tom, I readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the loosely-woven aperture at one end, inserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">my knife-blade, and ripped the thing from end to</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. Then, calling Tom to help me, we stripped off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thick, tough outer envelope and revealed the thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">papery structure containing the dormant chrysalis with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. Rolling the latter to one side, we trimmed away</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edges of the cocoon and presently were in posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of a strong, light and most perfect hammock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun silk. Slung by its own silken strands between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two trees, it proved most comfortable and luxurious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before sundown the second hammock was ready. Well</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied, but tired with our unwonted labors, we dined</seg><seg type="columnLine">on cold frog, slaked our thirst at a nearby brook, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung our weary bodies into the hammocks so provi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dentially supplied by nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE were not disturbed during the night, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had no fire, the insects did not bother us</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. Having breakfasted, we folded up our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammocks, slung them like packs on our backs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on our way. Peering into the thickets in search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of game as we proceeded, we followed along near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the forest with the dense jungle on our right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a fair-sized brook here, and anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn if it contained fish, we crept to an overhanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot on the bank and gazed down at a clear, calm pool</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. Presently, from the dark shadows, a large fish</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved slowly into sight. But we had no fishing tackle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was about to withdraw regretfully when I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered how the Indians secure fish by shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with arrows. Although I was only a beginner</seg><seg type="columnLine">with these primitive weapons, I decided to try my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unsheathing an arrow, I fitted it to my bow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose as slowly and quietly as possible. At my first</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement the fish darted out of sight. But he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">either bold or hungry and soon reappeared. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained far below the surface, however, and I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that to attempt to get him at that depth would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">futile. Tom, however, was resourceful, and unwrap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping the last remnants of our food, he cut off a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny shreds of meat and tossed them onto the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly the fish rose to the bait and as he did so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I discharged my missile. I could scarcely have missed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fish was within five feet of my poised arrow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I distinctly saw it strike him just back of the gills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But to my amazement, the point failed to penetrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body, and as the fish darted off, the arrow floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmlessly upon the surface of the pool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom was as puzzled as I was and insisted the fish</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be "Obeah" or a "Jumbie" to have resisted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrow. But I knew there must be some good reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the seeming miracle, and I became more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever anxious to secure the denizen of the pool and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn the explanation. Without fish hooks, without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">net, this seemed a hopeless desire, however, until Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">again proved his resourcefulness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Searching through his pockets, which invariably con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained as miscellaneous an assortment of odds and ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the pockets of the proverbial small boy, he pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced a large wire nail. By means of stones and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting-knife, and at the expense of bruised fingers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he at last succeeded in bending this into hook-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. Unstringing his bow, he attached the crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">hook to the string, and having baited it with a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of frog's meat, he stretched himself full length on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank and dangled his improvised fishing-tackle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pool. The fish, which had never before seen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hook or a line and was therefore wholly unsuspicious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost no time. With a rush he seized the baited hook,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the next instant was flapping upon the grass at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet. Instantly I knew why my arrow had failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to injure him. He was a ganoid fish, one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange hold-overs from prehistoric days, which, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sturgeons and a few other species, wear a coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bony armor on the skin in place of scales. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen similar species in the rivers of Guiana, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I examined his gleaming coat of mail, his exterior</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeleton in fact, I no longer wondered that my arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been turned aside. But despite his peculiarities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he proved excellent eating, and we lunched sumptu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously that day. Having thus provided for our mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day meal, we again resumed our tramp. We had by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time become so accustomed to the magnified forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of insect life, that we gave little attention to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except now and then, when some new or most unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">459</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt sick with fear as visions of becoming the victim of the loathsome thing swept through my mind, and frantically</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I leaped aside, screaming as I did so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">creature attracted us. And, having so far been un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">molested, and having encountered nothing dangerous--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the exception of the hornet on the first day--</seg><seg type="columnLine">we became rather careless and thereby came very near</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting a most horrible end. We were crossing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small open space in the forest when a dark shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell across our path. Glancing quickly up, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrified to see a huge, fearsome-looking creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooping like a hawk upon us. At my first glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had mistaken it for another giant hornet. Its huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes had the same ferocious expression; it possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same broad, transparent, powerful wings; its ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended clawed feet were similar, and its deep-orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blue thorax, slender waist and tapering abdomen</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hornet-like. But the powerful, sharp-edged bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing jaws of the hornet were missing, and in place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dagger-like sting of the hornet, there was a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">horny appendage. As with a sharp startled yell I</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to one side, Tom following, I realized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of the malignant thing. It was a gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ichneumon-fly, an insect even more terrible and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsive in its habits than the predatory hornet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hornet may sting its victims into a coma and</seg><seg type="columnLine">place them within its nest to be devoured alive by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">young. But the Ichneumon reverses the process.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swooping upon some caterpillar or other insect, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">clings fast to the struggling creature and deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposits its eggs under the unfortunate victim's skin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In due time the eggs hatch, the young ichneumons</seg><seg type="columnLine">devour the tissues of the living body within which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">find themselves, and the doomed creature, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry maggots within him, continues to live, to eat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and to suffer untold agonies as the parasites gnaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his vitals until they have attained their full growth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, transforming to chrysalids, they leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrunken almost devoured creature to die a lingering</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, and eventually emerge from his carcass as full</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown ichneumons. All this flashed through my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I dodged the swooping creature and escaped it by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair's breadth. For a brief instant I had thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps the ichneumon was attacking us in error; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had mistaken us for larvaa or some other natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey and that, finding itself mistaken, it would draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and continue on its way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But hope died in my heart as, baffled, the ichneumon</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked its swift descent and with amazing speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and dashed at me. I felt sick with fear as</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions of becoming the victim of the loathsome awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing swept through my mind, and frantically I leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside, screaming as I did so. But for a man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodge a winged insect is a difficult and hopeless under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking as anyone who has ever disturbed a hornet's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nest or a bee-hive is aware. And to seek safety in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight was, I knew, suicidal. The ichneumon could</seg><seg type="columnLine">move ten feet to my one, and the instant I took to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heels it would be upon my unprotected back. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddered at thought of feeling those grasping claws</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my body, of feeling the sharp stabbing pain as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature's ovipositor penetrated my flesh and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posited an egg in my quivering tissues. All this, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, occurred in an instant. The enraged insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">was swooping at me again, and in a few moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">more would have fastened its claws upon me, had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been for Tom. He, poor fellow, was as terrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">460</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as myself, although he had no knowledge of the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture's habits and the awful fate in store for him if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ichneumon accomplished its purpose. As I dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dodged about and Tom came within the insect's range</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vision, the creature became confused and, suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoning its attack on me, it hurled itself at Tom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luckily for him, he reached the shelter of a tree in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nick of time, and the insect, unable to check its</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush or to turn in time, bumped against the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the tree trunk. For the fraction of a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">it clung there, apparently a bit dazed and stunned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But that fraction of a second was enough. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush, my presence of mind returned to me. Whipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">out my pistol, I sprang close to the momentarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiescent insect and fired two shots in rapid succes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion into its thorax. Acrid, ill-smelling juice oozed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bullet holes, the great wings quivered, the \</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooked claws slowly relaxed and, still alive but in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of flight or action, the terrible thing dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tho earth. And as with fiendish hate we beat it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a pulp with sticks and stones, I thanked Heaven</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had retained my pistol and my ammunition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO shaken and unnerved were we from this awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience, that we were quite unable to walk or</seg><seg type="columnLine">even stand, and for an hour or more we sat there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale, nervous and trembling. But the attack of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ichneumon had taught us a lesson. It had proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were surrounded by dangers at every step,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at any instant we were liable to be attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some unexpected quarter and by some unsus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected creature and that if we were to survive for long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must be constantly on the alert; the least careless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness might result in our deaths, or worse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hence, when we started forward once more, we pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded with the utmost caution and it was well that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">did. Suddenly, from the dense growth of canes at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the jungle, came the sounds of some immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature rushing towards us. The canes swayed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed, snapped and were crunched underfoot, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though a herd of elephants were approaching at break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck speed. Not knowing what terrible thing might</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear, what gigantic creature might be about to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack us, we rushed for shelter and cowered, trembling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a huge tree. The next instant the canes parted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing had prepared us for the thing that burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon our astounded eyes. It was a monster, a verit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able dragon, fully fifty feet in length, and the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">counterpart of the carvings I had seen at Tupec.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With incredible speed, it rushed from the canebrake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped across an immense fallen tree, raced through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest and vanished in the distance. Never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">I seen any living creature move with such agility and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidity on four feet. It appeared, sped past us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished, all in one flashing movement. But brief as</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been its appearance, I had obtained a fairly good</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the creature. Its scaly body that gleamed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal was vivid green from the tip of its big blunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">snout to the end of its immensely long tail. Its stout,</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful legs ended in long-toed feet, armed with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">recurved claws, a foot in length. Beneath its throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung a great fold of loose skin or a dewlap. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of its broad, scaly head rose a crown or crest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of serrated, upright plates of blue, and along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire length of its back and tail extended a row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">upstanding thin scales two feet or more in height.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despite its gigantic proportions and its dragon-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance, I knew that it was merely a super-lizard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the iguana group, and, unless varying vastly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits from all its fellow species, a most omnivorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast, ready to devour anything of vegetable or animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature that came its way, although it was by prefer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ance a vegetarian. Obviously it had not been after</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and had probably not seen us, but I trembled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of what would have happened had we been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way and had been trampled under the feet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying monster. I realized, also, how powerless we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be to protect ourselves from such a beast, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pistol and our arrows would prove as ineffective</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his scale protected hide as against an ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant. Tom of course was once more quaking with</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror and clung close to my side as we hurriedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the spot and moved directly away from the area</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherein the huge lizard had vanished. It was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that giant insects were by no means the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">denizens of the place which we had to fear and guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">against. If iguanas reached such giant proportions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no reason to believe that other reptiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not attain an equally great size. What, I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered, would a snake be like? What if we stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon some deadly serpent--upon a bush-master or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rattlesnake equally overgrown? Bush-masters in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropics attain a length of eight or nine feet--larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">by far than any ordinary iguana--and hence these</seg><seg type="columnLine">most deadly of snakes might be expected to be fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred feet in length if they existed here. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boa or anaconda! Eighteen to twenty-five feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length is not unusual for these under normal condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, and here they might easily grow to a length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred feet if developed in equal ratio to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">iguana and the batrachians. These were disconcert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thoughts, and the only comfort was that such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things might not exist and that, judging from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiences so far, they must be scarce if they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">exist. And, after all, I thought, a boa or anaconda</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred feet long or more would probably take</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more notice of a puny man six feet in height than</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ordinary boa of twenty feet would give to a hum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming bird or a squirrel. Moreover, all the big snakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">are very sluggish and such gigantic serpents as I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagining would not, in all probability, be capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rapid movement and could readily be avoided. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snakes, if they existed and were of immense propor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, would not be nearly as dangerous as the livelier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more active and voracious creatures, such as lizards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and especially the carnivorous Solopendras. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled. I had been disturbing myself, working my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self into a nervous state, by imagining utterly im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible perils. How could there be huge snakes when</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing for them to eat? All the mammals</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had seen were tiny things, not enough to supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">a meal for even an insignificant snake, and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not imagine a boa depending upon insects for its sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenance. So, dismissing all further thoughts of giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">serpents, I passed the time, as we tramped along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally reviewing more reasonable possibilities and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and again stopping to examine some particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting form of insect life. One thing struck me</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcibly, though it had not before attracted my at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention. There were no birds. Not a chirp, trill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor song of a bird had I heard since I had entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place. To be sure, amid such a chorus of insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">noises as came incessantly from tree-tops and under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush, it would be difficult to distinguish a bird's note.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in all our wanderings, we had not caught a glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a feathered creature. If birds were non-existent, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was small wonder that insects teemed, and I reasoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in all probability the absence of birds was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the principal reasons why- the insects had developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to such proportions. From an ornithological viewpoint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rather regretted the lack of bird life. What astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing things they would be if they occurred here. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">let my imagination run wild and tried to visualize</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliantly-hued warblers and tanagers as large as</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">461</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eagles; partridges as big as ostriches; hawks the equals</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sinbad's Rok, and humming-birds the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pheasants. But on the other hand, our own dangers</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been enormously increased. A hawk, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagle, even a crow or a crane would have been an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly customer, if built on the same proportionate</seg><seg type="columnLine">scale as the insects and reptiles, and I thanked our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky stars that birds of prey did not occur here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile, we had left the denser parts of the forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, and presently emerged at the edge of an open</seg><seg type="columnLine">space which, to my surprise, I recognized as the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereon was the home of the black savages. To be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, we had reached it by a different route from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one we had followed the first day. But it was unmis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takable, for in the distance was the mound with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of stones, and even from where we stood, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguish the moving figures of the beings. ^Nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hand was a smaller hill, and beyond this and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps a quarter of a mile from it, was a broad expanse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green which I recognized as the orchard or grove</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherein I had first seen the aphid-cattle. A few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments' study enabled me to locate the spot where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen the aphids driven into the underground pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages, and still anxious to learn more of this interest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing incident, I hurried across the plain with Tom at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE were just in time. As we neared the place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">several aphids came lumbering forth from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrances in the mound and, knowing our appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">would alarm them, I dropped behind a boulder with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom beside me. One after another the grotesque,</seg><seg type="columnLine">overgrown insects emerged, to be followed at last by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a black herder who, rounding up his charges, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced driving them in the direction of the grove.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Determined to reach the subterranean chambers before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the aphids came forth, I sprang up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried forward. Sounds from within assured me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupants were still there and, quite forgetting our</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger, I entered the nearest aperture. The place</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelt abominably. It was worse than any cow-shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">or stable, for mingled with the stench of dung and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sharp pungent odor of the blacks, was that sickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet smell I have mentioned as being so nauseating</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the burrows of the savages. Tom coughed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked, and I felt suffocated, but my scientific ardor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aroused and I hurried on. As I had conjectured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place was dark as pitch, but presently I saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimmer of light ahead, and turned into a side passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the direction of the light came the sounds I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard; low grumbling noises, the soft squashy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds of moving heavy feet, and a strange swishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise. The next moment we came to the entrance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large chamber faintly illuminated by a shaft from</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, and I halted dumbfounded. The place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided into two or three sections by mud walls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was crowded with the aphids. And, moving about</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them, were a dozen or more of the black sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages actually engaged in milking their insect-cows! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a well known fact that many species of our com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon ants not only make use of aphids as we use cows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even watch over and tend their plant-lice herds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in addition build underground stables or shelters</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which they keep the aphids during cold or inclement</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather. But to come suddenly upon such things, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpectedly find aphid-cattle in their subterranean</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelters, to actually enter these and see aphids as</seg><seg type="columnLine">large as real cows, and to watch these being milked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by human beings instead of by ants, was astonishing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the manner in which the blacks obtained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">milk--if milk it can be called--was most interesting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ants, I knew, stroke the aphids with their feet in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">order to induce them to exude the desired "honey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dew" as it is called, and it has always been assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and accepted as fact--by scientists, that the stroking</seg><seg type="columnLine">produces a pleasurable sensation upon the nerves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aphids and that this causes them to produce their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet excretion. But the savages before me were beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and lashing their charges with switches and sticks</seg><seg type="columnLine">in anything but a gentle or pleasurable manner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at each stroke, the aphids, grunting and protesting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but unable to move because they were securely teth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered fore and aft, were exuding the thick, greenish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow fluid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obviously it was pain rather than pleasure which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caused the aphids to give up their secretion, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was instantly convinced that it was the irritation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ants' claws and no pleasurable stroking that caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">our ordinary aphids to produce honey-dew for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants' delectation. Surprising and interesting as was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this discovery, even more amazing was the manner in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the blacks were gathering the "honey-dew."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beside each aphid under treatment, there squatted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous black, and as the viscid material dripped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appendages of the aphid above him he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch the fluid in his great toothless mouth. When at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last his mouth could hold no more he would close his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips, scurry to a large trough-like affair of clay and</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty the contents of his mouth into it. Each black</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, in fact, a living milk-pail, and as Tom watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the process and it dawned upon him that it was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance which he had swallowed on the first night</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the savages,--and that it had unquestionably</seg><seg type="columnLine">been prepared in the same manner, he uttered a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gusted and far from elegant exclamation. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of his voice, the occupants of the cow-pen be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came panic-stricken. Catching sight of us, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped their sticks and switches and huddled among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cattle, while those who had been catching the milk</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly emptied their mouths by the simple expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dient of swallowing the contents, and scurried like</seg><seg type="columnLine">rats between the legs of their aphids, who, also alarmed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">milled and struggled and snorted, crushing their mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters and trampling upon them. Whether the unfortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nate savages were badly injured or killed or not, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the disturbance was finally quelled and affairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened out, I cannot say. Regretting that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the cause of all the trouble, and having seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, I hurried from the place. How or where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost our way I cannot say. But it was soon evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">to both Tom and me that we were not moving towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening whence we had entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In vain we attempted to retrace our steps. Over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over again we stopped and listened, hoping to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the sounds that would lead us back to the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had just left. And over and over again, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we heard the sounds and at last reached the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">whence they emanated, we discovered it was a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber. Presently, in the dim light ahead, we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the form of a scurrying savage, and feeling sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually he would enter some passage whence we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reach the outer air, we dashed after him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next moment he vanished, and coming to an abrupt</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt, we found ourselves at the entrance of a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, the contents of which caused me to rub my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and stare incredulously. Everywhere over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor swarmed immature savages. I cannot call them</seg><seg type="columnLine">babies or infants, for they were such unspeakably hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribly repulsive and hideous things that they deserve</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to be called lame. They were a sickly livid-gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">in color, almost shapeless, with stubby pulpy limbs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces which seemed all mouth and eyes. Apparently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, they were all of approximately the same age,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when we first saw them they were in charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">462</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">several undersized blacks, who I surmised, were females,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but who seemed to scent our presence and almost in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly vanished. I had no mind to enter the stink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing place nor to make a closer inspection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">infantile stages of the beings. But the next chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw was, if anything, worse. Here again were</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless of the young, but these were much larger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were more active, and the manner in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrid things crawled, squirmed and wallowed in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own filth and over one another was disgustingly like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mass of maggots. Another and another chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">was passed, each containing its quota of young, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each lot being apparently older and more advanced than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preceding. Everywhere, too, the sweetish, fetid</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor of the aphids' milk was overpowering, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed in my hurried glances into the nurseries, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young savages were being fed on this substance!;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even in my disgust and hurry to get away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place I could not help wondering what became of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an innumerable supply of young savages. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt the percentage of infantile fatalities was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">high, but even if a tenth of the young reached adult</seg><seg type="columnLine">size the whole country would, I thought, be overrun</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the savages in a few years. And yet there did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not appear to be a great number of the blacks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were restricted to the vicinity of their homes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently, all young were reared in unison and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all identity to parentage was lost. Indeed, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable, I thought, that even the mothers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant of the parentage of their offspring, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not imagine such degenerate creatures having</seg><seg type="columnLine">either morals or marriages of any sort. They were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact, scarcely a step above the brutes, scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the insects; and once more their amazingly ant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like characters and habits struck me forcibly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">way they herded the aphids, the extensive use of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honey-dew, the manner in which the young were cared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for; even the appearance of the grub-like young, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">all more ant-like than human. Was it possible, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered, that they had developed such habits and</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters through watching ants? But all conjectures</seg><seg type="columnLine">and speculations were forgotten, when, a moment later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw bright light ahead and emerged from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage into the open air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FROM the summit of the mound which marked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance to the savages' homes, we had a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good view of the surrounding country. I had not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, noticed this before, for we had left the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it was fairly daylight, and the mountains and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests had been shrouded in mist. But now we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see across the wide areas of jungle and forest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">across plains, valleys and hills, and had an unob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed view of a large portion of the surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains. Now I understood a matter which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled me. I had often wondered how the savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">had first happened to see us. Not since that first</seg><seg type="columnLine">day had I seen any of the blacks in the jungle or</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest, and yet the Indians had been attacked and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been captured several miles from the area to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the savages appeared to confine their activities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I could readily see that from their mound they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spied us as we entered the place and had deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately gone after us. To me, however, the terrain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranges was of far greater interest and importance</seg><seg type="columnLine">than anything else, and I studied them carefully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching for a spot which might offer a pass or</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening. They were mostly rugged, sheer cliffs, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">questionably of volcanic structure, and hence, I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">liable to be much broken and cut with fissures, canyons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ravines. Moreover, they did not appear to be as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">high as I had first estimated them. Assuming that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lowest limit of perpetual snow was approximately</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen thousand feet above the sea, I judged from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extent of gleaming ice that crowned the summits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the highest peaks were not over twenty or twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thousand feet above the surface of this place. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as no such lofty mountains had ever been reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the surrounding country--the highest known</seg><seg type="columnLine">being the Pakina range, not exceeding fourteen thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand feet above the continental surface, as any such</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaks would be visible for hundreds of miles, I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that the surface of the land in this strange terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory must be about six thousand feet below the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the country beyond the mountains. But unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could discover a pass, it mattered little to us whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains were twenty or fifty thousand feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">height. To scale a range twenty thousand feet high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with several thousand feet of their summits en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely covered with glaciers and frozen snow, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a temperature below zero, was I knew, an impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat. But some ten or twelve miles beyond where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, almost in a direct line with a distinctive three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaked mountain, I could distinguish a deep purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow which might indicate a canon. It seemed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most promising spot to explore, and so, leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages' mound, we turned our steps towards the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains. Fortunately, as it seemed at the time, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">route led along the edge of the cleared land where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">bordered on the forest. Here it was far easier walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing than in the forest or jungle; there was less dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger of being surprised by dangerous creatures, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was less damp and oppressive for the sun had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sipated the miasmic mists and vapors here in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOON, too, we reached the aphid orchard and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">it delightfully cool in the shade of the orderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged, broad-topped bushes. From twelve to sixteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet or more above our heads the branches were inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laced to form an almost continuous roof of vegetation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while underfoot the earth had been packed down until</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm and smooth by countless herds of aphids pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over it. Several times we saw black herders</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozing in the shade while their cattle grazed con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentedly in the branches above them. Some were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound asleep and were quite unaware of our proximity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while others, who were awake, hurriedly sought refuge</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bush-tops as soon as they saw us approaching.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glancing up at these, I noticed in several places that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rude structures of interlaced twigs and leaves had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been constructed where large limbs forked from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main stems. At first I thought them arboreal homes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the savages, but presently I realized that their true</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose was to serve as shelters for the aphids in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of sudden showers. Here again the savages ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibited most amazingly ant-like habits, for I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite familiar with the aphid-sheds or shelters erected</seg><seg type="columnLine">by many of our commonest ants and in which their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny plant-lice cattle are protected from the weather.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ofie discovery often leads to another, and as I moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, the better to observe the sheds, I noticed sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral odd creatures among the aphids. They were most</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque and weird-looking things. They were slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger than the aphids but were far less clumsy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulky, with slenderer bodies, longer, thinner legs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter, more intelligent eyes. In fact, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered down at us, their expression was so droll and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quizzical, that both Tom and myself laughed gaily at</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Their, forms and colors were, however, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">most astonishing features. All appeared monstrosities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some were humpbacked, others were broad and flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened, some had projecting rhinoceros-like horns on</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">463</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their heads, and several were armed with wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading horns that would have been a credit to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Texas steer. Some were brown, some green, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">mottled with yellow and black, and a number were</seg><seg type="columnLine">most gaily marked with diagonal stripes of intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and vivid green. Although I should have recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized them at a glance, yet they were so huge, so exag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerated in all their details, that it was not until one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them leaped abruptly from its perch, and sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the air for fully fifty feet before it alighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on another limb, that it dawned upon me that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Ieaf-hoppers, hemiptera closely related to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aphids. But in their appearance, their actions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their agility, they no more resembled the heavy, slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving, bovine aphids, than a deer resembles a cow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even as I watched them, interesting events were trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piring over my head. Scarcely had the giant' leaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopper made his astonishing jump through space when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a black savage materialized from somewhere among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaves, and grimacing down at us, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly out of patience at our presence, he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambling and swinging from branch to branch in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of the grotesque creature. Every moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">I expected to see the leaf-hopper leap again as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black approached him, for I well knew how wary</seg><seg type="columnLine">these insects are and how exasperating it is to attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to capture one of our ordinary species.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was therefore greatly surprised to see the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow and reach the side of the creature, straddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">its hard back, and deliver resounding blows with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short club upon its savage-looking horns. For a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment the leaf-hopper shook its head menacingly, backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the stem to which it clung and squatted down</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if determined to remain there indefinitely. But as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blows still continued to fall it thought better of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter, gathered itself together, and before our</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounded eyes it leaped back towards the bush whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had come. Thereupon the savage dismounted, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired to the shelter of his leafy retreat, and the leaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopper, burying its proboscis in the soft bark, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed its interrupted feeding. Here, then, was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">another ant trick. The blacks had domesticated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaf-hoppers as well as the aphids for the sake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their "honey-dew." Truly indeed they must literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">have followed the time-honored advice of "Go to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant thou sluggard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To me, accustomed as I was to the marvelous habits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of insects and the wonders of their every-day lives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insects of this place had been a revelation, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was being continually amazed at observations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">discoveries I made. But to Tom, who never before</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dreamed that such things existed, the most ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary habits of the insects, thus revealed by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense size, appeared to savor of the miraculous or</seg><seg type="columnLine">supernatural. But even I could appreciate his feelings</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, having watched the leaf-hopper's amazing jump</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its savage black rider, he stood gazing, open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed and with sagging jaw. And I thoroughly agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him when, as we resumed our way, he shookl</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head dubiously and remarked: "Ah ain' never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seed nawthin' in no circus tha' equal, Chief. Lordy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that mos' surely was travelin'l"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then as a sudden idea came to his somewhat .child-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish mind, he halted in his tracks, and exclaimed, "Fo'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tha' Lo'd, Chief, Don't it been possible we kin cotch</seg><seg type="columnLine">some o' them beas's an' ride 'em our own sel's? Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir, Chief, they'd mos' cert'nly move we over this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place mos' exped'ently. An' can they keep on a-leapin''</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that fo' long they'd ca'y us clean 'crost that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountings in scarce no time 'tall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hmm," I muttered, wondering if, after all, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be anything in Tom's wild idea. "I don't be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve we could catch them in the first place, Tom. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">might steal one or two from those black rascals, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much doubt if we could control them, guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">them or manage to do anything with them. They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to their black savage owners and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be frightened and wild if we went near them. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know as I am very anxious to attempt to ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">one on such a jump. It would be worse than riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bucking broncho."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom sighed a bit regretfully. "Yaas, Chief," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted, as he moved on again. "Ah, 'spec' you' right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah calc'late as how they's like the Coolie buff'loes we has</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Jamaica. They mos' humbuggin' ugly beas's an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't Stan' no foolishness from white men or niggers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they gentle like kitten wif tha Coolies an' any little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coolies boy or girl can ride he an' driv he about any</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Yaas, Chief, an' Ah took notice some o' them</seg><seg type="columnLine">beas's been mos' surely like them Buff'loes in aspec's.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They got tha same ho'ns an' tha same hump on he</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. But Wa-la! T'ank de good Lord the buff'loes</seg><seg type="columnLine">caint go a-leapin' 'bout like dem folks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE reached our objective point without further adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture and without encountering anything of particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar note. I was elated to find that as I had suspected, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a deep ravine or canyon cutting into the mountain at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this point and promising a pass. But we were doomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to disappointment. After long hours of laboriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing over loose rocks, toiling up the cliffs and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways ascending, we came to the end of the canon, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cid-de-sac with precipitous walls impossible to scale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our efforts, however, had not been without some re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults. In one spot, a few hundred feet above the val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley and just beyond the limits of the vegetation, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found a deep fissure or cave near the base of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff. This I had at once realized would provide an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideal dwelling and, finding we would be forced to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main in the country for a time at least, we decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take possession of the cave. It was large and dry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a chimney or volcanic blow-hole extended from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof of the cave to the open air far above, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">providing ventilation and sufficient light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nearby a brook trickled down the mountain side, fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the melting snows far above, and within easy dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance was the jungle. The question of food did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry us, for since we had discovered that the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">land-frogs were palatable we could always be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a meal by hunting up one of the creatures, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short search would always result in the discovery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hare-like animals which were easily killed by ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows or even stones. A little later, too, Tom rigged up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coop-trap in which he captured many of these crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As there were practically no insects on the bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain side, the only species we had seen being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few butterflies and some harmless beetles, we felt we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rest undisturbed in our cave during the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there was always the danger of being attacked by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some roving lizard or other beast, or by some predatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">hornet or ichneumon, and our first step was to protect</seg><seg type="columnLine">our new home from invasion. This we accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">by constructing a door of light poles bound together</seg><seg type="columnLine">to form a grid-like affair.- It was not a difficult job,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the entrance to the cavern was not over six feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in width by eight feet in height. To be sure, any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly large beast could have torn the frail screen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits or could have pushed it aside, but I trusted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instinctive fear of traps which seems to be com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon to all wild animals, and I had little dread of any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing attempting to reach us past the screen. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no place in which to sling our hammocks, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we felt sure we would be free from insect invaders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">464</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and as the floor of the cave was dry, we gathered dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves and dry moss and soon had comfortable beds</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared. Partly for the sake of warmth, for the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was chilly and cold at night, and partly to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">being overwhelmed by insects attracted by the light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we built our fire within the cave. It was well that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we did so, for no sooner had darkness fallen than hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of insects came buzzing, whirring about. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">very few were small enough to find entrance through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the openings in our door, and they bumped and banged</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves aimlessly against the screen while we re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained cozy and comfortable within. And as we at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last threw ourselves upon our couches and I smoked</seg><seg type="columnLine">an after-dinner pipe, I felt more at ease and far safer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than at any time since we had reached the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">country.	v</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the cave's altitude we were able to look down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a vast area of the land, which lay spread like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">map below us. Without difficulty, we located the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mound whence we had emerged from the tunnel from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tupec. We could see the open area with the semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular wall of the black savages' home in its centre.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The orderly rows of bushes where the aphids pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured appeared like a neatly laid out garden; and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could even identify the area that we had covered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our wanderings. And a very small, an almost negligi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble portion of the whole place this was. In fact, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared the limited district we knew with the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast expanse of plains, forests, jungles, hills, valleys</seg><seg type="columnLine">and marshes, it seemed a hopeless, endless task to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explore the whole or even a small part of it. This,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, did not trouble me, for I had no interest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place aside from a possible way of escape, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no intention of exploring the land, more than was</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary, as we would move from one spot to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other in our search for an exit. But as I studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">topography, and as the light increased and the drift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing vapors and fogs were dissipated, I began to notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">many features of the land which interested me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not far from the base of our mountain, and a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the east, was a broad expanse of green which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rather unnatural appearance. In fact, the edges</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so straight and even and the low vegetation ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to grow in such oddly rectangular areas, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt convinced that they were cultivated fields. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly, I thought, they were fields of the blacks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps additional pastures for the aphids herds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farther off, and covering an area of several hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred acres as I judged, was an almost bare spot dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a few large trees and, as I gazed at this, I started</seg><seg type="columnLine">and uttered an ejaculation of surprise, for unless my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes woefully deceived me, I could distinguish a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of buildings clustered there. And when Tom also</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the structures, I knew that there was no fault</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my vision and that human beings, perhaps semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized men must dwell there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the next instant my hopes fell, for close nearby</seg><seg type="columnLine">I noted a second orchard of the aphids' shrubs. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt it was merely a larger settlement of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages, and I sighed regretfully as I turned my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards another quarter. But Tom, whose eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">far sharper than mine, was making discoveries on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own account. Urging me to look in the direction he</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated, he pointed towards the cultivated fields and</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted, that he could see men moving about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">working. For a long time I stared, longing for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">field-glass to aid my vision, until at last I, too, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the movement of tiny figures. But so distant were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they, so foreshortened as we gazed down from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, and so concealed among the vegetation, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not distinguish any details. Tom insisted, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, that they were not blacks, such as we had met;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were brown or reddish, like Indians, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were cultivating the fields. Presently, too, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made out a road or pathway leading from the fields,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wildly excited, he cried out that he could see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">village at the end of the roadway. Once he had pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out I, also, could see it, and this time, I felt con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that the little settlement was not the home of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blacks. Instead of the circular wall of stones and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minute black dots marking the openings to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground burrows, I could see fences or walls built in</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight lines and forming a large irregular square en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing a number of buildings apparently of thatch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by plots of green, like small gardens. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there a spreading tree or a palm rose above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edifices and, in every respect, the place had the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of an Indian village. Instantly I determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to investigate. If there were Indians, the chances were</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would be peaceful. On all my expeditions I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never yet met a hostile Indian, except where they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered at the hands of whites or blacks, and here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I well knew no other civilized man had pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated, I felt confident the Indians would prove friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. Still there was a chance that, never having seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white man before, they might become terror-stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">and attack me before waiting for explanations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, however, was a rather remote chance; more-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it was a chance that must be taken. Not that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so overwhelmingly anxious to partake of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aborigines' hospitality; nor was I obsessed with ethno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical ardor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom and myself were living quite comfortably and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we did not particularly feel the need of the compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ionship of other men. But the Indians--or whoever</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might prove to be--would know the country and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if they could not lead us to some exit from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, they would prove of the utmost value as guides</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in aiding us in innumerable ways during such</seg><seg type="columnLine">time as we were searching for a means of escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, they possessed cultivated land and, doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, vegetables, fruits and grain, and we would I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, soon be sorely in need of a change of diet if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were to preserve our strength and health. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gave little thought to it at that time, I remember now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I wondered how on earth the Indians could culti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vate the land and raise crops where insects were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous and of such size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somewhat to my surprise, Tom appeared as ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">and willing to make our way to the distant village</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I was. I had expected him to be nervous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened but he had become so accustomed to visit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wild and savage tribes with me in the past, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had faced so many far more terrifying things here</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this land, that the idea of visiting human beings--</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter who or what they might be--appealed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as about the only normal thing we could do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAVING breakfasted well, and having prepared an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample supply of food--for we had, I knew, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and weary tramp ahead of us, we rather regret-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully left our snug cave and, after fixing the location</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the village in my mind and noting landmarks, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">started on our way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first few miles was down hill and easy going,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from our point of vantage on the mountain side I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had picked out a route which appeared to be less diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult than striking blindly through the forest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungles. In a general way it followed the courses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streams and, as I had foreseen, we were enabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to proceed far more rapidly than on our former tramps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very soon, too, the country took on quite a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and different character. The jungle became more open</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fewer of the giant fungi and with more of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">465</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">palms and tree-ferns. The flat land gave way to roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hills, and presently, although I had not been aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it when looking down from above, I realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were steadily ascending. From our cave, the culti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vated lands had appeared only a few miles distant--</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly not over ten miles. But as we tramped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on, toiling up the hills and maintaining our course</seg><seg type="columnLine">by occasional glimpses of the mountains, I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize how deceptive distances might be, when viewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a considerable altitude. By mid-day we had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the elevation and found ourselves on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, fairly level plateau, rising well above the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding forests and jungles, and covered with brushy</seg><seg type="columnLine">areas and open park-like groves of big trees. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cursory examination convinced me that the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, at some time, been under cultivation. v</seg><seg type="columnLine">The decayed remains of trees and bushes that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cut down were still visible. There were large</seg><seg type="columnLine">piles of stones which had obviously been picked out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth as it was ploughed or turned over. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were fragments of low mud walls, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">several places, among the weeds and brush, were stray</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalks of a corn-like plant quite new to me, as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a large grass bearing heads of grains, somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">like wheat. That any Indians should have cultivated</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an extensive territory and should have done so</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such an apparently thorough manner, was astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The ordinary jungle Indian usually cultivates very</seg><seg type="columnLine">small fields in the forests and, as soon as the soil loses</seg><seg type="columnLine">its fertility, he moves his gardens to a new spot at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a considerable distance. But I was aware that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quichuas, Aimaras and other Andean tribes were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent agriculturalists. Moreover, in this land, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">mammalian and bird life was almost lacking, man</seg><seg type="columnLine">would of necessity fall back on agriculture unless, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blacks, he copied the habits of the ants and domesti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated giant insects. There was another peculiarity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place which caused me considerable surprise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I could not understand. Insects were scarce</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, come to think of it, I could not recollect having</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen any huge forms of insect life--with the excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of several flashing dragon-flies, one or two beetles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose stench identified them as carybidae, whose prey</seg><seg type="columnLine">was caterpillars, and sailing high in air some insects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I took to be flies or bees. I had not seen a but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terfly, a moth, a larva, or even a ground-beetle. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had little time to puzzle over these matters. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached the edge of the deserted, brush-grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields and before us saw a low mud wall and beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">it fields of waving grain. Not desirous of taking any</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances, we crouched back of the wall, peered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grainfields searching for Indians, and endeavored to</seg><seg type="columnLine">orient ourselves and recall where the village was sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uated. This was not difficult. From our hiding place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could look back and see the big scarf in the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain side which I had hoped was a pass and, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite direction, I could pick out a peculiarly formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">peak which I had noted as a bearing. According to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my calculations, the village lay a few hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond us and to the left. But I could hear no sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life, no barking of dogs, no human voices, such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually emanate from an Indian village. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid-day and the chances were that the inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were lazing away the hottest portion of the day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking their siestas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a good time to visit them, and I was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rise and proceed in the direction of the village,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when my attention was attracted to the luscious look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ears of corn so near us. The sight of this re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded me that I was hungry and, anxious to test</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edible qualities of the new cereal, I leaped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall and started towards the nearest stalks. The next</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">instant there was a loud humming from overhead, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp cry of warning from Tom, and I glanced up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to see a huge winged creature dropping like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling meteor towards me. Without stopping to ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion what manner of enemy it was. but almost sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciously supposing it a bird of prey, I dodged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelter of the corn stalks. I was not an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">too soon. As I crashed into the thick growth of ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot stalks, the creature struck the spot where I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood an instant before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as, momentarily, it alighted upon the earth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had a good view of it, I was utterly dumbfounded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was no rapacious bird, but a gigantic bee, a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuzzy black and buff insect with a body the size of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beer keg and with dusky semi-transparent wings fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">five feet across. There was no question that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry and that it had deliberately attempted to attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Its eyes gleamed savagely, its strong mandibles</seg><seg type="columnLine">clashed together like the action of some carnivorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast gnashing its teeth; its antennae were laid back</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the ears of a fractious mule, and its big abdomen^</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and fell, constantly unsheathing and withdrawing a'</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrifying stiletto-like sting. And it was buzzing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roar of a steam saw-mill as it peered in my direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, as if considering whether or not to attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">resume its attack. There was no doubt that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the solitary bees related to our common bumu\e-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bees and, I reasoned, in all probability its nest was</seg><seg type="columnLine">close at hand and its fiery temper had been aroused</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it had spied me so close to its home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANYONE at all familiar with bumble-bees, or any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who has ever purposely or inadvertently dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed the nest of one of these insects, knows from</seg><seg type="columnLine">dire experience what short and ugly tempers the own-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers possess, and how unpleasant they can make it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trespasser. And here was a thoroughly aroused</seg><seg type="columnLine">and irate bumble-bee, several hundred times the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our common garden variety, ready and waiting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflict dire retribution on the being who had unwit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingly approached too closely to its home. I was in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty fix. I could not rise and seek safety in flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was not at all sure that the giant bee would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not advance upon me at any moment. Bees are most</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent creatures, and if this big fellow's brains</seg><seg type="columnLine">were developed in proportion to the rest of his body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must possess true reasoning powers. In that case</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would realize that all he had to do was to crawl</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the canes beneath which I cowered, thrust his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen-inch sting between the stalks and kill me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily as a man spears an eel. All this, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through my mind in a fraction of a second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, before the bee could make up its mind as to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">next move, before I could even wriggle deeper into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corn, there was a sharp twang from the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall and a five-foot arrow sang through the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buried itself in the bee's body. Tom had come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my rescue. With rare presence of mind he had used</seg><seg type="columnLine">his weapons to good effect and, too late, I bethought</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself of my revolver. The arrow had struck the bee</seg><seg type="columnLine">just back of the thorax, and with an angry buzz that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more like a roar, it swung itself about, twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a half-circle and with a single bite of its power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful jaws, snapped the arrow-_shaft in twain. Furiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">it beat its wings, striving to rise, but the muscle or</seg><seg type="columnLine">some nerve was severed and the poor creature rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and over. Its struggles became weaker and weaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the poison on the arrow did its work, until at last it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay dead and harmless before me. Not until then did</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rise, and hurrying to Tom, grasped his hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanked him fervently for his timely action and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plimented him on his marksmanship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">466</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My •words were cut short by a distant roar from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. The next instant we were racing as fast as</seg><seg type="columnLine">our legs could carry us in the direction of the village.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One brief glance had been enough. Fully a dozen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant bees were speeding towards their stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow, and we had no desire to be in the vicinity</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they arrived. Onward we dashed, keeping to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scant cover and dodging among the scattered trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while behind us the roar of buzzing wings grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">louder. Indians, no matter how savage and how wild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be preferable to the angry insects, and intent</seg><seg type="columnLine">only on reaching the village, we sped on. Suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of us, loomed a wall; beyond it were the roofs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of buildings. To scale the barricade in our spent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathless state was impossible and, even in my terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bees, I realized that should we appear suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the wall we would probably be shot down instantly!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somew'here there must be a gate or an opening, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting, stumbling, we dashed along the mud wall. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed endless; my legs felt as if they would collapse</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath me, but the increasing buzz of the bees spurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">me on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The next instant we turned an angle in the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before us was a low arched opening, and with a final</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurt we bent our heads, and dashed through it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS I stumbled through the gateway, amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">and terror drove all fears of the pursuing bees</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my mind.

McCook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a large circular area of hard-packed earth within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen yards of where I stood. Covering it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">piles of freshly-cut grain, and staring at us, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been interrupted in their work of threshing</seg><seg type="columnLine">by our precipitate arrival, were the inhabitants of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. I had expected to see Indians. Naked primitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages perhaps, but still men and women. Instead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beings I saw were monsters. So astounded, so ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rified was I, that, for the moment, I was not sure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whether or not they were human. Their color was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coppery-red; their great round heads were supported</seg><seg type="columnLine">on necks so slender that it seemed impossible that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could support them. They had enormous chests, at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenuated waists and short paunchy abdomens, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each had six, strong, powerful limbs. They were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects! Seven foot giants, thoroughly human in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitudes, their occupation and in their surroundings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but unquestionably insects nevertheless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As my stunned senses realized this, and, shuddering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I recoiled, I recognized them as monstrous ants. Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the creatures could have torn us to pieces with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease; but despite their awesome aspect, their powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful jaws, their unwinking staring eyes, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something reassuring about their appearance, an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangible, indescribable expression of intelligence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peacefulness on their faces. In fact they appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be as astounded at our wholly unexpected advent as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was about to dash pell mell into their midst. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">did they appear alarmed nor angry, and they made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostile move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this I noted almost instantaneously. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant the roar of the buzzing bees galvanized us into</seg><seg type="columnLine">life and action and with yells of terror, we dove for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelter of an open shed. Glancing over my shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drawing my pistol as I ran, I witnessed a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible and amazing thing--a sight that caused me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to halt in my tracks and to forget fear, giant ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything. As the first of the maddened bees swooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with extended sting ready to deal me a death</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow, one of the red creatures on the threshing floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted forward and threw itself directly in the bee's</seg><seg type="columnLine">path. I expected to see the creatures instantly at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked and destroyed. Instead, the bee checked itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mid-flight, swerved sharply to one side, and circling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to rest at the creature's feet. One after another</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other bees did the same until a swarm of the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects surrounded the man-like ant, humming in</seg><seg type="columnLine">subdued tones, fawning upon him. Stepping among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, he stroked their heads and backs, uttered strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely audible whistling sounds and appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversing with them. The next moment one bee</seg><seg type="columnLine">after another spread its wings and took .flight, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently all were again sailing, like tiny black specks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">high in the sky. Nothing I had hitherto witnessed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this marvelous land approached this for sheer incom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehensible wonder. Dazed as I was by my fright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my surprise and my topsy-turvey brain, yet I rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soned that the bees were domestic creatures, the prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erty of the beings before me, and that the red giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">had called off the chase and had saved my life. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this knowledge, like a flash of light came an even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more astounding thought. The bees were actually en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged in watching the ants' property, in guarding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grain fields, and had attacked us, not because we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">near their nests, but because we had trespassed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their domains. But wonders had only just begun. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge red ant was approaching Tom and me. He came</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, cautiously, as if striving not to alarm us. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments he would halt, rise on his hind legs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave his fore feet and antennae in a strange manner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wduld utter the same whistling or hissing sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had employed with the bees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom, of course, was nearly insane with terror and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt shaky and far from easy myself. But the fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shown friendliness rather than hostility by calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the bees, and I reasoned that, if he or his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions desired to attack or seize us, they could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done so readily, either singly or en-masse. In many</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, his actions were strikingly similar to those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange Indians when meeting a civilized man for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time; the actions of a man trying to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">467</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">friends but still a bit suspicious. And why should I</seg><seg type="columnLine">assume that these giant ants must be hostile or dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous? Why should I fear them any more than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have feared the unknown savages I had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to meet? So, summoning all the nerve I</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed, and comforting myself with the thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was at the ants' mercy anyway, I stepped forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving my own arms in much the same manner as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant. For an instant it hesitated, as if rather doubtful</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my peaceful intentions. Then, evidently reassured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stepped close to me, extended his antennae and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his great, horny, hook-clawed feet resting lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">against me, he examined me thoroughly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I confess I trembled, felt chill and in deadly fear as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his immense round head moved close to my own and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had a close-up view of the terrible mandibles which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have severed my neck as neatly as a guillotine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But his gentleness and the purring sounds he uttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave me courage, and I managed to stand the ordeal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bad as it was, it was not as terrible as the examina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion I had undergone at the hands of the black sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages. At last, apparently satisfied, he stroked me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his antennae and turned towards Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SHRIEK that would have roused the dead, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">there been any near, rose from Tom's lips, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowering and shaking, he clung to my coat. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, the ant regarded him critically standing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his four rear legs, his body raised and his head turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">first to one side and then the other, as he actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">"sniffed" with his antennae. Then, perhaps deciding</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom was of the same species as myself, or perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognizing him as my servant, he turned to me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-led, half-urged me towards the watching throng</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the threshing floor. For a moment I feared that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be forced to pass an examination by each ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">in turn. But luckily I was spared this, and while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the individual who had made the first advances ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained matters to his fellows, the others kept turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious glances at us. But as I stood there, the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tre of interest, I could not help thinking how puny I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed by comparison with the ants and how superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were to man in many ways. I am speaking only</seg><seg type="columnLine">of physical superiority, but since then I have become</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced that these ant-men, as I must call them, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as others, are man's superiors in mentality also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our advent might have been expected to completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">disorganize the ants for the time being. The arrival</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an inhabitant of Mars or Venus on earth would</seg><seg type="columnLine">most assuredly disorganize human occupations, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were unquestionably as strange and remarkable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ant-men as a Martian would be to ordinary humans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But nothing of the sort occurred. No sooner had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow explained matters--and I would give a lot to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what his explanation was--than they again re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed their work of threshing the wheat and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">no further heed to us. Whether or not the one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had checked the bees' attack and had introduced us, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say, was a leader, an officer or an official, I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">say. But he seemed to take charge of us by common</seg><seg type="columnLine">consent, and with gestures which were unmistakable</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their meaning, indicated that we were to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. For a moment I thought we were to be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducted to underground chambers and that possibly we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would once more find ourselves inquilines. But in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead, our guide led the way to one of the buildings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I noticed, now that I had recovered my self posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, that these were built of pellets of mud neatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled and cemented together and that the straw roofs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not true thatch but were in reality roofs of clay</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported and held together by straws. In form they</seg><seg type="columnLine">varied greatly. Some were roughly rectangular, others</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">circular, others oval; but all were alike in having dome-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped roofs. Near them, as I have mentioned, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">plots of vegetation, and as we passed some of these, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that they were seed-beds or nurseries and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with young plants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this discovery came a rather dim recollection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of having somewhere or at sometime seen similar beds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then suddenly, it dawned upon me. Why had I not</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of it before? It had been in southern Texas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I had been on an entomological trip, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent hours watching the marvelous habits of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famed Agricultural Ants. I had watched them busily</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing their tiny fields, pulling up the weeds, cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting down small sprouts. I had seen them garnering</seg><seg type="columnLine">their crops of grass seeds. I had seen the minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">grains threshed out by the insects, and had--quite ruth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly but in the name of science--dug up one of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground storehouses or granaries. There could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt about it. The ant-men among whom I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself were agricultural ants, very similar in habits</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their little Texas cousins, but far more advanced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">far more intelligent, and--as might be expected in a'</seg><seg type="columnLine">different environment -- possessing certain distinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits and characters. Evidently, too, they were, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">most agricultural creatures, including human beings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace-loving and friendly, and I felt sure that neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom nor myself had anything to fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By now we had reached the first building and, glanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing within as we passed it, I saw that it was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than half filled with ears of the corn-like cereal. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next was partly filled with the wheat-like grains the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants were threshing out, and as we passed the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of the fellows arrived carrying receptacles full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheat, and entering the building, dumped the contents</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a huge bin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was proof that the agricultural ant-men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">far ahead of their Texan prototypes in intelligence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had erected out-of-door storerooms; they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to build roofs; they had constructed bins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud walls; they had discovered how to form basket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like receptacles. With my interest and my scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirst for knowledge thoroughly aroused, and anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to study these most remarkable creatures, I felt actu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally grateful for quite by accident finding myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had now come to a smaller, round building and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this our guide entered. Then, having hissed or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistled again, and having rubbed me with his anten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nae, he left us and hurried off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room was bare of any furnishings of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it contained no food; in fact nothing except a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the basket-like utensils I had seen in use. Rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious to discover what type of weave the ants had</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed, I stepped forward and examined these. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">my surprise I found them formed of strong broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves firmly glued or cemented into shape. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled to know how this was accomplished or what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creatures used for their glue, but I was soon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have this puzzle solved. I also noticed that one wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the building was provided with numbers of arched</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings or holes reminding me of a country post-</seg><seg type="columnLine">office with gigantic mail-boxes. Wondering what pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose these served, I stepped close to them and peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the ones at the height of my eyes above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. Some were empty, except for soft shredded</seg><seg type="columnLine">straw scattered over the lower portion or floor, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my amazement, several were occupied by ants ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently sleeping. Could it be, I wondered, that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was actually a dormitory or barracks. It certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked that way, and perhaps we, too, were supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make ourselves as comfortable as possible in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">niches. They were certainly large enough to accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">468</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">modate us, being about three feet in width and height</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fully nine feet in depth. But they were stuffy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismal places and were far too much like the tombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a Latin American cemetery to appeal to me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I soon made another discovery. Noticing what</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be a rear door to the building I passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it and found myself in a long, gently-sloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor leading into a hill or mound, and with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, as far as I could see, riddled with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">oven-shaped apertures. Unquestionably these were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living quarters of the ants. From the main corridor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, side galleries led to right and left and these also</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained hundreds of the niches. Examining some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these, I found those of one corridor completely filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the dormant pupae of the ants. Another wtas</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted to the larva, and later, I found that the eggs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also stored in these pigeon-holes. I noticed, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the air in the corridors devoted to pupae, larva?</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eggs seemed much warmer than elsewhere and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently I found that the passages actually were</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmed by artificial means. In mud-walled receptacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed for the purpose, were piles of some material</seg><seg type="columnLine">which gave off considerable heat and a rather fragrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor or steam. It appeared to be decaying vegetable</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, although there was none of the unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor of rotting material, and ultimately I found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff was a form of fungus, or rather I think, a plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely allied to the yeast-mold, which threw off heat as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it developed. Moreover, it was not a natural growth</seg><seg type="columnLine">but was a culture obtained from the masticated grains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of certain grasses which were then fermented until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spores developed.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T LONGED for a thermometer to enable me to test</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amount of heat thus produced, but I judged it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be about 120 deg. F. Here was a solution to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heating problem which would have been a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">boon to civilized man. At no expense whatsoever, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with practically no care, a house or other building</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be perfectly heated. And, when once started, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants increased. There was practically no limit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extent of heating that could be produced from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first culture. Moreover, the vapor thrown off by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the growing plants contained a large amount of free</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen so that the air was kept constantly fresh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">invigorating. In this ultra-tropical land, human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no need of artificial heat, however, and perspiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">freely and feeling as if I had been in a Turkish bath,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I hurriedly returned to the outer room. As there ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be no restraint upon us and no reason why</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should not go wherever we wished, I urged Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">into activity and some semblance of common sense and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped from the building. Several ants hurried to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards us, and for an instant I thought we were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced back to the hut. But after waving their anten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nae and feet, and, as nearly as I could judge, interro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gating us on some matter, they scurried off and left us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our own devices. Threshing was still in progress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as I passed close to the threshing-floor I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time that the ants were actually using</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical means to separate the grain from the chaff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I had been too nervous and disturbed to notice this</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, but now, with the utmost interest and amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, I watched them.**</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Each great ant was provided with a short section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a log of wood. Moving on the hind feet and guiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roller with the front feet the creatures pushed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">•The fermenting leaves in which the leaf-carrying ants of the tropics</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">propagate their edible fungi, develop considerable heat. Many authorities</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">are of the opinion that thc.se ants thus produce artificial heat purposely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   ••Scientific observers have reported that the agricultural ants actually</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">use small pebbles for threshing the seeds of grosses which they cultivate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sections of logs with the middle pair of legs, present-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as they did so, the appearance of men pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheelbarrows. While some thus trundled their wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">rollers around and around the area, others scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heads of grain before them; others followed after,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering up the waste straw and tossing it to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side; others deftly swept the grains of wheat, as I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">call it, into their leaf baskets, while still others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly engaged in tossing fresh sheafs of the grain</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the arena.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every individual worked with machine-like efficiency</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clock-like precision. Never did one get in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's way; never did they stop their work to rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">or converse; and yet, as far as I could see, no one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in charge. In fact, the impression conveyed was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a machine with each cog of its mechanism perform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its allotted task and functioning without jar or</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent effort and with mathematical precision.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everywhere, where the ants were working, it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same. A short distance from the threshing-floor an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other group was busily winnowing the grain. Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, the advantage of six legs was very obvious. Stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on their hind legs and grasping a leaf-basket</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the front feet, the ants would scoop this full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the threshed grain, raise it high and pour the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents in a steady stream to a basket on the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them. And as it descended, they would vig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orously wave a stiff fan-like leaf with the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of feet, thus blowing the light chaff aside. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures were all so human, so evidently actuated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by intelligence and reasoning powers, that I momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily expected to hear them speak. But aside from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the low hissing or whistling sounds they emitted, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were inarticulate. All communication appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried on by means of antennae and feet. And while</seg><seg type="columnLine">at times their gestures were so expressive and obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even I could guess their meanings, yet I felt con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that it was not merely by signs that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversed but by means of some vibratory or other</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves emanating from their antennae. In fact, once</seg><seg type="columnLine">or twice, I was astounded to discover that I grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">their meaning even when they did not gesticulate. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a most remarkable sensation; something like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation one has, when, listening to a conversation in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some utterly unknown and incomprehensible foreign</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue, a word is suddenly caught which is intelligible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I do not mean td convey the idea that the ants' anten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nae, wireless, as I might call them, was intelligible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. But as I watched them at that time, and later, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would now and then receive flashes of detached frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary communications. Not words or phrases by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any means, but simply meanings or thoughts, so to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say. I would have given a great deal--provided I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had it to give--to have been able to communicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ants, for there were a thousand and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">things I should have liked to have asked them. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was, and still is, I can only observe and form</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own conclusions; can only guess at many things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and can only solve puzzles by theories or conjectures</seg><seg type="columnLine">deduced from my knowledge of the habits and char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acters of related insects in other lands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wandering from the busy threshers and winnowers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who by the way scarcely glanced at us, although they</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been consumed by curiosity, we approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the seed-beds where several ants were carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">transplanting the tender seedlings. It was while</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching them that I again marvelled that these crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures could carry on their agricultural pursuits suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessfully in a land so teeming with destructive insects.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And once more, I became suddenly cognizant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcity of insects here. It dawned upon me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the exception of the bee watch-dogs--still sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">469</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like buzzards far above us--and a number of immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragon-flies that were constantly flashing to and fro,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I had not seen an insect of any kind since we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the ants' domains. But the next moment the</seg><seg type="columnLine">riddle was solved and another astounding discovery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing proof of the ants' super-intelligence was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In removing some of the young plants, two wriggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">grubs or naked caterpillars were exposed. Tossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">these to one side, the ant uttered a low hiss and, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly, from some hiding place among the adjacent</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings, a gigantic green and purple beetle rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth and pounced upon the larva. Reaching out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot, the ant patted the magnificent beetle and stroked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him exactly as a human being would stroke a faithful</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog, whereupon the beetle squatted down with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, fierce eyes fixed on the earth ready to pounce</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon any stray larva that might appear. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt about it; the beetle, like the bees, was domes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticated, was kept by the ants to destroy insect larva?.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH a sudden flash of comprehension, I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the dragon-flies were also allies of the ants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No wonder there were so few injurious insects here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ever-hungry beetles would devour every grub and</seg><seg type="columnLine">larva they could find; the alert, keen eyed, swift winged</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragon-flies patrolled the air and destroyed all flies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moths and other winged pests, while overhead the</seg><seg type="columnLine">droning bees kept constant guard and were ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swoop upon any trespasser they saw, as we knew from</seg><seg type="columnLine">dire experience. Perchance, for all I knew, other</seg><seg type="columnLine">domesticated carnivorous insects might guard the fields</seg><seg type="columnLine">and storerooms by night; but with the corps of day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light patrols I doubted if such were required.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No doubt, also, the ants themselves destroyed count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less larva; and eggs, as well as insects incapable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight, as they tilled the fields. Here again the ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibited intelligence and common sense in advance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our human farmers. Despite every effort of scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the government, our farmers still persist in de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroying birds, mammals, reptiles and carnivorous in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects, and as a result, are constantly fighting a losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle with insect pests. Despite numberless pamphlets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and monographs and widespread propaganda and lec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures proving beyond question that birds of prey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crows, snakes and countless other forms of wild life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_aa well as innumerable insects--are the farmers best</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">friends, the human agriculturalist will still adhere to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hide-bound superstitions, ideas and beliefs and will</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruthlessly destroy the very creatures that, if protected</seg><seg type="columnLine">and encouraged, would save him countless thousands ol</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars annually. Yet here were ants giants to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, super-ants it is true, but nevertheless ants, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">protected themselves and their crops by encouraging</seg><seg type="columnLine">those insects, which naturally preyed upon their ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies. And in a land where insects were a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">times as large and as numerous as in the north, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, by so doing, practically exterminated insect pests</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout their domains. With my mind filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such thoughts, and deeply regretting that I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstrate the matter to a committee of grangers, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the ants busy with their seedlings and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the rear of the buildings. Here were several</seg><seg type="columnLine">large trees, and as I neared one of these, I noticed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of ants busily engaged upon some work which</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather puzzled me. And when I approached closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to witness their operations, I found I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled upon the most interesting and surprising</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of all. In the shade of the wide-spreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches was a great pile of freshly cut leaves trimmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into regular forms. Close to these were several ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I have said. As I reached them, one of the crea-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tures selected a piece of leaf, spread it with his fore</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, and grasping a second piece of leaf with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle feet, he extended the two leaves towards one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his fellows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching down, this second ant picked up a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">elliptical object from among a pile of straw beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Holding this in his front feet, he pressed one</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of it against the edge of the leaf held by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrade. Instantly, from an orifice at the extremity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the object, a thick viscid fluid emerged and left a</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscilagenous trail along the leaf-edge as the ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved the thing slowly back and forth. As I gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinated at this sight, the first ant passed the leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">he held to a third who quickly pressed the edges of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two pieces together and handed them to a fourth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He in turn picked up another leaf, held it for a fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant to smear with the gum-like material, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed all to the sixth ant, who dexterously pasted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last bit to the others and formed a basket-like recep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacle such as I had already seen. Here, indeed, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample proof of intelligence equal to many human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anxious to learn what sort of glue they were using,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what the paste containers were composed of, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged around until I stood beside the first ant who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was using the glue. Imagine my surprise when I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the yellowish, spindle-shaped objects were the liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing larva of some insect! Larva which, like many</seg><seg type="columnLine">other larva, possess a sticky liquid silk with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they spin their cocoons and which, when irritated or</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed, they excrete from their heads. And these</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ants -were availing themselves of this habit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were using the larvas's store of cocoon material to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cement leaves together to form baskets! I was aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that certain ants are known to use their own larva: in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a somewhat similar manner, gumming the edges of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves together to form their own nests. To be sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had never personally witnessed this, but I had read</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous descriptions of the remarkable habit, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that it had been observed and studied by such</seg><seg type="columnLine">eminent scientists as Bruce, Agassiz, Wood, LeConte,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bates, Putnam and others. But here beside me were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants using larva as living muscilage bottles to form</seg><seg type="columnLine">utilitarian articles, and if I were not greatly mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken they were using the larva of some other insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not their own. Of this I soon convinced myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without interference on the part of the ants, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined the larva and found they were the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a lepid-opterons borer. While doing this, an ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived, carrying a couple of large baskets filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">straw and sawdust and containing a number of fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">larva. Setting this down, he picked up the ones that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been used and hurried off. Anxious to see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did with those whose supply of gummy silk had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been exhausted, and thinking perhaps I would thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn more of their origin, I scurried after him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved much more leisurely than had the racing leaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying ants we had seen, but I had hard work to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep pace with him, while Tom, fearing to be left</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, panted after me. My expectations were soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulfilled. The ant headed for a number of small trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the further side of the plaza. Reaching these,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he busied himself placing the sluggish larva in neat</seg><seg type="columnLine">round holes in the tree trunks. Then, while I watched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ripped off a section of bark from another tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposing the sappy, hole-riddled wood, and began ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracting the larva concealed in their burrows. Among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were several brown pupae and these he carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed to one side. Also I noticed several imagos</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, as I had already assumed, were rather hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some steel-blue feather-winged moths very similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our peach-tree borers, although of course far larger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">470</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">being over a foot in expanse. The trees. I saw, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">conifers, and as I could find no others in the vicinity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was forced to the conclusion that they were raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">and maintained for the sole purpose of providing a food</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply for the borer larvae which were of such economic</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance to the ants. Just how the larva: and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">adults were protected from the carnivorous insect at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendants of the ants was something of a mystery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Possibly the beetles, bees and dragon flies had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught not to molest them, just as our farmers' dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cats are trained not to attack chickens or other</seg><seg type="columnLine">live stock, or possibly the borers' habits were sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the thing which puzzled me far more than this</seg><seg type="columnLine">question was, how and where the giant agricultural-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants had learned the trick of using borer larvse far</seg><seg type="columnLine">cementing leaves together to form baskets. Their owh</seg><seg type="columnLine">larvse, as I soon determined, could never have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">used for such a purpose, for they possessed no sticky</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretion. Had the ants seen some other species using</seg><seg type="columnLine">their young, and had they learned to imitate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">process, substituting the borer larvse for their gumless</seg><seg type="columnLine">young? Had they accidentally discovered the borer</seg><seg type="columnLine">larvse exuded a sticky material, which had by chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen on leaves and had fastened them together? Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">had they actually invented the process by using their</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains and their reasoning powers? I could not say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I do not know. It was one of the questions I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have liked to ask them had I been able to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now I had begun to realize that I was hungry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So interested had I been, so astonished at every turn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had quite forgotten that I had not eaten since</seg><seg type="columnLine">early morning. However, Tom still carried our food</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply, and seating ourselves in the shade of a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, we proceeded to eat our meal. Oddly enough, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple matter excited the ants tremendously and caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">more interest and curiosity than they had hitherto</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Evidently their sense of smell was marvelously keen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for though no ant was in our vicinity when we started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to eat, they came scurrying from every direction the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment we began munching our cold meat. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I feared they were angry or that the smell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat had aroused their savage instincts, for there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about their expressions and the business-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like manner of their approach that was not reassur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. But it was soon evident that they had no inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of molesting us. As they came close they rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their hind legs, "sniffed"--I can only describe their</seg><seg type="columnLine">actions by this word--with their antennae, hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and watched us intently. Then, as if utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to understand the matter, they formed a circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us and remained, with antennae pricked for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and eyes staring, exactly like a crowd of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings, watching animals fed in a menagerie. Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly I laughed as the explanation of their behavior</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawned upon me. Being strictly vegetarians them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves they could not understand us devouring flesh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To be sure, their domesticated allies were some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them carnivorous. But to see a dragon-fly or beetle</seg><seg type="columnLine">devour a larvse or a moth was one matter and to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">us strange beings eating what must have appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">like carrion to them, was quite another. We humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it nothing strange or unusual to see a cat eating</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rat or a chicken eating worms, but we would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with amazement and disgust were we to see an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently intelligent human being dine on a mouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a snake or witness a ruminant devouring a haunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mutton. That my surmises were correct was soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved. One of the ants scurried off and presently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">returned carrying a leaf basket, which he rather hur.</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly and timidly placed by my side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was filled with ears of the corn-like cereal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the wheat-like grain. Perhaps the kindly fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought we were forced to eat the meat through want</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anything else and was offering us what he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered proper fare. At any rate his hospitable inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions could not be mistaken, and being thoroughly tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a meat diet anyway, I helped myself to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents and passed it to Tom. The corn, though hard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Tnm i B' '"I the uncooked srain was beyond us!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom declared however, that it could be cooked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if he could crush it, he could make some substi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tute bread, and I knew that the corn, if picked green</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be delicious. No doubt the ants were disappointed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">? .	more than ever when they found we pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fen ed the meat to their fare, but despite our wishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to please our hosts, we could not manage to satisfy our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                          ^ until we had finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">our meal did the crowd of ants leave us. Evidently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, their day s allotted work was over, for instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">letuining to their former occupations, they betook</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to the storerooms, whence they emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">each carrying corn or grain, and proceeded to dine in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open air. I could not but envy the way in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">their great horny mandibles crushed the hard-shelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">cereals, and I was thankful indeed that thev were</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly and not hostile and preferred the products</seg><seg type="columnLine">ol their fields to our flesh and bones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Having dined, they filed into the building with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">niches and quickly took possession of the openings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently each had its own pigeon-hole, and while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the majority vanished down the passages, others</seg><seg type="columnLine">stowed themselves away in the niches in the wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first room. By the time all had retired, every cavity</seg><seg type="columnLine">was occupied, and it was evident that Tom and I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift for ourselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although these ants had none of the rank fetid</seg><seg type="columnLine">odor of the black savages, still they smelled unmis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takably of ant, and the outer air was preferable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that within. Moreover, there were no insects to trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, except for the domestic beetles which appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">confine themselves to larvse, and so we slung our ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocks between two of the trees and were soon sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mg soundly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ants were early risers. They were up before</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn, and like workmen streaming towards fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tories, were hurrying to their tasks before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun rose. Seeing that the majority were headed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grain fields, we joined the throng, for I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to study their agricultural methods, and I dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">not visit the fields unaccompanied, while the bee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards were on duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without stopping to think, I lit my pipe, and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly the entire orderly system of the ants was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">organized. Still, they appeared far less afraid of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flare of the match and the sight and smell of smoke than</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the leaf-carrying ants or even the black humans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their actions in fact savored far more of curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">than of fear, although the tobacco smoke evidently irri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated and troubled them. Every time a whiff of smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached an ant, the creature would shake its head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneeze--if I can use that term to express the action--</seg><seg type="columnLine">rub its face with its fore-legs, twitch its antennae, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">act temporarily confused and almost intoxicated. Realiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that if I were to accomplish anything, and fearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ants might think better of their hospitality, if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted in troubling them, I put out my pipe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forebore smoking for the time being. For that mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter I had not intended to take more than a few puffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                                               :-SvfWg&amp;^;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The next moment one bet after another spread its wings and took flight, until presently all were again sailing, like tiny specks, high in the sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing I had hitherto witnessed m this marvelous land opproachcd Ibis (or sheer incomprehensible wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">471</seg><seg type="columnLine">472</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for my tobacco supply was woefully small and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted if I could secure any substitute in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Apparently puzzled at the sudden cessation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incomprehensible smoke, the ants again fell into line</seg><seg type="columnLine">and proceeded on their interrupted way. Again I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that there appeared to be no leader, no chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">or officer, and that no orders or directions were given.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet the ants seemed to work in unison, to know just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what to do, where to go, how many were required at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each spot, exactly as though all were controlled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single mind. Indeed, the more I watched and studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ants, the more I became convinced that this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a way the case. So intensely communistic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">socialistic had they become, that a sort of mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">telepathy or similar unconscious means of communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion existed among them, and the thoughts or idea^ of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one were common to all. In other words, the mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">reactions or stimulations of the ants were identical</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every individual, and were, in effect, a single unit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as their physical actions were so well co-ordinated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in effect the labor of a number was the labor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a unit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To be sure, when we first arrived, a single ant had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taken charge, and as I have said, he apparently had to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">explain what he had learned of us to his comrades.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But in that case he was dealing with a matter totally</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange and foreign to all their lives, experiences and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mental processes. I had no doubt that, in the case of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any unusual or wholly new event or experience, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ants would be confused, disorganized and at a loss,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for their synchronized minds would not function in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unison, except when dealing with matters with which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all were perfectly familiar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I noticed, too, that all the ants I had so far seen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were apparently of one class. All appeared to be sex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">less workers. There were no warriors, such as are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">common to most ant communities, fellows with over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">developed jaws and physical characters adapted for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">defensive and offensive duties. All I had seen were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">exactly alike in every detail, and I wondered if, through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">countless generations and with the domesticated insect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">allies to protect them, the warrior class had gradually</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been eliminated through evolution or if, being no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">longer needful and merely a burden on the community,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they had been destroyed as they developed. Of course,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">somewhere, there would be a queen or queens, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there must be consorts or drones. Possibly, I thought,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ants I had found sleeping in their cells on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day previous had been males who performed no manual</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">labor, and I determined to investigate later and satisfy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">myself regarding the breeding habits and social sys-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tem of the ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We had now reached the grain-fields, and with per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect system and as if by mutual consent and under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing, the ants began their task of weeding, culti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vating and reaping. They worked with marvelous</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidity and precision, and their six legs and powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandibles enabled any one of them to perform the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of several men. Neither did they require tools</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any sort. A nip of the chitinous jaws was sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cut down a stout stalk; their powerful, hard, hooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">claws hoed and raked the earth as well as any steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">implement, and weeds were uprooted and tossed aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their powerful jaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VERY few injurious insects were found, and these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were instantly pounced upon and destroyed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big Carib-beetles who roamed about among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">toiling ants. I wondered how, with insects so ruth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly and completely eliminated, the corn and grain</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be pollinated. But of course there were the bees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and, presently I discovered that there were innumer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able lady-beetles, as they are called. These, I noticed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unmolested, the ants evidently being aware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their usefulness, and I hunted about, until I found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetles' larvaj---ferocious-looking, flat-bodied creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">with short, stout legs, rough, hairy bodies and stupen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous, serrated sickle-shaped jaws. At sight of me</seg><seg type="columnLine">they backed away, snapping their great jaws, shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ugly heads and lashing their stubby tails in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most menacing manner. Although comparatively small</seg><seg type="columnLine">in relation to the ants and other insects, yet they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">far too large and powerful to be treated with impunity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were in fact, about the size of large Tom-cats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with jaws twice the length of their bodies, and I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a single bite would sever a man's wrist or arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They were, however, most interesting creatures, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently represented several species. Some were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most naked, being sparsely clothed with stiff bristles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while others were covered with warty protuberances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly set with short, barbed hairs to which the own-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers had attached bits of leaves and empty skins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small insects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus camouflaged, they were wonderfully protected</seg><seg type="columnLine">and concealed. Indeed, as I watched one of them rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing motionless and completely hidden under his cloak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of empty skins of former victims, a small thrip came</seg><seg type="columnLine">flitting by. Seeing the skins of his fellows clustered</seg><seg type="columnLine">together on the leaf, and mistaking them for a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">colony of his species, he dropped unsuspectingly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot. Scarcely had he alighted when the crouch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing larva sprang forward with surprising agility and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the unfortunate thrip in its hungry jaws. Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly the juices were sucked from its still palpi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tating body, and, a moment later, its empty skin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to the collection of trophies on the larva's back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a way, it was an old story to me. Countless times</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had watched our own insignificant aphis-lions cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turing and devouring their tiny prey in the same way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and following almost identical habits. But despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">this it seemed like a new discovery and a most aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishingly interesting one to see these twenty-pound</seg><seg type="columnLine">aphis-lions doing the same thing. Often, in my en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomological days, I had marveled at the lack of interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in insects' habits and lives exhibited by the average</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Over and over again I had tried to arouse an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in such matters among my layman friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but without success. But now I realized why men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women give no heed to the most remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits of insects about them, and yet become</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensely interested and engrossed in the far less</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable habits of birds and mammals. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely a matter of size. Were our insects the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of our mammalia and birds, the public would find</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much or more interest in them. Even I, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a deep study of entomology and was thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive to the fascination of insect life, was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrilled, excited and engrossed by the revelations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant insects about me, in a way I had never expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rienced when observing insects of normal size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently, 1 noticed a new arrival. At first I mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">took him for an undersized bumble-bee, for his colors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were much like those of the big fellows who had at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked us. But as he blundered about among the corn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tassels and I had a closer view, I discovered that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a honey-bee. Also, as he was busily engaged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">loading his pollen-baskets with the yellow dust of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corn flowers, I discovered that he was one of the sting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less bees so abundant in tropical America. Thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a little fun at Tom's expense, I called him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, showed him the big bee, and quite casually ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended my hand and poked the insect with a finger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom yelled and grasped my arm, but too late. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">473</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bee, angry at being so rudely interfered with, uttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ominous buzz, swung about and struck viciously at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with its abdomen. But it was all bluff. He pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed no sting, and I laughed heartily at Tom's ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of combined terror and amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somewhere, not far distant, I knew the bee must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a nest and a store of honey. Honey would, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, be most desirable, and I watched the depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bee as, laden with pollen, it spread its wings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew off. It headed directly towards the ant village,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I mentally decided to have a thorough search for</seg><seg type="columnLine">its hidden sweets when I returned to the buildings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I would no more have dared to leave the vicinity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the toiling ants and approach the village alone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom, than I would have dared to enter a den of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry tigers. Ever in the air above, the great bees</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled about, looking like the tireless-winged vul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of the tropics, and faintly to our ears came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the droning of their pinions like the distant exhaust</seg><seg type="columnLine">of airplanes. As long as I was with the ants I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe from the giant bees, but I felt sure that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment their eyes detected Tom and myself alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would swoop upon us and wreak vengeance for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">death of their companion. I need not have worried, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. The bees, like ferocious watchdogs, once they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned that we were to be treated as friends of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their masters, would not have molested us. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the time I was not aware of this, and whiled away</seg><seg type="columnLine">my time as best I might, watching the ants, studying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the habits of the few useful insects that I saw, mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing friends with the ferocious Carib-beetles. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about these big coleoptera appealed to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despite their almost overwhelming pungent odor, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a characteristic of their family, they were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog-like in their behavior, and they were gloriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificent in their colors of metallic red, green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue ornamented with sparkling dots of gold and sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver. Lying on the ground in some shady spot, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright roving eyes watching every move of the ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would wait patiently until their keen vision or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signal from an ant apprized them of the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a larva. Then, with a bound and a rush, they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be upon it, exactly as a terrier springs at a rat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despite their fierce aspect and their somewhat nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispositions, they were quite docile, and although at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first they showed distrust and fear of Tom and myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and edged away whenever we approached them closely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I very soon managed to win the confidence of one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. Digging about with my hunting-knife in spots</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, to my entomologically-trained eyes, promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of hidden larva, I unearthed several and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked them within view of the beetles. Thereafter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of the creatures followed me about constantly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched my every movement. Tom, however, fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">shy of them. The negro, I have always noticed, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">very timorous when near strange dogs, and Tom could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not overcome his fear that one of the beetles might</seg><seg type="columnLine">6nap at him at any moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As mid-day approached and our appetites warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">us that it was time to lunch, the question of our food</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose. There were apparently no mammals in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicinity for us to shoot, and the only edible substances</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be the corn and grain. Many of the ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">of corn--it was not true maize but so very similar, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">always think of it as corn--were in the green milky</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage and, somewhat hesitatingly, as I was not sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the ants would take it, I pulled off several of these.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ants, however, gave no heed to my actions and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering a number of the ears, we prepared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunch on green corn. But while the cereal was edible</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a raw state, it was not particularly tempting and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to try roasting it I realized that to build a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fire might cause a panic among the ants, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat torn between my desire to dine on roasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears and my dislike of exciting or frightening the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures, who had so far shown nothing but friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kindly feelings towards us. But my curiosity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness their reactions, my appetite, and my insatiably</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimental mind decided me. Gathering some dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">corn stalks, for there was no better fuel near, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving a few yards from the ants to a spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grain had been harvested and the earth was bare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I kindled the fire. The reactions of the ant3 were as</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable as they were unexpected. At the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiff of smoke they had swung about, their eyes star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and their antennae pointing in our direction. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they saw the flames and sparks, with one accord</seg><seg type="columnLine">they dropped their work and came hurrying towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. For an instant I felt sure we were in for it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterly I regretted my actions. But instead of at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacking us as I had feared, the ants dashed directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the blaze. Almost too late I realized that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually about to throw themselves into the flames.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without stopping to think of consequences, I seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foremost ant, shouting to Tom to follow my ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample, and with all my puny strength, shoved him</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly back. For the fraction of a second he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted, struggling and snapping his jaws. Then, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently realizing that there must be some reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my actions, he fell back and gazed, fascinated, towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TOM, meanwhile, terrified at the ants as he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had nevertheless obeyed me and had succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in driving back two ants. He had been less fortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I, however. One of the creatures had snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him and had torn one sleeve of his coat completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and had left an ugly cut on his arm. But our</seg><seg type="columnLine">interference, brief as it was, had checked the impet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uous rush of the creatures. It was hopeless for us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of holding back the whole mob, but the first three</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now more cautious and, as they drew closer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the heat of the blazing corn-stalks, the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped- hastily away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One individual had approached too closely and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly singed one of his feet, and limped off to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance. The others, perhaps through co-ordination</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mentality or perhaps through reasoning, now realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the fire was dangerous and stood quietly regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, antennae and postures expressive of the utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder. I was amazed. Every intelligent wild crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture I had ever known had invariably exhibited in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctive dread of fire. Even the leaf-carrying ants had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been wary of it; yet these ants were attracted by it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would have blindly thrown themselves to destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion like stupid moths and gnats had we not forcibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevented them. But after all, why should they be</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of fire? They had never seen it, and no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">their first impulse at sight or smell of anything new</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to rush upon it. In fact, now I came to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the matter, I had often observed that this was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">common trait of ants and that their brains appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be incapable of either fear or caution. But it argued</seg><seg type="columnLine">well for these ants' intelligence that they should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood our actions and should have resisted their</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural impulses. However, I was convinced that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be wise to kindle fires within the ants'</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach, and I foresaw a rather dismal prospect of sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisting upon raw food while we were with them. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we had this fire--or rather the coals, for the stalks</seg><seg type="columnLine">had quickly been consumed--I decided we might as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well follow out our original intention and roast the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corn. The ants looked on with intense curiosity as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">did this. When at last I raked the ash-covered, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">474</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">what blackened ears from the smouldering cpals, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed one to the nearest ant. As he sensed its heat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hurriedly drew back and stood regarding it sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piciously. His attitude, his muscles tensed ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap away, his forward-turned antennae and his every</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression were exactly like those of a skittish horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding the approaches of a stranger. But as Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I sank our teeth into the truly luscious corn, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant gingerly touched the ear, became more confident</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last bit off a piece and tasted it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly he became excited and, apparently sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moned by him, his comrades crowded about, smelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tasting the roasted corn. Very evidently it did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not appeal to them, for each in turn ejected the masti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated kernels from his mouth. But it was equally cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain that they were vastly astonished at discovering</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such a great change could be wrought in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cereal by placing it in the fire. Finally one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the ear and hurried with it in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the village. What he did with it I cannot say. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps he desired to test it on the young ants; possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was to be presented to the queen, or for all I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was to be preserved as a precious relic and a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarity for future generations to marvel at. I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure whether it was the effect of my fire or the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that caused the ants to cease their labors in the fields</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turn towards their homes. Naturally, Tom and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined the crowd, and as we passed along, I tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">count the ants in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Much to my surprise I discovered that there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not over two hundred and, as far as I could judge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically the entire population was present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course there might be many in the buildings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground chambers. Many more might be in dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant parts of the fields or gardens; and there might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">others engaged in other pursuits. But when we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started out, no others were in sight, none were thresh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, winnowing or making baskets, and I felt convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the entire colony did not number over three hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred individuals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when we reached the village, I was astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find at least another hundred busily threshing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">winnowing. Presently I noticed that these appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be somewhat smaller, lighter in color and softer-boiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the others. Then I caught sight of several ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying off broken fragments of papery, parchment-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like material, and the solution dawned upon me. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">threshers and their companions were newly-emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants which had hatched from their pupae during our</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence, and the objects being disposed off were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains of their pupae skins. A new wonder filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind. A wonder at a fact which had never before</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed me during my long study of insects. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">were creatures, who until a few hours previously had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been inert, helpless things incapable of voluntary move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment or thought, and yet, no sooner had they cast off</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pupal coverings and emerged as ants, than they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to work upon the tasks of the old experienced adults</seg><seg type="columnLine">and apparently as expert, as skillful and as accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the by no means simple processes, as though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been doing the same things for years and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">after vigorous training.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was far more wonderful than the newly-hatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">chicken scratching for its food; it was as remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it would be for a newly-born infant to step into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor car and drive it through traffic or to solve a</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem in trigonometry. Unquestionably it was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">herited instinct, and I wondered if, in future genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, the human race will have developed to a similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent and if, some tens of thousands of years hence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new-born members of our race would be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the places and the duties of the aged without un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dergoing the long and, in a way, wasted years of train-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and instruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even more remarkable than their aptitude at</seg><seg type="columnLine">age-old tasks of their ancestors, was the fact that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed no curiosity or interest in us. Certainly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be inherited instinct. I felt positive that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of the tribe had ever seen human beings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, when we had arrived the new generation</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been in an advanced pupal stage and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to emerge. Hence they could not by any possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility have inherited a knowledge of us from their par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ents. Why then, I wondered, did these newly-hatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants appear to regard us with the same indifference as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they regarded their fellows? The only way I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">account for it was to assume that the ants from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very beginning, regarded everything they saw, smelt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard or experienced, as matters of course. In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, I decided, they would fall easy victims to enemies</seg><seg type="columnLine">or to any untoward or unusual event. If they emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find themselves surrounded by deadly enemies, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would assume instinctively that all was well. If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged to find the crops being devastated by insect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pests, they would think it nothing unusual. And yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that case, their inherited instincts would force them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to undertake work, to do things that would be impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible of accomplishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it must have required generations to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">domesticated and trained the insect-allies. No, which-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever way I tried to solve the mysteries of the ants'</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives, instincts and intelligences, I ran, figuratively</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking, against a stone wall of evidence in rebuttal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at last I gave it up in despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time, still desiring to learn where the queen or</seg><seg type="columnLine">queens were secluded and to discover more about their</seg><seg type="columnLine">home life, I followed the ants into the passages leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the exterior buildings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was little difficulty in locating the Royal Cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber. As I entered, my attention was centred on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other occupants of the place, rather than upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen herself. A dozen or more ants were working</seg><seg type="columnLine">busily, and my first hasty glance showed me they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually making bread. By this I do not mean that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were kneading dough and baking it,in ovens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they were cracking and masticating the grain</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their jaws, mixing it into a pasty dough with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sticky substance and patting it into loaves or pel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets with their feet. Curious to know what they were using,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went closer and discovered that it was honey, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already half-suspected. As fast as the little loaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sweetened flour were formed, other ants would pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up and carry them to the queen, who was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormously fat and lazy that she was actually unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feed herself. The bored expression in her eyes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasfi, indifferent manner in which she opened her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth to receive the pellets of food from the jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her servants, was indescribably ludicrous, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazingly like many old dowagers I had seen. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole scene was far more like a dream than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reality. I thought of the old nursery rhyme, for here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally, "The Queen was in her parlor, eating bread</seg><seg type="columnLine">and honey."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT night we dined in royal style. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively simple matter to locate the bees'</seg><seg type="columnLine">store of honey in a hollow tree, and as the owners</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stingless and powerless to harm us, we helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves. Tom rigged up a crude sort of mill consist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of a flat stone and a rounded cobble and, after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of Spanish-American women and Indians, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground a quantity of corn and grain on this rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ready metate. Mixed to a paste with water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">475</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped in corn husks, these were baked in hot ashes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when dipped in our honey, proved most delicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">after days on a meat diet. In order not to attract the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants and endanger their lives and limbs, we built our</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire at some distance from the buildings and waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">until all the ants had retired, before lighting it. Evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently the ants, once they had ended their days' work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not easily disturbed, for despite the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they must have scented the smoke, which blew across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buildings, no ant put in an appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite my interest in the ants and the friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner in which they had received and treated us, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still as anxious and impatient to escape from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country as I had been before. No civilized man would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been content to remain indefinitely in such a place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though we wanted for nothing in the «jy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature comforts and were literally monarchs bf all</seg><seg type="columnLine">we surveyed, in a truly magnificent and interesting land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, when I tried to analyze my own feelings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover why I should be so intent on leaving the place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was rather at a loss. I had neither kith nor kin in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside world and I was surrounded by the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">things in which I was and always had been most inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested, and I had enough material for study to last me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of my life. I finally came to the conclusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was actuated by a combination of causes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to make my discoveries known; the gregarious</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct of the human race; the inborn restlessness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the explorer, and most important of all, that peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inexplicable kink in the brain of man which never</seg><seg type="columnLine">permits him to be content or satisfied but is forever</seg><seg type="columnLine">urging him on, forcing him constantly to seek some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing better or something beyond his reach. It might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be called ambition, desire, purpose or any one of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand different names, but that did not explain it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was this urge, this insatiable longing for some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he has not got, that has led man to all human</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress, civilization and attainments. And while</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed by all men, no matter how primitive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage, yet Nature has so ordered things that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more advanced, the more cultured man becomes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more he develops this desire. Thinking upon this mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter as I lay in my hammock, I concluded that in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay the real, the greatest distinction between man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower animals. Not a single creature I could bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mind possessed this mental state. Here, for example,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were these ants. In their actions, their habits, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">intellect, they were fully the equals of many races,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had learned to till the soil, to raise crops, to domes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticate and train other creatures. They had made at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">two quite notable discoveries or inventions, and in unity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of effort, in social life and organization and in success-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful communism, they were far ahead of average human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had completely done away with leaders and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity of rulers and consequently they had eliminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppression and caste. There was no poverty, no riches</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them. They had attained, to a measure, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">state which many of my fellow men prate of as Utopia.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But to what purpose? Boiled down to actualities, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did was to eat, toil, sleep and propagate their</seg><seg type="columnLine">species. They possessed no arts, no sentiment, no cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, no romance, no literature, no history, and while</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were no doubt perfectly happy and contented, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that almost any fate would be preferable to lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing such an existence. Their very unity of purpose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their co-ordination of brains and effort had utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed all individuality, all personal rights and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderations. No member of the community could possess</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything more or less than his fellows; there could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no striving for something better, no incentive for</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress. And yet, how could this be when I had proof</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that there must have been progress, must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">individuality, must have been an inherent desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">better themselves in the past? Surely some one ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have thought of training the other insects to</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy the insect-pests that beset them. Some indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual must have invented the use of a roller for</seg><seg type="columnLine">threshing .grain, even if he only discovered it by acci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent. Some one ant must have visualized utensils for</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying the grain and must have found the way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">imake baskets. Some ant must have constructed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such ideas, such conceptions could not have come</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly to all at once. Such things could not be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of inherited instinct. Even in the cultivation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lands, the garnering of their crops, the use of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grains, they showed the result of invention, of progress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if their lives from time immemorial had been pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poseless, as I had assumed; if they had been satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with things as they were; if they had not possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of urge or ambition, why should they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished all these things? The more I thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it the more confused and puzzled I became. Did all</seg><seg type="columnLine">living things possess to greater or less degree that</seg><seg type="columnLine">never-ending desire for improvement? And, come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">simmer it down, so to speak, did the human race with</seg><seg type="columnLine">all its super-intelligence, its boasted progress and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightenment, really accomplish anything more than did</seg><seg type="columnLine">these ants? When all was said and done, were not all</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lives, all our efforts, all our civilization, our wars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything devoted to enabling us to eat, sleep, toil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">propagate our species? And to what end? Men toiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they might eat and sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They ate and slept that they might toil, and eat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep again. They propagated their species and reared</seg><seg type="columnLine">their offspring, in order that their offspring might live</seg><seg type="columnLine">to toil and toil to live, and they themselves toiled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived with the sole aim of enabling the younger gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation to take their places and toil and live in an end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less circle. What did it all mean; what did it all lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">to? Why was man--for that matter, and the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals also--created to go on forever in this way and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get nowhere? And why was I who, by a mischance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found myself so situated that I need not toil to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor live to toil, so anxious to return to a land where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would be, to all intents and purposes, of no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance and where I would possess no more true</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom or individuality, than belonged to one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants sleeping in their underground cells? Like so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">other problems and puzzles that I had faced since enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this land, it was insoluble as far as I was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned and, I therefore gave it up and lost myself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had determined to set out on a further search for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exit from the country without more delay, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following morning we started on our way. I had rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered how the ants would take our departure. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not think they would hinder us, but I did assume</seg><seg type="columnLine">that our leave-taking would arouse some curiosity. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was disappointed. Not an ant paid the least heed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and that was not surprising, for I noticed that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second crop of the creatures had hatched out during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night and that all the ants in sight were newly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged individuals who had never seen us before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What, I wondered, became of the older ants? At this</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate the colony would soon increase until the food sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply could not support them and the village would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcrowded. Of course they must swarm; new queens</seg><seg type="columnLine">must leave the place and establish new colonies, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet we had seen no swarming, no signs of young</seg><seg type="columnLine">queens and still there had been two broods of new ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">since we had arrived. In some ways obviously, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits were quite different from any ordinary ants, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">476</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I rather regretted leaving them until I had thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied their lives and habits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T EADING from the gate in the wall was a well</seg><seg type="columnLine">' marked pathway which we followed, partly because</seg><seg type="columnLine">it afforded easier walking and partly because I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather curious to know whither it led. Perhaps half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile from the village we had left, we were greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised to come upon another wall exactly like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, though evidently much newer, as in places the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud plastering was still damp. Within it we could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roofs of houses, and beyond, tilled fields wherein ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were laboring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like the wall, the buildings were of recent construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and in fact were not entirely completed, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of ants were working upon them. The fields</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, were freshly tilled. Piles of weeds and pebbles</seg><seg type="columnLine">culled from the soil were scattered about, and ants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still weeding and preparing the fields for planting. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">then was a newly established colony of the agricultural</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants, and I at once jumped to the conclusion that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a community started by young ants with a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">queen from the parent colony. But it is a rash matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to jump at conclusions in this land where everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">is strange and new. As I approached the nearest ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that they were not young but old individuals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, among them, I recognized the fellow whose foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been burned in our fire. For a space I was puzzled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but presently the solution came to me. Among these</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants it was not the young but the old who went forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and established new colonies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As fast as enough young had emerged to manage the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">War-Ilkc dwarfs attacking an occidcnt</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">From "Ant Communities," by Henry C.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fields and carry on the studies of an established com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munity, the older ants left and started a new village</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fields. Being experienced and, in the social or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganization of the ants, of less value when aged, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were better fitted for this pioneer work. Also, it oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred to me, that it was quite possible that although</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newly emerged young instinctively carried on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to which they had been born, they might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">inherit the knowledge of starting new communities. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">any rate it was a far more human habit than most</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants possessed when establishing new colonies. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">young were brought up in a new environment and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came thoroughly able to take care of themselves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own progeny, before being forced to go forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and face the world and its dangers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each generation in turn would establish new colonies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the younger ants to continue with the old com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munities, and thus the larger and more important col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onies were always maintained by young, virile, active</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and more numerous ants. What, I wondered, became of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old ants eventually? How long did they live under</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal conditions? Did they continue to move on</seg><seg type="columnLine">indefinitely until they died of old age or did they at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last find a quiet and toilless old age in some colony? Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, were they put out of the way, killed off as so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much deadwood, when they became too old and stiff in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their joints or too feeble in intellect to be of further</seg><seg type="columnLine">economic value? In all probability, I decided, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually decreased in numbers, either through natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">deaths, through accident or other causes so that, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">having started a certain number of colonies, their places</seg><seg type="columnLine">were taken by the succeeding generation. I wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, how they managed to subsist until their fields were</seg><seg type="columnLine">producing grain, and also whether they brought their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own queen with them, or carried off a new one each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time they moved on. Even whilst I was pondering on</seg><seg type="columnLine">these matters, the first question was solved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A number of ants arrived, each carrying its burden</seg><seg type="columnLine">of grain or corn, and hurrying to the storerooms, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posited the load and hurried off. All were young ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unquestionably from the colony we had just left, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplying the immediate needs of their elders from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own stores. It was a striking proof of the splendid co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation of these creatures, and a good demonstration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of filial duty. They might permit the old ants to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">home--might even drive them forcibly away--but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no intention of permitting them to starve to death</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the new colony was on its feet. By the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">order of things, and as a result of their habits and cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toms, this was most essential, for the entire existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the race and the successful spreading of communities</seg><seg type="columnLine">depended upon the older ants being supported and main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained in health and strength until a colony was pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductive and a new generation or two had appeared. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not so easy for me to settle the question regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the queens. The ants made no move to interfere with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us---perhaps they assumed that we were moving to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new colony along with them--and I wandered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage which I assumed would lead to the Royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber. I was not mistaken. There was the obese,</seg><seg type="columnLine">complacent, blas6 female and her court. But whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was the aged mother of countless offspring or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">youthful flapper I could not determine. To my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">all queens looked alike, although to the ants they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were doubtless as distinct in forms and features as are</seg><seg type="columnLine">women to the eyes of men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several hours thereafter, we came upon colonies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the agricultural ants in various stages of develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Some were well advanced and the crops were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing or were even being harvested, and in one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two we saw numbers of newly-emerged ants. Here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wonderful field for study with an opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make most interesting discoveries and to observe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to record all the similarities and differences existing</seg><seg type="columnLine">between these ants and our own, and to make compari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons and reach conclusions as to the effects of heredity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and environment. At any other time and under other</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions, I should have welcomed the opportunity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as it was, I made only the most cursory inspection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the various colonies and kept to my main purpose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching for an outlet from the place. Passing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last of the ants' farms, we swung into the woodland</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more and headed towards a spot on the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge which I had previously selected as our first goal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had traveled perhaps ten miles, and had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed a fine fat hare for our mid-day meal, when, glanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the trees, I noticed a moving object which</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather puzzled me. At first sight I took it for one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black men, bending over as if searching for some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. Then I saw that it moved on all fours. It did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, however, resemble any other creature I had met,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">477</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and as well as I could judge, on account of the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the shadows of the trees, it appeared to be jet</seg><seg type="columnLine">black in color. It was, I judged, about ten feet in length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it moved about with a peculiar, indescribable man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of most efficiently searching every nook and corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its vicinity. Had I been in any other land, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought it a giant black bear, for its movements</seg><seg type="columnLine">were far more ursine than feline. Even here, where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had almost convinced myself that there were no large</seg><seg type="columnLine">mammals, I felt fairly certain that the strange crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture must be mammalian. And that it might be and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all probability was a powerful and dangerous beast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not question. But no matter how dangerous it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be, there was nothing we could do save remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent and motionless where we were, in the hopes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing would move on without seeing or scenting us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a time I thought this would be the case, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature came no nearer and in fact at times actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved away from us. Then, as if finally locating that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for which it was searching, and with a confident man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner it had not hitherto shown, it turned and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying directly towards us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wa-la!" muttered Tom between chattering teeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He been smell tha blood what drap from the rabbit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He been a-trailin' we 'long o' tha blood, Chief." There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no doubt about it. He had crossed our trail, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelt the hare's blood--and perhaps our own scent as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well--and was after us. I had already drawn and cocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">my revolver, and Tom had unsheathed his arrows in</seg><seg type="columnLine">readiness to defend ourselves to the best of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability. But I well knew that a pistol bullet was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">little avail against such a huge, powerful beast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I doubted if the arrows had power enough to pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate its thick hide. If need be, we would fight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lives, but as long as there was a chance of escap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing without facing the beast, I intended to avoid battle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the creature had smelt the hare's blood, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a possibility that it would be satisfied with the hare</seg><seg type="columnLine">and would not attempt to attack us. To be sure, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hare would be scarcely more than a mouthful for it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it probably had never before smelled a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">being; nearly all wild creatures have an instinctive</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of man, and while it was devouring the hare, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be able to get far enough away to be beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">its reach. So, dropping the hare, and in terse words</seg><seg type="columnLine">explaining my ideas to Tom, we hurried as fast as</seg><seg type="columnLine">our legs could take us in the opposite direction. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked back, and through the intervening foliage I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the dark bulk of the monster where it was busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the hare. A moment later, Tom yelled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurted by me like a deer, and behind me I could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crackling of branches and the running footsteps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our savage pursuer. It was hopeless to think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">outrunning the thing in the forest, and, shouting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom, we raced for a large tree, whose outjutting slab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like hips extended several feet from the trunk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a small niche or open space with a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening. Here we could be attacked only from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front, and exhausted and spent, we reached our hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected refuge not a moment too soon. As we dodged</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the big bark-covered walls and swung about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ferocious creature was less than twenty yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind us. And as, for the first time I had a clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the beast, I saw to my absolute and complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement, that it was- an ant. He was so monstrous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so gigantic that it did not seem possible even in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of impossibilities. But there could be no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. He was far larger than the agricultural ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly twice the size of the leaf-carrying ants, and far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more formidable than either. From head to tail he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shiny, jet black, reflecting the light like burnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel. His head seemed all eyes and terrific jaws. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fact the jaws were far larger than the head and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">as keen-edged, as heavy and as deadly as battle axes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A plucky Liliputian attacking an Occi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dont Ant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">From 'Ant Communities." by Henry C.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">McCook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">His great eyes wore a terrifying, savage glare; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">antennae were drawn back, his jaws opened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended and his great clawed front feet were</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised ready for action as he rushed upon us. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have I seen a more inexpressibly ferocious beast, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had we been in the open, he would have made short «■</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of us, for despite his size he was as quick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">agile as a panther.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Raising my revolver, I blazed away. My first shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">went wild, but my second tore a gaping hole in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye. Partly blinded, no doubt, he swung slightly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side and banged into one of the outspreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">hips of the tree. This was our salvation. Before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could recover himself, I fired the other bullets into</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at short range while Tom drove three arrows at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great beast now within a dozen feet of us. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows might as well have been straws. His thick'</seg><seg type="columnLine">polished coat of chitinous mail turned them aside as</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily as would steel armor. It even proved efficacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">against some of the pistol bullets when they struck a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing blow, but the others crashed through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell. From the gaping wounds, thick, yellowish juice</seg><seg type="columnLine">oozed, emitting a sickening, acrid stifling odor. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite the damages done by my bullets, the creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far from dead or even mortally wounded. Half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded as he was, riddled with holes, he staggered off</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few yards, and shaking his head and clashing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws, gathered himself for a second - charge. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there for a moment, I reloaded my weapon with</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling fingers, and I noticed for the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his abdomen ended in a sharp point and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this protruded an immense barbed sting. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly I placed him. He was one of those strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitary ants of the tropics; those giants of their fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily who possess both stings and powerful fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandibles, and who roam the jungles alone, blindly at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacking every living thing they find, devouring any</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature they can conquer, and are so savage, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisonous that even those of normal size are regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with terror by the Indians. And this one, gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength for another attack upon us, was a monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">of monsters, hundreds of times the size of the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to science. All this flashed through my brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the few short seconds it required to reload my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol. The next instant I was feverishly kicking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraping, pawing dead leaves, twigs and bits of bark</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a pile at the entrance of the tiny refuge where</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stood. As the giant ant's muscles tensed and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great jaws opened, I scratched a match and touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flame to the little pile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the match flickered and went out and a tiny flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran through the dead leaves, the ant charged. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rush lacked the speed and strength of the first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he was evidently weakened by his wounds, still it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was terrifying enough, and with cocked revolver I</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited him, determined to withhold my precious am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munition to the last, and hoping against hope that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">478</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would be checked by the rapidly-spreading fire. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt the heat and smelled the smoke, he hesitated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a pile of leaves flared up, the flames scorched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and head, and hastily he drew back. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he stood there, shaking his head, rubbing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned legs and peering at the flames. Then, as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">deciding the fire was a new enemy to be summarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealt with, he leaped forward and regardless of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke and flames, savagely attacked the blaze with</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws, sting and feet; throwing the firebrands aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">biting at the flames with such ferocity as I have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessed in any beast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again and again I fired at him. Tom, his fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving way to primitive savage frenzy, was belaboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature with his bow, pelting him with clods of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth and yelling like a fiend. But our case se*med</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless. The giant ant Was rapidly destroying' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire; he was within six feet of us, and my bullets ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently had no effect. Then, suddenly, help arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a most unexpected quarter. There was a rustle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of leaves, the swift patter of hurrying feet from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the tree, and the next instant a huge beetle</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed upon the scene. I say huge, but in comparison</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the maddened ant he appeared puny. In his large,</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft abdomen, his embryonic wings, his steel blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">color, he closely resembled one of the blister-beetles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or as they are more commonly termed, Spanish-flies;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that he was a distinct species and a new genus</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me I knew at a glance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he caught sight of the fiendish ant he halted, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">protruding glistening eyes fixed on the scene. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his short club-shaped antennae sheathed in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">recesses out of harm's way; with his useless wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">half raised; with his abdomen curled sharply upward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he raced for the ant. It seemed the height of folly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a suicidal act for this soft-bodied, harmless-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature to attack the giant ant. I expected to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter turn, snap the beetle into bits and resume</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attack upon us. But nothing of the sort happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Busy with the fire, the ant failed to see the beetle</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it was upon him. With a leap so swift the eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">could scarcely follow it, the beetle sprang at the ant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alighting upon its back. Instantly there was a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">report like a miniature explosion, a misty cloud en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped the two insects, and Tom and I staggered back</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost overcome by a smarting, burning, choking ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible sensation, as if we had been exposed to mustard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas. Scarcely able to see through the tears that filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">my burning eyes, I saw the great ant stagger back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the beetle spring lightly from its perch. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment the ant was writhing and twisting, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle, always maintaining a safe distance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible sting, the clashing jaws and the thrashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, darted back and forth, like a dog worrying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded bear. But each time, instead of nipping at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his struggling foe, he would swing quickly about, raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">his abdomen and would discharge a clov-l of vapor</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a loud report. I was scarcely as much amazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his temerity in attacking the ant as by his methods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was, of course, familiar with the habits of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon Bombardier-beetles, those little ground-beetles who',</seg><seg type="columnLine">when angered or frightened, discharge an infinitesimal</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantity of ill-smelling gas from their abdomens to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accompaniment of an almost inaudible pop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the beetle before me was of a totally different</seg><seg type="columnLine">genus, one of the blister-beetle family I felt sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the vapor he was discharging at his fallen foe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was obviously having a deadly effect. In fact, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge ant was even now helpless, barely able to move,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after one or two more of the beetle's gas attacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remained quiescent and evidently quite dead. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a most marvelous exposition of the triumph of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">science over brute force. The soft-bodied, short-jawed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inoffensive beetle had easily defeated and destroyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic armed and ferocious ant without even ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posing itself to serious danger. But what if he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention to ourselves? What if he should dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge his deadly gas at us? Grateful as I felt for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his timely intervention, I was half minded to shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beetle at once, for my eyes still smarted from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects of the slight amount of gas we had been ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to and I knew that a full charge would render</seg><seg type="columnLine">us helpless, if it did not destroy us at once. I also</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that the odor and the intense burning proper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties of the vapor were precisely like the smell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of the oily secretions exuding from the blister-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetles. In fact, it was this strongly irritant material,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has given them their popular names and has</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused them to be used in medicine in the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">plasters and counter-irritants in many lands. If then</seg><seg type="columnLine">this huge beetle was, as I felt sure, a member of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this family, it was no wonder that his secretions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient to destroy the ant, especially when concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated and discharged in large volume directly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As all these thoughts rushed through my mind, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the triumphant beetle closely, expecting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment to see him turn towards Tom and myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But-1 need not have worried. He was examining the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead ant, feeling him with his antennae, smelling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carcass and, as nearly as I could judge, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly puzzled to account for the wounds caused by</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pistol balls. No doubt it was the first time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever destroyed an enemy by his gas attacks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then had found the defeated insect's life-juice exuding</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a dozen or more gaping holes. Puzzling as it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been, it apparently made little difference to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With his stout short jaws, he quickly tore a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening in the ant's abdomen, and began devouring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature. He ate ravenously, and at last, gorged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to repletion, he balanced himself on his hind legs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meticulously cleansed his head, antennae and jaws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed the crumbs from his waistcoat--if I may use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metaphor--and with a regretful glance at the store</seg><seg type="columnLine">of food still unconsumed, he trotted, off and disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With deep sighs of relief Tom and I stepped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">our shelter. For a moment we stood gazing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains of the giant ant. Tom stooped, picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the huge disarticulated jaws and grinned. "Seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to me," he chuckled. "This been a mighty fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of cutlash, Chief. Ah been goin' to ca'y it along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' if Ah comes to fightin' another of dis gent'man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ah boun' for to use it far bash in he haid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom's idea was excellent. The jaws were as large</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as strong as butchers' cleavers, with edges almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as keen, and the rounded knob-ended joints with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been connected with the muscles before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle had devoured the tissues, made excellent handles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would, as Tom had said, serve as most vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deadly weapons at close quarters and, moreover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would prove useful as tools or implements and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would save much wear and tear on my hunting-knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the almost skeletonised ant was to provide us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with still another addition to our armament. Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truding from his half-devoured abdomen was his im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense sting, a needle-pointed rapier of chitin</seg><seg type="columnLine">over eighteen inches in length, as flexible as tempered</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel and almost as light as wood. With some diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty, I cut it free from its tissues and muscles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously examined its shining black length with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp recurved barbs near the tip. A tiny scratch</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that poison-soaked weapon would mean death</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, mounted on a stout shaft, it would be a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">479</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">formidable spear. To find and cut such a staff was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy, and having bound the sting to its four-foot shaft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and having protected its point by a bamboo sheath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we left the scene of the recent drama and resumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">our interrupted journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAVING sacrificed our prospective meal, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched about for possible game and were at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last forced to fall back upon frog. Tom killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big batrachian with a blow of his ant-jaw axe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus proved the efficiency of his new weapon to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire satisfaction of us both. We lunched beside a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair-sized stream, and the cool limpid water appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">so attractive that we decided to have a swim before</seg><seg type="columnLine">resuming our journey. Stripping off his scanty gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, Tom dove from the bank, and through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear water I could see his brown body swimming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a giant frog, far below the surface. Like all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his race, he was almost amphibious, and I watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, as he moved slowly along, close to the overhang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bank near to the bottom of the stream. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as I was on the point of plunging in to join</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, I saw him veer aside, strike out furiously and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot to the surface. Wild terror filled his eyes, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was distorted with fear, as he swam madly for</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore. He had seen something to terrify him I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I peered towards the bottom of the stream, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an effort to discover what it might be. But the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion caused by his frantic movements obliterated</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything, and while I thought f?r an instant that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a glimpse of some huge dark creature, scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a shadow, I could not be sure it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely the effect of the disturbed water. The next in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant Tom was on dry land stammering and quaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was several minutes before he could speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">coherently or I could make head or tail of his gibberish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lordy!" he managed to exclaim at last. "Wa-la,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief; Ah been see the mos' frightsome al'gator Ah</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever see. Yes, indeed, Chief. An' fo' tha Lard yo'</seg><seg type="columnLine">come nigh to losin' yo' nigger Tom, Chief. He been</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss grabbin' me by no more'n a inch, Chief."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Alligator!" I ejaculated. "Are you sure, Tom?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I spoke, I crouched on the bank and again peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the depths but could see nothing. Still Tom in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted that a monstrous saurian had attacked him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had barely escaped with his life. Unquestion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably he had seen something, but I could not believe it</seg><seg type="columnLine">an alligator or crocodile. The clear water, the smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">pebbly bottom were not such as the saurians prefer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in all my experience I had never before known</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the reptiles to lie in wait and snap at pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing objects far below the surface. Always, they rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seize their prey at or near the surface, or when</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, rush at it.	N</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, knowing Tom's character and how easily he</seg><seg type="columnLine">became terror-stricken at any unusual sight, and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects under water are distorted and magnified, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that it was far more probable that he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">an overgrown and harmless salamander or even a tad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole. So sure was I that no alligator was lurking below</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I rose, prepared to dive down myself and investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate. But Tom begged me not to attempt it, and, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membering how many unexpected perils had been met,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought better of my impulse and decided on a wiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The discarded portions of the frog, on which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lunched, were near at hand, and dragging these</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bank, we attached them to the end of a tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">vine, weighted them with stones so they would sink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lowered them into the stream at the spot where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom insisted he had seen the reptile. For a moment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing happened and then, from among the stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the bank, a huge horrible head darted out, seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bait, and with a jerk that tore the vine from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, dragged it back among the stones. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazed. Even in the brief glimpse I had had, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it was no alligator, no crocodile. The immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved jaws armed with huge spike-like teeth were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of a saurian or of any reptile with which I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar. And yet what else could the monster be?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All my curiosity was aroused and I determined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover what manner of rapacious beast lay in wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Gathering the remaining portions of the frog,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we bound them and a number of stones together with</seg><seg type="columnLine">vines, attached them to a stout vine and fastened this</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the tip of a long, strong pole. This we fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">securely so that it extended several feet from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. Stretching myself at full length, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ant-sting-tipped spear poised, I told Tom to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bait into the stream. As the ripples caused by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall smoothed out and the frog-meat slowly sank, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered my spear until its point was but a foot above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot whence the creature had appeared. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">both hands gripping the shaft, I waited ready to plunge</seg><seg type="columnLine">it into the monster the moment he emerged from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lair. For a space I feared he would not expose him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, that his hunger had been appeased and that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">bait would not again tempt him. But I had not counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the thing's insatiable appetite. Once more, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearsome head lurched forward with wide-spread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravenous jaws. But this time the bait was further</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and following the monstrous ferocious head, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot or two of pale, livid, fleshy body. With all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">force I drove the spear downward, aiming for the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the head and body joined. I felt the spear bury</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself in yielding flesh, the shaft was wrenched from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp, and as I sprang back, the stream frothed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">churned and was transformed to a miniature maelstrom</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the wounded maddened monster. Keeping well back</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shore, Tom and I watched with fascinated</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, expecting each moment to see the terrible thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise from the waves and dash at us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually the commotion subsided, the water cleared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cautiously we approached the bank. With a yell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom leaped back, pointing excitedly. Then I, too, saw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Close to the bank, half-floating, belly up, and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">wriggling and twitching spasmodically, was the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thing. I shuddered as I looked at it. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had I seen a more diabolical looking beast. Its flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened segmented ten-foot body with its rows of short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clawed, stout legs resembled that of a giant centipede.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along the sides were rows of great warty protuber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances bearing short, stiff bristles. Its immense flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">head was covered with broad plates of chitin, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous terrible jaws were still opening and closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">viciously. As it moved feebly in its death throes, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned partly over and its big cruel eyes glared at us</seg><seg type="columnLine">balefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No wonder poor Tom had been terrified. To meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a monster under water would have been enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drive the bravest man half mad with fear. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster's days were over; my spear had proved its</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth and the ant poison had done its work thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughly. But as I had felt sure, the beast was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptile. He was an insect; the larva of some gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">species of Corydalis, a monstrous hellgromite or dob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son; a stupendous prototype of the ugly, savage, aquatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">larvse of the neuropter, common in our own brooks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so much in demand by anglers as bait for black</seg><seg type="columnLine">bass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately Tom had discovered the beast in time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still more fortunately, his discovery had probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved us both from horrible deaths, for I had no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">480</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that scores, hundreds of the creatures lurked in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream and in other streams, and bathing, with such</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsters about, would be far more perilous than diving</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a nest of man-eating crocodiles. At last the huge crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture ceased to move, and approaching it cautiously, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw rocks and sticks at it. Our attack brought no</seg><seg type="columnLine">response, not even a tremor. Feeling convinced it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite dead, we managed to throw a loop of vine over</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of its jaws and dragged its head within reach, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I might retrieve my spear. The struggles of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster had snapped the staff of the weapon, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sting itself was uninjured, and with considerable diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty, I wrenched it free from the dead hellgromite's</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh. Then, having again bound it to a new shaft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feeling quite elated at our destruction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous larva, we resumed our way.	v</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had been delayed and interrupted so frequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had made but little real progress. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid-afternoon; we were miles from our cave, too far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ants' villages to return to them, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains still in the distance. It was evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we would be forced to pass another night in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, but this did not greatly trouble us. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hammocks, we felt quite well equipped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons, and while we had learned that we were sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by many known and still more unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies and dangers, we had grown so accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing such perils that night held little terror for us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I preferred not to sleep in the forest, however, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we proceeded, we searched the country for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">open spot wherein to camp. An hour or two after</seg><seg type="columnLine">our destruction of the hellgromite we reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the forest and came to the verge of a broad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather sandy plain or prairie bare of vegetation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exception of bunches of coarse grass and clumps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cactus and agaves. Some of the cacti were of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant candelabra variety and were even larger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the largest of those on the deserts of our Southwestern</seg><seg type="columnLine">States. They were in fact, real trees and amply strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to sustain our hammocks. Here was an excel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent camp-site. We would be in the open, away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the myriad of gnats, moths and beetles; we could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be attacked without warning except from the air--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was dry and free from the miasmic mists of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest. Selecting a clump of several large cacti at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short distance from the forest edge as a likely spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our camp, I _ directed Tom to gather some dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">firewood from under the trees, and sauntered on in</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance towards the group of cacti. Never dreaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">that any danger could be near in this open country, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave little attention to my immediate surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, and without the least warning, a two-foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular section of the earth sprang up within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards of my feet. To my startled eyes it had pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisely the appearance of a man-hole cover thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. Then, as the lid dropped back, exposing a round</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole, a chill ran down my spine. From the aperture</seg><seg type="columnLine">two great, hairy, brown arms appeared, each tipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with immense black talons. Before I could regain my</seg><seg type="columnLine">wits, before I could move, a horrible head followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A rough, hairy, brown head' with immense down-curv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, tusk, like black fangs, and with a gro.up of small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming-red, piercing eyes. I needed no second glance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thing was a giant tarantula--one of the trap-door</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiders--a deadly, terrible creature. Confused, unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to decide on what to do, I stood there, inert and help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, as the fearful creature climbed swiftly and silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its silk-lined burrow. A moment and he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounce upon- me. I could almost feel the agony of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripping claws, could almost sense these awful fangs</seg><seg type="columnLine">burying themselves in my neck. Then life, action,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense came back to me. With a wild cry, I whipped out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> my pistol and fired. But my hand shook, the bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">went wild, and striking the sand a few inches in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crouching tarantula, it flipped a shower of dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pebbles into the thing's eyes. Surprised, dazed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly blinded, confused, the giant spider sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly back, bit viciously at the offending sand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily forgot his human prey. Taking careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">aim, I pulled the trigger, and from the great hairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoras I saw a puff of dust and fur fly as the missile</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it served only to infuriate the beast, to remind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him of my presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again I levelled my weapon and pulled the trigger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but only a click followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The revolver was useless. I had forgotten to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">load after my battle with the ant. To turn and run</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be worse than hopeless. In less than a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps the monstrous spider would be upon my defence-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less back. And I had no time even to turn. I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great tarantula gather his feet together for a spring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw him hurl himself forward. Unconsciously, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively, I thrust out my hands to ward him off. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ten-inch shell, he came hurtling upon me, his ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible talons outspread, his awful fangs ready to bury</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves in my body, his dozen red eyes gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">like coals of fire. In my mad terror of the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature, I had forgotten that I still grasped my</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear. Not until my staring, dilated eyes saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarantula upon me, not until I felt the impact of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body against the weapon, did I remember it. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a rush, recollection and swift action returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Grasping the shaft with both hands, taking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward step, I lunged forward and upward with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">my strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt the weapon go home; I dropped the shaft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged headlong to one side. One great claw snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my coat and ripped the sleeve from shoulder to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist; vile-smelling, horrible liquid spattered me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stumbling to my feet, not daring to look back, I rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindly away, until tripping over a stone, I sprawled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">full length on the sand. Dazed, shaken, trembling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">•utterly spent, I stared back, expecting to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster about to finish me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But he had other matters to occupy his mind, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed any. In a perfect paroxym of rage he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhing, twisting, rolling about; biting with inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrible ferocity at his own body, his own legs and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my spear which had transfixed him. It was a horrible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrible sight, and Tom, who had witnessed the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire affair, had dropped senseless from sheer terror;</seg><seg type="columnLine">had actually fainted; for the first time in his life. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">my bullets had failed to do, my spear had accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished. The tarantula's minutes were numbered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Already his struggles were becoming weaker, and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time I had reached Tom's side and he had recoyered</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness, the gruesome, horrible beast was still in</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. My spear, however, was ruined. The dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider, in his convulsive rage, had bent and broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tough chitinous blade beyond all hope of repair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was maddened at my loss, for twice the weapon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">served me well and I owed my life to it. But if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic spider had robbed me of my trusty javelin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was to supply me with a substitute. His great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved, pointed fangs were larger and heavier than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant's sting, and while they bore no poison, as I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were not to be despised as weapons. With diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty overcoming my repugnance at the task--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly unable to coax or threaten Tom into approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the dead creature--I hacked and cut its fangs free.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unlike the ant's sting, which was beautifully tapered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly cylindrical and straight as an arrow, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider's fangs were curved, thickened on the convex</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">481</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">edge and possessed deep longitudinal grooves. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears they were useless, but their similarity to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient English bill-hooks was striking, and I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would prove most effective -weapons. Passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to Tom and keeping the other myself, we care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully retraced our way to the forest, keenly searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">each square foot of the desert as we advanced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After my experience, we had no desire to sleep on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that open plain. The horde of night insects in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest was far preferable to prowling tarantulas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only stopping long enough to cut and fit handles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our new weapons, we hurried into the forest until we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were beyond sight of the plain, before preparing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make camp. It was already very late; we had no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lose, and quickly we lit a fire, cooked our meal, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slung our hammocks by the light of the flames. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we slept little that night. As before, myriads of- in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects attracted by the fire, buzzed, blundered, crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flew about us, and I was far too nervous and upset</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the afternoon's adventure with the tarantula to sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Altogether it was a nightmarish time. But dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">came at last, and with the new day and the welcome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, our spirits rose. Very soon Tom secured game--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hare and a strange creature quite new to me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which resembled a porcupine without spines. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfasted well. By the light of morning, the expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riences of the preceding day seemed dream-like and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreal; but there were our tarantula-fang bill-hooks</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prove their reality, not to mention the ripped sleeve</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my coat. We had no mind to attempt to cross that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of sandy plain, however. Where one giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap-door spider dwelt, others probably dwelt also, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew the ferocious character of the creatures far</seg><seg type="columnLine">too well to take any chances with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, although the route was far longer, we decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow the forest edge to our objective point. Hith-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erto, all the sliders we had seen were rather small</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were of the geometrical orb-weaver group, quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmless as far as we were concerned, although ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and terrible in appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This had already caused me a great deal of surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no little wonder, for in a country where other</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects were so abundant and of such huge propor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, it might be assumed that the spiders or arachnids</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be proportionately abundant and of proportionate</seg><seg type="columnLine">size. Yet, until I had met the tarantula, we had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">no spider of any sort more than three feet in length.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had met none of the predatory jumping-spiders so</seg><seg type="columnLine">abundant in other lands, none of the wolf-spiders, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">funnel-makers or the long-legged web-makers. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had we seen any of the arboreal my gale group which</seg><seg type="columnLine">are usually so abundant in the tropics. Why, I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered, were spiders relatively so scarce? I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain it, could find no hypothesis to account for it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I was duly thankful that they were rare. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the day was done, however, I was to discover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to the question. We had passed well beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene of our adventure with the tarantula, and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a district where the country was broken and out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crops of rock projected above the earth. Several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had noticed large, dark-colored insects winging back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forth above the plain, but had given them little</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention, knowing they were neither solitary hornets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ichneumon-fiies nor giant bees. But as we stopped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest for a time, my eyes idly followed the creatures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently one of them swooped quickly towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the plain, vanished for a few moments, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reappeared, carrying some object in its jaws and fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Somewhat curious as to the prey it had secured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	watched it as, turning, it came flying heavily in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. As it drew near, I saw that it was a wasp,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a big dark-blue, dusky-winged, slender-bodied fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps three feet in length and that its burden was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big fat-bellied spider. Its similarity to our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar mud-wasps was striking, and like them, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently had the habit of preying upon spiders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing the manner in which our own mud-wasps</seg><seg type="columnLine">sting their victims into a comotose state, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall them up in their mud nests to provide food for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young wasps when the latter hatch out, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt that the big wasp humming past us was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound for its nest on a similar mission. A few rods</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond where we sat, it volplaned down to a rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge and vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anxious to learn more of its habits, I rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously approached the spot. Clamboring over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks I soon detected the wasp. It was clinging to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">nest and was so busily engaged in forcing the stupe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied spider within it, that it paid no attention to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence. The nest was a beautiful structure, a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly symmetrical urn-shaped affair of smoothly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moulded clay with its base attached to the rock; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect example of the workmanship of the potter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasp group, and as true in form and as gracefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed as though modelled by an expert human pot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter on a potter's wheel.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But unlike the potter-wasps with which I was fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar, this species was evidently gregarious, for clus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered on the rocks near the first nest, were a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. Some had the orifices tightly sealed, indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating that their owners had stored their supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">living provender within and had completed their ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ternal duties. Others were partially completed; others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ready for occupancy but were still empty; while</seg><seg type="columnLine">on several the big wasps were resting, as though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were tired out with their labors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I watched, two more wasps arrived with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiders, and I realized that here was one reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comparative scarcity of the arachnids. No doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	thought, there would be numerous colonies of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasps scattered throughout the country and the ag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gregate might be sufficient to keep down the spider</seg><seg type="columnLine">population. Still, I had noticed that all the spiders</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured by these wasps appeared to belong to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolf-spider group, and I could not sfie how or why</seg><seg type="columnLine">the decimation of their numbers should have any effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the spiders of other species dwelling in remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots, in the jungles and forests. As a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, however, I was really more interested in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasps' nests than in the spider problem. Seeing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">graceful, vessel-like nests had put an idea in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. If wasps could mould pottery, why should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom and myself do the same? Hitherto we had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to roast or broil all our food and we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorely felt the want of utensils for holding water on</seg><seg type="columnLine">several occasions. Calabashes, gourds, large nuts or</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar objects appeared wanting in this place, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen back upon sections of bamboo. Somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">near there must be a clay bed, and mentally deciding</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hunt this up and try my hand at the ceramic art,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we failed to find an exit through the mountains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my return, I rose, and calling to Tom, we again</seg><seg type="columnLine">trudged on. But our way was beset by difficulties we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not foreseen. Everywhere among the rocks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasps' nests. Whichever way we turned, we came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Many were like those I had seen, but others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were immense, rough, irregular affairs containing many</seg><seg type="columnLine">cells. We had literally stumbled into a hornets' nest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but fortunately for us the mud-wasps, like their ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary prototypes, were docile, peaceful insects and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not offer to attack us. Still, I did not care to tempt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  *	Many of our solitary wasps constrdct clay nests of beautiful vase or pot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like form. For this reason they are popularly known as "Potter wasps."</seg><seg type="columnLine">482</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them too far, and finding we could not continue on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our route without passing through the wasp colonies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we swung far to one side and headed for a defile or</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley which was sparsely wooded. But here we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no better off. Although the mud-wasps were left be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind with the bare rocks, the valley fairly swarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with black and yellow wasps. And these, too, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">spider-catchers. The air fairly vibrated with them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew perfectly well that they were quick-tempered</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows, very different from the good-natured mud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasps. Everywhere, too, the trees were festooned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their gigantic top-shaped nests of gray paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as we watched them from a safe distance, scores,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of the big yellow-jackets were constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">arriving, each carrying a stupefied spider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No wonder the spider-world had not multiplied or</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown to gigantic proportions. Betwixt the \ mud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasps with their penchant for prowling wolf-spidera</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the open, and these paper-makers, who apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured woodland spiders only, there was little chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the arachnids to increase in numbers or in size.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt, too, there were many other colonies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasps and hornets who depended upon spiders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had not chanced to find, for it would be most</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual and quite contrary to all known habits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects, to have the entire spider-eating wasp popu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation of the vast territory confined to one small area.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why the mud-wasps should be here I could well under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, for their habits required the presence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock ledges near the edge of the open plain; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherever there were such conditions, there would no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt be mud-wasps. While I could not see that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunt of these black and yellow fellows was in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect different from countless other wooded valleys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still there might be certain details--as the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trees suitable for paper making--which would ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peal to the hornets. At any rate, it was obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had taken complete possession of the place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I for one had no longing to dispute their rights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAKING a wide detour, we passed through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretch of jungle and came out upon a grass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered area ascending at an easy angle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first slopes of the mountains. Scattered about, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-hidden in the grass, were scores of what I at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first took to be great rounded boulders. Suddenly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted, staring, for one of the rocks had seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move. Squinting in lLa brilliant light, shading my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes with my hand, I gazed, wondering if it was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of the shimmering heated air rising from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain; if it was an hallucination of my brain due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a coming attack of fever, or if I had merely imagined</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Then once again the massive boulder heaved itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward, moved slowly forward for a few yards and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again remained motionless. I hurried forward filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with amazement and curiosity at this seeming miracle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then abruptly I roared with laughter at my own stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pidity. The thing was no rock but a gigantic turtle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stupendous land-tortoise. The dome-shaped carapace</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strikingly similar to those of the giant tortoises</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Galapagos Islands but immeasureably larger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being fully ten feet in length and rising for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above the waist-high grass. I stood awed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed at thought of the countless centuries which</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have passed since this huge creature first emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its egg. The Galapagos tortoises are estimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be from two to five hundred years old, and if these</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows in the grass about me grew at a proportionate</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate, then their ages must be measured by thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years. And as we earner near and the mammoth</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortoise raised his great head and looked at us curi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, his bleary eyes seemed to gaze upon us puny</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings with all the wisdom of the ages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immense age, too, was indicated by the countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep wrinkles on his skinny neck, the worn and bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered scales upon his enormous feet, his scarred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered shell, and the blunted worn-down edges of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaws. What marvelous stories these multi-cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenarians could tell could they but speak! What amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing events they must have witnessed in the transform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation of the world about them! But the hoary old</seg><seg type="columnLine">patriarch within a few yards of us was not interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">in anything aside from the grass within his reach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, after assuring himself that we were not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared and that he need not withdraw his wrinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck and elephantine feet within his shell on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">account, he worried a bunch of grass from the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and munched it slowly, deliberately, like a toothless old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Having devoured all the herbage within reach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reared himself ponderously, lurched forward a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards and again sank down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Something in his movements reminded me most</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcibly of an Army Tank, and seized with a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">boyish impulse, I handed my weapons to Tom. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">some difficulty, I scrambled onto the giant turtle's</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. Of course he paid no attention to my presence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for through his immensely thick carapace, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have felt my movements, and my weight was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to him than that of a grasshopper upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of an ordinary tortoise, and he continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">graze as calmly as ever. As far as I was concerned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might as well have been standing upon an upjutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. Grinning from ear to ear, Tom stepped towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beast's rear and dealt a resounding blow upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">its stout scale-covered tail. Instantly I felt as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I were experiencing a terrific earthquake. The great</seg><seg type="columnLine">carapace rose upward, it shook, swayed, rocked, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawling flat on my stomach, I clung desperately to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rough surface with hands and feet. Like a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">masted ship in a hurricane-lashed sea, the tortoise</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurched forward, thoroughly startled at the treatment</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had received, and at each forward heave of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponderous legs progressed a dozen feet or more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom, elated at his success, and bellowing with laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, followed after, belaboring the turtle's tail and pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing no heed to my frantic shouts to cease. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast's pace was by no means slow' and Tom was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to run to keep up with us. But the rolling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocking motion was more disturbing than that of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboring ship, and at last, unable to stick it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer, I allowed myself to slip earthward and landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely on all fours in the grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly, as Tom ceased his efforts, the turtle came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a halt and resumed his interrupted breakfast as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing unusual had occurred. It had been a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">unique and remarkable experience for me, and I as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured Tom that as a means of transportation, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turtle was even more tank-like than in his appearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Passing through the herd of the giant tortoises, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked that here were creatures who had nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fear from any enemies. No living beast, not even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dinosaur, if such had existed, could have made any</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression on those mighty shells. The fiercest, most</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage insects, would have found the thick scale-pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected skin of neck and legs impervious to mandibles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stings. Even man, unless equipped with a power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful rifle, would find it difficult indeed to harm the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts, and, once they withdrew within the shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their shells, they would be as secure and safe as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though barricaded in a battleship's turret. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmless, useless creatures provided by Nature with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample means of protection in lieu of means of defense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet I knew that, should civilized men ever invade</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">483</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this country, they would wantonly destroy these</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous tortoises as ruthlessly as they had extermi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated the giant turtles of the Galapagos*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time since entering the place, I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">thankful that it was not inhabited by my fellow men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the turtle plain we came to broken country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and throughout the day we climbed, toiled, tramped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched the mountain side; but all in vain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every ravine and canon we explored proved a blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead, and when night fell we camped where darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">found us among the rocks, too tired and spent to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trace our way to a better spot or to worry over dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comforts. Nothing disturbed us, there was no reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for any living creature dwelling in such a desolate</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot. Even the customary ground-beetles were lack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. With daylight we had a magnificent viewvof the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, for we were at a higher altitude than we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had previously attained in our explorations. Far below</seg><seg type="columnLine">us stretched the green, sloping plain dotted with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown, rounded backs of the giant turtles. In far dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance we could distinguish the farms and villages</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the agricultural ants. Barely visible on the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite side of the valley was the low, swampy, jungle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered area with the aphis groves beyond. Like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast brown patch the desert plain of the tarantulas</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke through the greenery, and we could make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocky ridge where the spider-eating mud-wasps</seg><seg type="columnLine">had their nests. So far, we had covered a large part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this familiar area, but there was an immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of territory still unknown to us and this I</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied carefully. Ilere, once more, I saw the expanse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of orderly arranged trees, which we had seen from</seg><seg type="columnLine">our cave on the other side of the valley, and which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had assumed was a second settlement of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans with their aphis orchards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I was now much closer to it and the more I</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied it the less it looked like the settlement and</seg><seg type="columnLine">orchards of the blacks we knew. I could not exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe or analyze why or how it appeared different</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, at the time, I did not give very great attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it, for I thought it in no way strange that two</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlements of the race should vary considerably. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">another spot, and much nearer to us, was a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen or more low, rounded, dome-like objects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing prominently among the vegetation. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite different from anything I had hitherto seen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in general appearance were more like huge beehives or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kaffir kraals than anything else. I longed for glasses</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which to examine them and, as I had done scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of times before, I blamed myself and figuratively kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself for an unmitigated ass for having left my</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment, including my field-glasses, at Tupec when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">first started to explore the tunnel. But to regret my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of foresight was futile, and I strained my eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tom did the same, trying to puzzle out what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structures were, whether in fact they were structures</seg><seg type="columnLine">or natural formation, and trying to pick out a route</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would lead us to them. If they were indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial things, buildings of any sort, then in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability they might be the homes of human beings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A short time previously I should have said certainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than probability, but experience had taught me</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to jump at conclusions, and after the agricultural</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants, I realized that, even if artificial, these beehive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like affairs might be the homes of some form of insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. But whatever they might prove to be, I had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">up my mind to have a look at them at close range.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From former experience I knew that the puzzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs would prove far more distant when we began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tramp towards them than they appeared to be when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">•	These tortoises often reach enormous size. Specimens have been known</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">large enough easily to carry two or three men upon their backs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed from the heights. But I planned to cross the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley and thoroughly explore that side, retaining our</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave as a headquarters, before continuing on the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we now were, and it would be only a few miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of our way to visit the dome-shaped things. De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scending the rocky slope was far easier than ascend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it, and very soon we were again in the turtle pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. Crossing this, and searching for game, for we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very hungry, we swung to the north and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered an expanse of thorny jungle where we secured</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of the odd mammals which I have likened to porcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pines minus spines. Like all other mammals we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen they were rodents, but I noted, as I cleaned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinned them, while Tom prepared his fire, that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of a very primitive type and undoubtedly new to</seg><seg type="columnLine">science. In many ways they were more closely related</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the capybaras and guinea pigs than to the porcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pines, and to my surprise, I discovered that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">marsupials, pouched mammals. Here, indeed, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great discovery. The only American marsupials hith-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erto known were the opossums, which are carnivorous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And here was a marsupial rodent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This set me to thinking, and I wondered if it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible that the hares and marmots of the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also marsupials. In fact, for the time being;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">my discovery of a new order of marsupial mammals</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the South American continent quite obsessed me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I recollected that, unless I escaped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, this discovery along with all my others, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">die with me and might remain unknown to the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">for centuries or perhaps forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Regardless of. their peculiarities and their interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a zoological viewpoint, the creatures proved ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellent eating, and when we at last resumed our tramp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the clean-picked bones of the beasts were left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, I had no fears about future meals, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the hour Tom knocked over one of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">marmots. As I had rather expected and had hoped, he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, proved to be a marsupial, and later I discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the same was the case with the hare-like crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. Yet, despite the fact that I was daily, hourly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, making astounding scientific discoveries and find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all previously conceived ideas completely upset, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came as something of a shock when Tom stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the nest and eggs of one of these animals. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were walking through a patch of forest, carpeted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense ferns, when Tom exclaimed that he had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bird's nest. I hurried to him, for we had neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen nor heard birds, and I had instantly assumed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had found the eggs of some reptile or possibly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">484</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">some huge insect. But my first glance assured me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was wrong and Tom was right. At the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a cluster of ferns, and filling a slight depression in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, was a bulky nest of dead leaves and down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing five elliptical pale-buff eggs slightly speckled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bluish-green. They were about the size of hens'</seg><seg type="columnLine">eggs and, so I at once assumed, were eggs of some gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">linaceous bird, perhaps incapable of flight. Tom, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, was far more interested in their edible properties</seg><seg type="columnLine">than in the identity of the owner, and picking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the eggs, he deftly sliced off one end. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled surprised cry he dropped it as if it were red</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord A'mighty!" he exclaimed. "He been got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat inside he."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I STARED incredulously at the contents of the egg.</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed by the smashed shell. Squirming feebly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mess upon the earth was the embryo of a four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">footed creature! For a brief instant I thought it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptile, but the bedraggled scant hair, the ears, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole appearance of the embryo precluded that and</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved it to be the inmate of the egg of a mammal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was astounding. And yet I knew that the Platypus</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Duck-bill of Australia lays eggs, as does the echidna</seg><seg type="columnLine">or spiny ant-eater. Excited at this fresh discovery I</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined the now defunct embryo and readily identi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied it as the young of the hare-like creature we knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">so well. The long ears, the rudimentary tail and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly developed hind legs were unmistakable. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, in its embryonic state, the creature appeared far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more like a kangaroo than a hare and a new idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed to my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was it not possible that the kangaroos had evolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from rabbits or vice-versa? Here were creatures, evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently very low in the scale of mammalian evolution,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who resembled hares as much as kangaroos, who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">marsupials, who laid eggs. They were true missing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">links, and more than ever before I regretted my in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to make my discovery known to my fellow men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to add to the world's knowledge of life and evolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. No scientist was ever in a more exasperating</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unenviable situation. I was making epochal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolutionary discoveries that could be of no benefit</seg><seg type="columnLine">either to myself or to the world. Even my discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hare's eggs (for I must thus refer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures) was of no real benefit, for they were unfit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for food, and food to Tom and myself was of far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more importance than scientific facts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, leaving the nest and its contents undisturbed, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded on our way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gave little attention to our surroundings. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was far too busily occupied with theories and</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculations. I wondered if all the marsupial mammals</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the place laid eggs. I wondered if the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged from the eggs, blind and helpless, or if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatched out quite as able to care for themselves as</seg><seg type="columnLine">newly-hatched chickens. And I wondered whether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">females incubated the eggs or left that duty to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and sun. In fact my mind harked further back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I began to wonder if the black savages we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">met might not also deposit eggs. Had I not personally</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed their young being cared for in their subter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranean chambers, I might even have speculated on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility of these being marsupial humans, for noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing seemed too wildly unreasonable or bizarre in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Filled with such thoughts, I failed to note that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left the wooded area behind and were now in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush-covered country. Presently, however, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that the sunlight had disappeared and, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must be clouding over, I glanced up. Above the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trees to our right hung a dark cloud blotting out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, a funnel-shaped lowering cloud with its whirling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting stem descending earthward; an ominous-look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cloud presaging a tornado.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it was coming directly towards us. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its path and death was imminent. For a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant I hesitated, confused, searching about for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safest direction in which to flee. Ahead the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed more open. There was less brush,_ and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we failed to out-race the coming twister" we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be free from the danger wind-hurled trees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches. The next instant we were running at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost speed while behind us we could hear the roar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the oncoming cloud and the day became as</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim as twilight. Panting, exerting every effort, strain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing every muscle, we dashed through the shrubs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes that tore at us and held us back like clutching</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. At any moment I expected to feel the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast of the tornado, to see the brush torn up by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresistible force of the revolving gale, to be hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside bruised, helpless, perhaps broken and mortally</seg><seg type="columnLine">injured. Then, above the roar of the cloud, came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">staccato patter like rain or hail upon the vegetation</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to us. Heavy falling objects fell upon the leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and earth about me and pelted my back. As I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of them I screamed like a maniac, and halting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mad race, stared with bulging eyes at the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace in our rear. It was incredible, impossible, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful to be real. But it was, there was no doubt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. All about us great winged insects were dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth, insects a foot or more in length, insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping like falling leaves from the vast army, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless millions of their fellows who formed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring black cloud now passing directly above our</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads. Thousands were falling about us, striking us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the force of descending wild-ducks killed in mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight. Thousands covered the earth, the bushes. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly as they fell, their flimsy dark wings dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their bodies, and aimlessly, excitedly, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed hither and thither, climbing over us, scratch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing our exposed flesh with their horny claws, causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to shake, shiver and tremble with terror and</seg><seg type="columnLine">loathing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At my first sight of them I had realized that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ants, swarming ants equipped with temporary</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings; ravenous, creatures able to overwhelm us, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear us to bits, to devour us alive. It was horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond words, enough to drive anyone mad, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming, fighting, beside ourselves, we staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward inch by inch, away from the main cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ants. Still we remained unharmed, untouched, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitten. Not one of the myriads of hurrying creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">had offered to molest us, and gradually our first mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror decreased, and a measure of confidence returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us. We might yet live to escape. The main body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ants had passed on, the thousands that had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">had scattered and were intent on hurrying away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now only a few were dropping down from above. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were almost smothered in their cast-off wings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wings lay six inches deep over the ground and cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the brush-like icy snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then common sense returned to me and I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered that swarming ants are almost as harmless as</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming bees; that they are far too much occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their own affairs and their new queens to bother</seg><seg type="columnLine">with anything else, and that our danger--if ever there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been any--was over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The swarm had passed on. Only a slender line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">laggards streamed across the sky above us, and glanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back, I saw, for the first time, that they rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the locality of the dome-shaped structures I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">485</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was it possible these were giant ant-nests; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swarming insects had issued from them? Avoid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the few hurrying ants that remained under foot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging to one side out of the reach of chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">stragglers from above, I hurried towards the spot I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen. Presently we left the brush behind and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us saw the group of bee-hive-like objects. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no doubt of it. They -were ants' nests. Ants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurrying about them, winged ants were still issuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the apertures and were taking flight. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ants quite distinct from any we had hitherto</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. They were far smaller; they were frailer, weaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, and their undersized blunt mandibles convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that they were no fighters and that we were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any great danger from them. At our approach, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few turned from their duties and rushed towards us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the instant they came within scent of our per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons, they turned tail and scurried off, evidently as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much afraid of us as we had been of their swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows. In color they were a peculiar greenish-gray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a most unusual shade for ants, and I wondered how,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with such small dull jaws, they could hold their own,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how they erected such huge structures, and what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">depended upon for food. By now the last of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged ants had vanished and the others had retreated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their homes, evidently having been warned of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of unknown beings by the ants who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first inspected us. Stepping closer to better examine</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great, rough-surfaced mounds, I discovered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of being constructed of mud or earth, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be formed of some woody substance. Pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly, I thought, it was a material akin to paper, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the paper made by hornets; and taking out my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting-knife, I chipped off a bit of the surface. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave vent to an ejaculation of surprise. Under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull-gray outer surface, my knife had exposed a green</seg><seg type="columnLine">sappy interior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was exactly as if I had cut away a bit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer bark of a living tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A MOMENT later I knew that this was the case.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here and there upon the surface of the structures</seg><seg type="columnLine">small shoots were sprouting out. About the bases</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the nests I found slender roots, and on one were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a number of good-sized, fleshy leaves. The things were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not artificial; they were living, natural vegetable</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths. Like the famous ant-tree of Java, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">distorted, bulbous, pithy roots of some tree or plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">within which the ants dwelt.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greatly I longed to examine the interiors, to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termine whether they were filled with natural cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers and galleries like the Javanese ant-tree, or whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ants had tunnelled their own passages and rooms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the apertures were far too small to admit my</seg><seg type="columnLine">body--even had I wanted to enter--and I knew it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a hopeless task to attempt to dissect one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tough gnarled roots with my knife. As I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, examining the huge warty root and trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">place its family botanically, I decided that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a root at all, but the short, stocky trunk of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown genius, in some ways very much like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yaretta plant of the high Andean deserts, and which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is used extensively as fuel. Like the yaretta, it grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dome-shaped masses; like the yaretta, the leaves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers were insignificant and sprouted directly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bark; and for all I knew or could determine it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might, like the yaretta, belong to the celery family.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently, too, I realized that my right hand felt numb</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •The remarkable ant-plant of Java and the East Indies appears to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed by nature as a home for ants. The large tuber-like root is</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with natural passages and chambers very similar to those of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant's nest. Within these, certain species of ants always dwell and</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably are beneficial to the plant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and swollen, as if it had been stung or bitten by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisonous insect. Glancing at it, I was surprised to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was red, inflamed and puffed up. Yet I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain I had not been bitten by an ant and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally certain I had not been stung. Then the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawned upon me. It was the juice of the plant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No wonder the ants were free from molestation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dwelling within this plant, whose juices were so irri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatingly poisonous, they were perfectly safe. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy would venture within, and Nature had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">them immune to the poison, just as it provided them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with natural poison-filled nests wherein to dwell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was indeed fortunate for me that I had not at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to investigate the interior of the ants' natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelling place. The minute quantity of sap, juice or</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil which had exuded from the tiny incision I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made, had played havoc with my hand already. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelling rapidly; pains were shooting up my arm; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt feverish and ill. I was ignorant of the nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the poison. I did not know whether it was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">alkaloid, an oil or an acid, and even had I known, I „</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed no antidotes, no medicines of any sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To continue on our way was impossible. To remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">here would be worse. I realized I was in for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of severe illness and helplessness, if not death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we must reach some shelter, some spot where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be safe and where food could be obtained. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the cave, but that was far distant; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only be reached by a stiff climb, which I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not accomplish, and time was pressing. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought of the agricultural ants. Their colonies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">near, they were safe, there was food in abundance, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt sure we would be permitted to return and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main there. Telling Tom of my plan, we hurriedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">left and headed for the nearest ant-farm. Until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to walk I did not realize how badly off I was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how weak or how feverish. It was only by using my</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost will power, by forcing my muscles to act, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could set one foot before another. Tom was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety, solicitous of my welfare, and did everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to aid me. He almost carried me, and he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly spoke cheering words, vowing that, once he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to the ants' village, he would find "bush" with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to cure me. Had it not been for him, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have reached our goal; I would have dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my tracks, to die miserably and be devoured by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loathsome carrion-beetles. By the time we saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the agricultural-ants ahead of us, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">right side of my body was paralyzed; I could scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">see or hear, and I was hardly more than a moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpse. With amazing speed, Tom stretched my ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mock in the shade just within the wall, and dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it, I lost consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long I remained utterly dead to my surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings I shall never know. Tom was far too busily oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied trying to save my life to keep count of days or</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks. But he won. His intimate, almost uncanny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of tropical medicinal herbs was my salva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. When I opened my eyes and regained my senses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fever had left me, the swelling of hand and arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone down, and Tom assured me that all I needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rest and good food. Poor, faithful black Tom!</seg><seg type="columnLine">How he must have worked, worried and suffered!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing his terror of his surroundings, his fright</seg><seg type="columnLine">at every unusual thing, his fear even of the friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">agricultural-ants and his worry over me, I could partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciate the agonies of mind he must have undergone</seg><seg type="columnLine">while alone during my illness. And in all those end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">less days, I doubt if he ate one square meal or slept:</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours at a stretch. He did not dare to leave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hunt and secure game. He subsisted on raw wheat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and corn, for he was fearful of lighting a fire so near</seg><seg type="columnLine">486</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tlie ants. Only for the purpose of gathering his "bush"</seg><seg type="columnLine">did he leave my side for a moment. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even possess a utensil in which to brew the herbs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">roots, but was forced to pound and bruise them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">macerate them in cold water. The poor fellow was thin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn, haggard. He was so emaciated, he was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">living skeleton, but he was as cheerful as ever and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned delightedly from ear to ear, as he saw me</seg><seg type="columnLine">open my eyes and knew that he had won the battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first thing I did was to send him on a hunt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">declaring I was perfectly safe and that meat was needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much for his benefit as for mine.

Evidently to them we were a new kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of inquilines dependent upon their bounty.

There have been many remarkable oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">currences. I have made many marvelous dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveries, and we have had innumerable strange adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. In fact, nothing that the most fertile imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion could invent, nothing the wildest fiction could re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late, would begin to equal the reality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When last I wrote, I was recovering from the ill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness brought upon me by the poison of the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant-tree. During my convalescence I had thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">much upon our situation and our future, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that it was almost hopeless to expect to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place. I determined to make the best of things</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet, not to give up calmly. But I realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would undoubtedly be many months--perhaps years</seg><seg type="columnLine">--before we could find a means to escape, if ever we</seg><seg type="columnLine">did, and that if we were to live in anything approxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mating comfort and security, we must have a perma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent home or headquarters. The cave I have men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned was excellent,, in its way, but it had many dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantages, and having considered various locations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I decided that we could do no better than to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we were with the friendly agricultural-ants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here we were in the centre of things, so to speak..</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were safe from enemies, for none dared trespass</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the giant bumble-bees were ever on guard. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was abundant game within reach, and the ants' grain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">corn and honey were also available. Moreover, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become rather attached to the good-natured, hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">working, peaceful ants, whose hospitality had stood us</seg><seg type="columnLine">in such good stead. Thus have I decided, and Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed with me, for he, too, liked the ants and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer feared them. We started work on erecting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut to shelter us, for I felt sure that before long we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have rainy weather with torrential downpours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To erect a fairly comfortable shack is an easy matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tropics, and, although my strength had not fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned, I was quite able to perform much of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighter work, while Tom could gather the material and</seg><seg type="columnLine">do the heavier work. The hut, as we planned it, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be of the Indian type, an affair of bamboo, cane3</seg><seg type="columnLine">and small posts with the framework fastened together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bush rope of lianas (vines), and with a "shingled"</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof of palm leaves. I had helped to construct scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such shelters, and Tom was perfectly familiar with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their erection, for they are widely used by the West</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians. Very soon he had collected the material re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired and with my help, the corner-posts and frame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work were set up without any difficulty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we worked, the ants seemed greatly interested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but whether they were merely curious or whether they</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildly resented our taking possession of their land</seg><seg type="columnLine">and placing a house thereon, I could not feel sure. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the third day, when the shelter had begun to as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sume the form of a building, they became quite excited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They examined the hut from every side, climbed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and presently hurried off. Imagine my astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">487</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ment when, a short time later, they came trudging</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, each ant carrying a load of stick mud with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they immediately began plastering the shack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing I had seen had surprised me so greatly. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only had they recognized the structure as a house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they had decided to aid us and to complete our</seg><seg type="columnLine">shack in the manner which they considered proper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course it may have been nothing more than their</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct, their natural tendencies to construct mud</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings excited by seeing a framework suggestive of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a building. But I prefer to think that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">their almost human intelligence and their kindly, hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitable desire to aid us. At any rate, the work went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on apace, and in an incredibly short time we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves in possession of a mud-walled, snug home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">far more elaborate and solid than we had planned. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first I feared that our ant neighbors might carry mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters still farther and turn their attentions to the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior of the edifice. But either they thought that that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a matter for ourselves or else they reasoned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we had not elected to use their cell-lined buildings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such things were not adapted to us. But if they very</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisely refrained from furnishing our home with tiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pigeon-hole-like cells, they were not yet through with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. No sooner had they completed plastering the hut</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their satisfaction than they began bringing corn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grain and storing it within the shack. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to fear that they had mistaken our purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had assumed that we were building a storehouse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that they would fill it to overflowing and force us</seg><seg type="columnLine">either to sleep in the open or to erect a second dwell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Enough was as good as a feast, and not knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to induce them to cease provisioning our new</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, I decided to try a gentle hint and slung our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammocks within the dwelling. This had the desired</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect, and at last the helpful ants withdrew and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in sole and undisputed possession of our own home</seg><seg type="columnLine">and supplies. It was very evident, however, that to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their minds we were helpless creatures, true inquilines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who must be humored and cared for. Daily they</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought us food, and I was highly amused when one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the creatures appeared lugging in a huge squirm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing larva and deposited it beside Tom, evidently think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that all meat was alike to us. Indeed, it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant puzzle to the ants as to why we should devour</seg><seg type="columnLine">some forms of animal life and not others, and, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">daily, they brought offerings of dead or living insects.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the big Carib-beetles had taken up his abode</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us, and although his overpowering odor was most</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasant and he was far from welcome on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">account, we permitted him to remain. Needless to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, we found a ready means of disposing of the well</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant but superfluous offerings, by feeding them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ever-hungry beetle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time I had fully recovered my strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt able to go about and take long walks, we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become thoroughly accustomed to dwelling among these</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants. We had even grown to distinguish individuals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first they all looked precisely alike. Now, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we realized that there were slight differences. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have a slightly malformed antenna or foot; an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other would be a shade lighter or darker on abdomen</seg><seg type="columnLine">than thorax or vice-versa; another would possess tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">warts or pimples, and so on indefinitely. To amuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves, we had given many of them nicknames. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a Tom, a Bill, a Jerry, a Pat, a Daddy Long-Legs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Fatty, a Skinny and many others, while one unusu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally dark colored individual, who was particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">assiduous in its attentions, had been dubbed "Nigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">Baby" by Tom. Moreover, the swarming or emergence</seg><seg type="columnLine">season was over for the year, and there was no change</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the personnel of the colony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1HAD also learned much about the family and social</seg><seg type="columnLine">life of these strange ants. Among other things I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discovered that we were not the only inquilines</seg><seg type="columnLine">by any means. Within their multitudinous chambers</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had come upon a regular entomological collection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these easy-going, lazy, self-appointed guests. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were moths, caterpillars, beetles, flies, hemiptera, neu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roptera, hymenoptera and even snails. I learned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the larvse of the Carib-beetles were inquilines, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the big bumble-bees had their homes in the ants'</seg><seg type="columnLine">burrows, reminding me of the burrowing owls who</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwell with the prairie-dogs, and I came to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion that it was this close association, rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">true domestication, which had led to the savage beetles'</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ferocious bees' positions among the ants. But by</seg><seg type="columnLine">far the most surprising and interesting of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiline were other ants. I had never heard or</seg><seg type="columnLine">known of ants maintaining other ants as inquilines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I considered I had made a truly remarkable ento-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mological discovery. These ant-inquilines were a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct species and genus, and in many ways more</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely resembled termites than true ants.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Gustatory organs of the honey ant (Face viewed from beneath)--nk--</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, fm--Foramen, lb--labium, mx--maxilla, mxp--maxillary palp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to--tongue, Ib.p^--labial palp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">From "Ant Communities." by Henry C.

But they possessed a most remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able habit of burrowing or digging. They were liter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally born miners, and whenever one of the creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">was placed on soft earth or found itself in a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot, it would instantly commence digging like mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it had completely vanished within its new bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row.

But soon I solved this</seg><seg type="columnLine">riddle, and in so doing was more than ever impressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and amazed at the unfathomable ways of Nature. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of the chambers I had noticed great globular</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects hanging from the roofs. At first I took them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the nests of some inquiline, some wasp, or hornet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I rather avoided going too near them. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite by accident, I bumped my head against one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the objects, and as I drew hastily back, expecting an</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry hornet to emerge and resent my actions, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished to see the thing move slowly along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling. In the dim light it had a most remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect, and approaching closely, I discovered that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was alive. The globular mass was the enorm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously distended and swollen abdomen of an ant. vSo</seg><seg type="columnLine">large was the abdomen in proportion to the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insect that its head, thorax and feet were almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible, and the three-foot body appeared suspended</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a stem, like a gigantic apple, rather than supported</seg><seg type="columnLine">by legs and feet. The contact with my head had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed the weird creature, and from tiny orifices be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the widely separated and stretched segments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the abdomen, a thick fluid with a sickly-sweetish odor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exuding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no question as to its identity. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those strange honey-ants; those remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects who, fed and waited upon by its fellows, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes filled with a peculiar matter resembling honey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until, so distended that it is practically helpless, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">becomes a living honey-pot and provides a source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food for its more active companions.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To have found a colony of honey-ants, even of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense size, would not have surprised me greatly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But to find such honey-ants in the home of the agri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultural-ants, was most remarkable. That it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a member of these I felt positive, and I came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion that it, too, was an inquiline and that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">return for its bed and board, it provided the agricul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tural ants with its syrupy secretion. But I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">destined to make an even more surprising discovery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I 'was examining the creature and its fellows, sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral of the blind, white digger-ants came into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber, and climbing up the walls, made their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">unerringly to the honey-ants and proceeded to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to the contents of the latters' abdomens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This then was the food of these pale-bodied, sight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less creatures. Inquilines themselves, they were pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided with food by other inquilines, who in turn were</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained by the rightful denizens of the place. Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, was a matter for entomologists to puzzle over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for evolutionists to explain. Had the honey-ants been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first inquilines and had the blind diggers taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage of their presence? Had the reverse been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case, and had the agricultural-ants introduced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honey-containers to feed their other inquilines? Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it all a matter of evolution, of Nature creating</seg><seg type="columnLine">or developing one insect to support another? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what did it all mean? Of what benefit were the pale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickly looking burrowing ants to the agricultural-ants;</seg><seg type="columnLine">what purpose did the honey-ants sei-ve as far as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agricultural-ants were concerned? And why should the</seg><seg type="columnLine">industrious, busy, intelligent agriculturalists support</seg><seg type="columnLine">these lazy, apparently useless inquilines within their</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes? Personally I could find no answer, but I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that somewhere, in some manner, the owners of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•Many species of ants arc prized by the natives as delicacies. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">queens of the biff drougher (leaf-carrying) 'ants of tropical America arc</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly hunted and eaten by the Indians. The queens' bodies are enor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mously distended with eggs and have a sweet, rich flavor, much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">condcnscd milk. The true honey-ants are very different. Certain mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of the colonics of these ants remain quiescent and are fed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorged by their fellows. Their abdomens swell to huge size and become</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with a peculiar honey-like material which provides food for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other members of the colonies. They are, in effect, living honey-pots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">burrows must benefit by the presence of these and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other inquilines, and that the whole involved affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be the result of a purposeful scheme of an all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise Creator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I have hitherto spoken of the agricultural ants as</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly, peaceful creatures, but by this I do not mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were inoffensive or cowardly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the contrary, I found them most valiant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">courageous when necessity arose and, once their temper</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fighting spirit were aroused, they became possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an almost insane fury. The first occasion on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I discovered this trait was a few days after I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to be about. I had taken a short walk along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roadway leading from one colony to another, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was perhaps a mile from our shack, when my atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was attracted by thrashing, crackling sounds is-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suing from a thicket near the path. Cautiously, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no desire to walk blindly into danger, I approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot. Beyond the thicket was a small open space</seg><seg type="columnLine">and within this two creatures were engaged in a ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific duel to the death. So rapid were their move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, that for a moment I could not be sure of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">identities, except that they were ants. But as for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant they drew apart and awaited another op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity to rush at each other, I saw that one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a member of the agricultural-ants' community, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other was an enormous red warrior with huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible jaws, overgrown head and powerful legs. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of a species I had not before seen, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was one of the fighting or soldier caste and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary worker was obvious. As he stood there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reared on his hind legs, his big head thrust forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his terrible jaws opened threateningly, he reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">me of the pictures of old Roman gladiators. And if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">represented the helmeted, sword-armed gladiator then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might say, the other represented the "fisherman"</seg><seg type="columnLine">gladiator with net and trident. That the latter stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">any sort of a chance against his powerful fighting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine foe seemed unworthy of consideration, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment I was tempted to come to our friend's</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid by firing a pistol bullet into the warrior facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. But I was rather anxious to witness the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come of the fray and decided to withhold my inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference until I saw that the agricultural-ant was get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting the worst of it. The next second they rushed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The big warrior fairly hurled himself forward, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">held my breath, my nerves atingle with excitement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">expecting to see our champion thrown, mortally</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded, to the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But what the farmer lacked in brute strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">power was made up for by his superior intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and agility. Lowering his head, he dashed in like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash, and, like a football player, tackled his enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. The very impetuosity of the other's rush was</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him. He stumbled over his adversary, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great jaws clashed murderously but harmlessly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he sprawled headlong on the earth, I saw that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend had severed one of the soldier's legs as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed beneath him. But the warrior was not crippled</seg><seg type="columnLine">or out of the fight by any means. Before the agri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultural-ant could turn, he was on his feet, and mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rage, was rushing at the other. One nip with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those giant jaws and all would be over. But with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick side leap, our friend escaped the other's vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">side-swiping mandibles and, wheeling like a flash, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew at his enemy's rear, and snapping right and left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore great pieces from his foe's abdomen before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter could turn. However, things were not going</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely in his favor. The other swung about, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agricultural-ant before he could escape or dodge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for a moment the two were a whirling, writhing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">confused mass of swinging legs, snapping jaws and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">489</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">armored bodies. The next instant they had broken	agricultural-ants, for I not only had my natural curi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from the clinch and I saw that our neighbor had lost	osity to appease but somehow, by some intuition or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">two legs and an antennae, and had several ugly gashes	perhaps merely because of the stranger's appearance, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as a result of the mix-up. But his injuries seemed	felt that in him and his kind, lay a most deadly and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">only to increase his anger and his ferocity.

In such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spot there might be a chance of climbing out as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as the next dry season came on, and the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished. By now, I had forgotten to note, the wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">season was evidently near at hand, as I had suspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be. Although no heavy rains had fallen, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had a few showers; the summits of the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains half way to their bases were hidden in clouds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from the increased flow of the streams and {he</seg><seg type="columnLine">innumerable trickling rills on the mountain sides,' I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that heavy rains must be falling on the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain tops, and probably on the country beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ants, too, were preparing for the rainy season.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had harvested all their crops, had worked over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soil and had planted their seeds and young plants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Constantly, too, they were adding to the plastering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of walls and buildings, and a small army of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures was busily engaged in digging trenches</seg><seg type="columnLine">about their fields, evidently designed to carry off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surplus water when the torrential rains arrived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our route that day was new, and as we walked along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversing a pleasant rolling district covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense forest and cut by many streams, I noticed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insect life had altered greatly with the advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the seasons. Butterflies and moths were very scarce;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no caterpillars seen, but we noticed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerable cocoons and chrysalids attached to trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs and bushes. Some of the former were composed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such delicate, thin, tough silk that we determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to secure them 011 our return, for they would serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellently for blankets and for garments. We would</seg><seg type="columnLine">very soon be in dire need of clothing, and I had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">given considerable thought to the problem of making</seg><seg type="columnLine">new wearing apparel to replace our worn and tattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">rags. I had thought of many things, but here, ready-</seg><seg type="columnLine">made for us, was tough, strong cloth which only needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be cut and sewed into form to provide excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bees and hornets were also scarce; the few beetles</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw were arboreal species; but flies, gnats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">neuroptera swarmed, while by far the most abundant</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects belonged to the ortlioptera, a family which on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our previous trips had not appeared numerous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crickets and grasshoppers were everywhere; Katydid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like insects filled the forest with their strident notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tree-tops, and woodland cockroaches scuttled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the earth and dodged into hiding places on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark of the trees. In one spot Tom came to a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den halt and his eyes grew wide with wonder. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could scarcely blame him. In a small opening ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us a shaft of sunlight cast a subdued golden-green</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and dancing about in this were a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings, who might well have been fairies. So fairy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like were their pale, semi-transparent, graceful bodies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their gauzy iridescent wings and their flowing draper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies, that even the most prosaic and non-imaginative per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son might have been converted to a firm belief in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence of woodland sprites. Silently as wraiths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they circled and floated in the golden haze, their move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments orderly and rhythmic, their motions graceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">and following a well defined system, and 33 ephemeral</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unreal as a fragment of gossamer rainbow. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time we watched them, fascinated and charmed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their supernatural beauty and phantasmal dance, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom found it difficult to believe me when I assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">him they were no fairies, but merely a species of</seg><seg type="columnLine">May-fly enjoying their nuptial festivities during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few short hours, which nature had allotted them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">their span of life. Poor, happy, care-free, beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">things! An hour before they had been ugly, crawling</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquatic larva;. Before the day was done they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lying lifeless and forgotten upon the forest floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet, to them, their lives probably seemed as long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as filled with adventure, love, sorrow, joy and expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riences as our lives seem to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was after we had left the dancing fairy-like crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, and my mind was occupied with thoughts on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysteries of life and nature, that in approaching a</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly fallen tree trunk an apparent mass of dead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dried leaves suddenly sprang into life and fluttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">off on dull-orange and purple wings. Tom promptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapsed and sat staring incredulously. "Lordy!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ejaculated. "Ah boun' say.

No, sir, Ah-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS if to test his statement and to bear out his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectations, a limb of the tree suddenly came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, and raising itself on legs, and rearing up a long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck topped with goggle eyes, it peered searchingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Tom's face. The sudden transformation of ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent dead leaves into butterflies had been surprising</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to Tom, although I had recognized them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a species closely related to the tropical Kalimas, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">most remarkably camouflaged of all protectively-colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">butterflies or lepidoptera-.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to be taken at his word and to see a rough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark-covered limb of the tree come to life before his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, was too much for Tom. He was too astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move, too amazed even to be frightened. He sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, eyes staring and rolling, wide lips parted, jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagging. And, had such a thing been possible, I verily</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe his kinky wool would have stood on end. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an astounding thing to see leaves become butter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies, but once they had become animated, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously and unmistakably butterflies. But the limb,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although indisputably alive, was still, to all intents and</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearances, a tree branch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the same color, it was covered with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">mottled, lichen-dotted bark, slender twigs took the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of legs, a small warty knob formed the head, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave serious-looking eyes seemed nothing more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperfections on the end of a twig. Having apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied itself that Tom was harmless, or perhaps as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured that the negro's boast was not to be taken seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, the animated limb moved slowly, deliberately</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the trunk for a few yards, halted, raised itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an angle, and instantly became transformed into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb indistinguishable from those about it. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">convulsed with laughter at Tom's expression. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an incredible, an impossible thing to him; something</seg><seg type="columnLine">supernatural and savoring of witchcraft was taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. But after my first momentary surprise at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great size of the apparition, it seemed perfectly natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my eyes. It was, as I knew, merely one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, almost weird orthoptera, commonly known as</seg><seg type="columnLine">"walking-sticks" or "stick-insects," which have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed and fashioned by nature to exactly imitate</seg><seg type="columnLine">a twig or branch for their self-protection. They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">among our commonest woodland insects in the north,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  •Many common butterflies simulate leaves when at rest. The moet</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable case of protective coloration, as it is called, among butterflies</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the Kalima. The under surfaces of the wings are colored and veined</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a dead leaf and are of the same shape when folded. When at rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kalima assumes the exact position and location of a leaf upon a twig</seg><seg type="columnLine">and is almost ^distinguishable from the true leaves about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">491</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">especially in late summer and autumn, and they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly abundant in the tropics. Our own species reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">a length of six inches or more; I had seen and collected</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens over a foot in length in the tropics, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">here was a giant at least twelve feet long. I tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain the matter to Tom, but until I approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmless creature and prodded it with a stick, forcing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to come to life again, he refused to believe it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely a curiosity of the insect-world. I wondered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as at last we left the giant walking-stick to itself, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">these big fellows went through the same seasonal</seg><seg type="columnLine">transitions as their small northern cousins. I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if they were green and soft in the spring; if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they simulated the luxuriantly growing and budding</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches during the summer, and if they turned russet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yellow and ended their lives by dropping earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward with the falling leaves in the autumn, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northern species do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, I was somewhat surprised that we had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come upon any representatives of those even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable and astonishingly-protected creatures, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"walking-leaves" or "leaf-inseets." They are mainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropical and are noted for the exactitude with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veins of their wings, the foliate legs, and the mark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings upon them, match the leaves among which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. No doubt, we had passed near many of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">without discovering their presence; but thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them did not make me any easier in my mind. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are carnivorous creatures, very savage and bloodthirsty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if they grew to the gigantic proportions one might</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonably expect in this place, they might prove far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from harmless.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not at all relish the idea of being suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounced upon by a hungry leaf-insect or mantis several</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards in length, and I kept a sharp watch for sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picious-looking clusters of leaves as we proceeded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So intent was I on avoiding possible attacks from</seg><seg type="columnLine">such sources that we very nearly came to grief. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were passing under some unusually large trees draped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with tangled lianas and gigantic air-plants, when Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffed audibly. "Mus' be a mighty sweet flower 'roun'</seg><seg type="columnLine">'bout," he remarked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I also noticed the almost sickish sweetness in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air now that he mentioned it. But overpoweringly sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">odors from blossoms are so common in the tropical</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests that I gave little heed to it. The next moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom gave a yell like a Comanche and almost bowled</seg><seg type="columnLine">me over as he dashed from behind the tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wa la!" he exclaimed, "Tha' mos' surely been obeah</seg><seg type="columnLine">'bout here. Ah been went for pick tha' flower an' he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to snake an' try for nip me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Laughing at Tom's fears, and supposing that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come upon some other protectively-colored insect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stepped around the tree. Covering a fleshy-leaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">vine depending from the tree-top, were clusters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange blossoms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In color they were dull purple and russet with</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden-yellow striping, and the sweet odor emanating</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them was cloying in its heavy, sickish perfume.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In form the flowers suggested orchids; and the stems</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaves of the vine were very similar to those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gigantic vantilla vine. Tom, maintaining a safe dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance in my rear and ready to turn and run at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant's notice, repeated his assertion, that, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had attempted to secure one of the flowers, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into a serpent and had struck viciously at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Such a thing I knew was impossible, even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this land of many surprises, but I felt that there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •In Borneo a species of Mantis is colored and formed to exactly imi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate the flower of a handsome orchid.

But despite my most painstaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny of the vine and its odorous flowers, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">detect no signs of animal life. Telling Tom to indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate which flower he had approached, I extended my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bill-hook spear until the point touched the blossom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly, from behind the petals, five long, green ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacles shot out and entwined themselves about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spear. Thunderstruck at this phenomenon, I attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to withdraw my weapon only to find it held irresistibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">by those clinging tentacles. With all my strength I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tugged and wrenched, but my efforts were futile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly the tentacles contracted and the spear was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn towards the centre of the flower, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">petals folded inwards, closing like the segments of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange-peel dredge-bucket. Then, as the tip of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon touched the surface of the blossom, the petals</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew back, the green tentacles released their grasp, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sprawled backward, overbalanced by the sudden free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the spear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was Tom's turn to laugh, and he took full ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of the opportunity. I certainly could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame him for having been frightened and for having</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaken the tentacles for snakes. And while I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the tentacles were vegetable and not animal, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fully aware of the narrow escape Tom had had.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If those powerful tendrils had seized him, there would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been no escape, for there was no doubt that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant was carnivorous, that it was as relentlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodthirsty and savage as any wild beast, and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet, beautiful blooms were designed to lead unsus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecting creatures to their destruction.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whole thing was a marvelously designed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfected trap. Any object touching or approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flowers was instantly seized by the concealed ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drils coiled behind the handsome petals, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn to the flower's centre and enfolded by the petals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, if the capture was a living, creature, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">digested and devoured by the plant, or if inedible, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the case of my spear, it was cast aside. Even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we watched, a huge green-bodied fly flew towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clustering flowers and alighted on the velvety-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">petals. The next instant he was buzzing and strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling helplessly in the grasp of the tendrils and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being drawn towards the centre of the blossom that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had attracted him. A moment more and the flower had</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed and the unfortunate insect had been added</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the list of the plant's victims.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a fly, even a giant two feet in length, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely more than a morsel for the plant, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">as greedily seized and eaten as a peanut by an ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unquestionably the normal food of the strange vine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was insects, for there were no other forms of animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, except the gigantic lizards and an occasional tree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frog, which could fall into its trap. But its tendrils</seg><seg type="columnLine">were strong and powerful enough to capture and hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man, and as I looked more closely at the flowers, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that the inner surfaces of the petals were .cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with sharp, barbed thorns which would anchor</seg><seg type="columnLine">a body immovably, once the petals had closed over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •Many plants are carnivorous.

It was certainly the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most encouraging prospect we had yet found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our return to the ant-colony was also without inci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent, except for one discovery which at the time seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of little importance. In one spot we came upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great pile of rotting leaves and vegetation, evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">of artificial construction. Upon investigation, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved to be a nest or breeding place of those strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombardier-beetles, one of which we had seen destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant solitary-ant which had attacked us. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">adults were present, for which I was grateful, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compost pile was alive with the immature larva.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One other discovery I made, which was most im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant to me but has little if any scientific interest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My tobacco had been exhausted for some time and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this trip I found an excellent substitute. This was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner bark of a tree, which I take to be closely re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated to or identical with the Kipa tree, whose bark</seg><seg type="columnLine">is so widely used in place of tobacco by many tribes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of South American Indians. It was the similarity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tree to the Kipa that first attracted my atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and a trial pipe-full of the shredded, papery bark</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved that it was fully the equal of the Kipa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hence, although our journey was without definite re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult, from the point of view of escaping, still it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not fruitless, and I felt well repaid for the day's</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was several days after our expedition to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cataract that we had a most terrifying adventure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a most narrow escape from an awful fate. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned southward and were following the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a good-sized stream, when, stopping to rest for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few moments in a rather dense patch of forest, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed an unusual number of insects. Even during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the height of the dry season I never saw so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects at one time during the day. But now myriads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flying, crawling, hopping, running and creeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were all about us. A few late butterflies flitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">erratically past on frayed wings. Great green tree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crickets whirred through the air, alighting momentarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">to again spread their stiff wings and continue on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Huge brown cockroaches blundered about. Bees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies buzzed and hummed. Beetles scurried over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Crickets and grass hoppers traveled by huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaps. An ugly looking praying-mantis, with his lobster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like claws raised and clasped as if in supplication,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurried by and paid no heed to the abundant insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. And, as if in chase of the myriad insects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet paying no attention to their proximity, several</seg><seg type="columnLine">big warty toads and a couple of tree-frogs hopped pon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derously past us. Once or twice, also, we caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpses of fleeing hares and marmots, and then, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rush and roar of a charging rhinoceros, a gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinosaur-like iguana tore through the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was as if the entire population of the place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the move; as if every form of life was migrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">in unison; and, unable to account for the exodus, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that all were headed in the same direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow it reminded me of a picture in the geography</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my schooldays, a picture supposed to represent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie fire with the herds of wild horses, antelopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other creatures fleeing from the onrushing flames.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But there was no fire in the forest near us, no con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flagration of any sort to drive the denizens of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest en masse before it. Fire, I felt sure, had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">existed until our arrival, and even had it been pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible that by accident we had set fire to the forest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no smell of smoke, nothing to indicate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">conflagration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet here were countless creatures all hurrying from</seg><seg type="columnLine">something and obviously terrified and seeking only</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own safety, for the most ferociously carnivorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and predatory species moved side by side with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural prey, and made no effort to molest them. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants were numbered in the throng, and to my amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment I saw one of the giant solitary fellows hurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">past, all his savagery gone in his fear of some un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known danger! So numerous were the creatures, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attempt to move on our way was impossible, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by flattening ourselves against a tree-trunk could</seg><seg type="columnLine">we escape being overrun by the onrushing hordes. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps ten minutes this continued. Then the numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the creatures sensibly diminished; only the slower</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving species continued to pass us,' and as the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">stragglers and cripples struggled along, I was conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a strange, rapidly increasing sound from the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion whence the hordes of creatures had come. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roaring, swishing noise, more like the sound of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scending rain upon a roof than anything else, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment I thought it was caused by a torrential</seg><seg type="columnLine">downpour upon the forest and that the deluge was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause of the creatures' flight. But the sky was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still bright; there was no feel of rain in the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For perhaps ten seconds I stood irresolute, unde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided whether to advance or to follow the example of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the affrighted creatures and retreat. Then suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrible premonition, an awful fear swept over me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shouting to Tom to follow, I sprang forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed headlong after the fleeing insects. But too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late. Hardly had we covered fifty yards when I leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with a warning yell. Before me, like a flowing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">living stream, was a vast column of gigantic ants. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst fears were realized. Army-ants were on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">march. No wonder the wild denizens of the forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fled in mad terror. Too late I had realized what</seg><seg type="columnLine">that roaring sound presaged. Thousands, millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voracious ants were marching through the forest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">devouring every living thing in their way, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country over which they had passed absolutely de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">void of life. If ever we were caught by them, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be beyond all hope and only our clean-picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones would remain when the army had passed on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turning, hoping yet to outdistance the advancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">493</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As he stood there, reared on his hind legs, his big head thrust forward and his terrible jaws opened threateningly, ho reminded mo ol on old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Roman gladiator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hordes of terrible creatures, I turned and raced in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite direction, with Tom at my side. Ten, twenty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty yards we covered and then, converging upon us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the other far-flung wing of the ant army. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were surrounded, hemmed in. To try to break through</seg><seg type="columnLine">that cordon of five-foot creatures, creatures as large</seg><seg type="columnLine">as wolves, a hundred times more ravenous, a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">times more fearless, more powerful and more immune</seg><seg type="columnLine">to injuries or attack, was suicidal. And now, apallingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">close at hand, we could hear the sounds of countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of advancing bodies, the ceaseless clashing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless millions of terrible jaws blending into a uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form swishing roar. Yelling orders at the top of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs, resorting to our last hope, I franctically gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered leaves and twigs, while Tom, terrified beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech, but mechanically obeying, did the same. Piling</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in a heap, I touched match to them with shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and praying as I had never before prayed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaves might ignite, that fire and smoke might yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">save our lives. Never had leaves seemed so loth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take fire. Shaking until my teeth chattered, I held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickering match, while close upon me I heard the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the advancing ants. By the time the leaves ignited</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the flames darted up, the foremost ants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a dozen paces. Blind as they were, depending</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly upon the senses of smell and hearing, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful creatures turned towards us unerringly. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the pungent, reeking smoke reached them, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted. And as though at a spoken word of command,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole vast army in their rear came instantly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. It was a brief respite, and madly we availed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves of the few short seconds. Regardless of</seg><seg type="columnLine">burns, scarcely sensible of the heat and pain, we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped handfuls of the blazing leaves and twigs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled them towards the ants. Some of the creatures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorched and half-suifocated, squirmed and twisted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony; others hurried in a frenzy'to one side, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulk moved deliberately, as with one accord, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few paces backward. By now the fire had spread, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about us the forest floor was smouldering, burning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending up a dense choking smoke and breaking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">little spurts of flame where the leaves were thicker or</seg><seg type="columnLine">drier than elsewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">npHE army was checked; even the fearless, irresist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A ible ants dared not cross that hot smoking area.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we had no time to lose. In a few moments the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin layer of leaves, the few dry twigs would be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed, and once again the ants would be upon us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turning, we dashed forward. If we had delayed five</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds we would have been irretrievably lost. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main army had been checked, though our fire had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown back the curving, crescent-like vanguard or</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirmishers, the leaders of that marvelously organized</seg><seg type="columnLine">army had not been out-generalled by our defense. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side of the main body flanking parties had rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly advanced, and now, as we rushed onward, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hurrying at incredible speed to cut off our re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treat. Less than twenty feet separated the two con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verging columns, and as we dashed for this narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, panting, almost insane with terror, three of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great warriors scurried forward to intercept us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At point-blank range I fired two bullets through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of one. With all my strength, I swung my taran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tula-jaw bill-hook at the second, and I saw Tom lop</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head from the third with his weapon. Before us</seg><seg type="columnLine">494</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the way was clear. Behind us came the ants in full</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry. Though far slower in movement than the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants we had met, yet they were steadily gaining on</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Our mad pace could not last for long. We seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed to destruction when, ahead, we saw the gleam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water. Without hesitation, forgetting the perils</seg><seg type="columnLine">of possible aquatic beasts as dangerous as the ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we plunged into the stream and with our last remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing strength, struck out for the further shore. Draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ourselves upon the bank, we lay helpless, gasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">for breath, while the baffled ants, reaching the brink</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stream, moved rapidly up and down, searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">vainly for a spot to cross. I felt certain we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe, at least for a time. The river was far too wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">for even the army ants to bridge. But for all I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, there might be a narrow or a shallow ^pot</seg><seg type="columnLine">further up or down the stream, or a fallen tree might</seg><seg type="columnLine">partially bridge it. It would be more than reckless to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain long where we were. But we could not pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceed until we had recovered somewhat from our stren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uous exertions, and as we strove to calm our palpi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tating hearts and to regain control of our lungs, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched, fascinated, our enemy ants, separated by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scant one hundred feet from where we sat. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">perseverance, their organization, their ingenuity were</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost uncanny.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again and again they attempted to cross the stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of living bridges. Several of the ants would</seg><seg type="columnLine">select a firm spot on the bank, and holding to roots</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bushes with their tremendous jaws, would allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies to swing suspended in the air. Others</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rapidly clamber down these, and grasping their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows by their jaws, would extend the living chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their own length. Over these would hurry others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until link by link, the bodies of the ants extended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chain sufficiently to reach from shore to shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, the last ants releasing their hold of the bank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the living bridge would swing free and would be swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward and towards our side by the current.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several times we fairly trembled and were ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise and dash off as the ultimate links of the ant-chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed about to lodge against the bank where we sat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But each time the current proved too swift, the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge failed to make connections, and the ingenious</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants were carried past us and were forced to scramble</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to safety on their own side of the river. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that ultimately they would succeed, and that sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">or later a bridge would be formed, and that over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended bodies of their fellows the whole vast army</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come swarming to our side. I had exhausted my</seg><seg type="columnLine">final cartridge; both Tom and myself lost our price-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less weapons when we threw them aside to swim the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. But even unarmed and defenceless, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">better to face the dangers of the forests and jungles</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to remain so dangerously close to the ant army.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last, our breaths and strength partly restored, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose and hurried with all possible speed upstream and</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards a distant spot where we could cross the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">just above a branch which would effectively prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army ants from reaching us. Fortunately for us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we met no dangerous creatures on our way. The en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire district appeared to be devoid of life and I decided</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  •The organization and discipline of the common army ants, such a9</seg><seg type="columnLine">we encountered, are almost incredible. Although blind, these ants move</seg><seg type="columnLine">in regular columns, send out scouts, maintain a commissary and hospital</seg><seg type="columnLine">corps, build bridges and manoeuver with military precision and order.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Members of the army that are injured are placed at one side and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined by the ants detailed for the purpose. If too badly injured to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover, they are destroyed whereas, if only slightly wounded, they arc car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried to the rear and cared for until ablo to resume their places. Broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">or injured legs arc often amputated. When reaching streams or fissures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineering corps hurry forward and form living bridges over which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army passes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that every living creature had sensed the oncoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">army and had hurried away for safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spent and weary, we reached the walled-in lands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agricultural-ants at last, and never have I seen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">more welcome sight than the little group of mud</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings, our humble shack, and the good-natured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceful ants among whom we had found refuge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tT rained quite heavily a day or two later, and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">J- day the rains became heavier and of longer dura-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but at no time during the wet season was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much precipitation or such prolonged rains as in</seg><seg type="columnLine">other portions of the tropics with which I was familiar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless, time hung rather heavily on our hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for we were more or less confined to our shack and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was hopeless to try to do any serious exploration</seg><seg type="columnLine">work in search of an exit through the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To while away our time, we busied ourselves with</seg><seg type="columnLine">many matters. We made a number of new and better</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows than those we possessed, and we made several</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears. We also gathered a quantity of the silkiest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toughest cocoons and managed to make ourselves some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly serviceable garments. They were, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most ludicrous and crude, for our only cutting instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was my knife, and we had neither thread nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">needles. But by means of bone awl3 and the fibres</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cocoons, ravelled out and twisted together for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread, we succeeded fairly well. The clothing consisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">of baggy gaucho-like trousers which were little more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than bifurcated bags, and short ponchos in place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirts. Ponchos, of course, were the simplest things</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make, for they were nothing more than squares of</seg><seg type="columnLine">material with a slit in the centre. They were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">serviceable, however, and as we discovered that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer covering of the cocoons was impervious to water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they served us excellently as raincoats too. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become so friendly with the ants and so accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, that I jokingly slipped a poncho over one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creatures. It was a most amusing sight to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big ant wearing this typically Indian garment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for a few moments he seemed rather proud of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it evidently was more of an impediment than an</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage, and he soon stripped it off. .The ants were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, vastly interested in everything we did, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we constantly had an attentive audience watching our</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation and task. Personally, I devoted an immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of time trying to establish some means of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication with our hosts. But I am convinced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they either communicate among themselves by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vibratory waves emanating from and received by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their antennae, or else by a means akin to mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">telepathy. I did, however, make some progress. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeatedly making use of precisely the same gestures</seg><seg type="columnLine">or signs when I did anything, required anything or</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to communicate any thought, I established a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of sign language. It was truly remarkable to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">how quickly the ants grasped the idea. In a very short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time they had learned to recognize my sign for food,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as soon as I made it, they would rush off and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn with corn or grain. From this it was but a step</seg><seg type="columnLine">to teach them one sign for corn and the other for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the threshed grain, and in a month I had accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonders in the way of this primitive means of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is during this time, also, that Tom first started</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping pets. He has captured a young specimen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hare-like marsupial and it soon became very tame</seg><seg type="columnLine">and amused us both with its antics and its frolicksome</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways. One of the porcupine-like creatures followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon afterwards two marmots were added to the col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lection, and one day Tom returned from his traps with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a most remarkable creature, which, as nearly as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">495</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could identify it, was closely related to the Solendons*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having exhausted the mammalian inhabitants of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">region I suggested to Tom that we try our hands at</seg><seg type="columnLine">domesticating insects. At first Tom could not see any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing at all attractive or interesting in the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">making pets of the giant "bugs," as he still called</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. But I pointed out the success of the ants in</seg><seg type="columnLine">domesticating beetles and bees, and, half humorously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested that with a body-guard of tame hornets or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other dangerous insects, we would have no fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies. Tom took this quite seriously and he spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time considering whether he would start with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a young hornet or an immature solitary ant. He plied</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with innumerable questions regarding their habits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their food and where he would be likely to find a nest</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he could safely rob of the young. In fpct, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared quite disappointed when I told him that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a rather dangerous matter to attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">raid a solitary ant's nest, and that a young hornet</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a most uninteresting and helpless grub. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussion had given me an idea, and I recalled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bombardier-beetles' nest we had found and suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we visit it, and, if it contained young, secure</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them and try to domesticate them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOT only was I curious to learn more of the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, but, if it were possible to domesticate</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, they would prove far better guardians than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most ferocious of dogs. By good fortune, we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heap of fermenting material contained a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beetles in the pupal stage; quite capable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement and feeding, and yet soft-bodied, harmless</seg><seg type="columnLine">things and with their gas-glands and explosive ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus still undeveloped. Four of these we carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to our home and installed in a compartment by</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves. They grew very rapidly, and, to my sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise, I discovered that they were vegetable eaters in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their immature stage, although carnivorous when fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown. They also appeared amenable to domestica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and I began to have high hopes that we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find them very similar in their characters to our com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon skunks in the States. These odorous beasts are</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily tamed and never make use of their natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of defense when with their masters or friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but are quick to recognize enemies or strangers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make themselves both felt and smelt. Needless to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say our miniature menagerie was a vast source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity and interest to the ants. Undoubtedly, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded our pets as our natural inquilines, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly amused when one of them brought us several</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens of the honey-ants with one of the big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellied females, evidently thinking they were an essen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial portion of any real inquiline colony. But when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we established our nursery of bombardier-beetles, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants grew wildly excited. In them, of course, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized traditional enemies, and I could well imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feelings in the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To them it must have been much the same as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be for a guest in a hotel to start rearing rattle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">snakes or cobras in his suite. No doubt, had they</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to communicate with us, they would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered us either to rid ourselves of these newest pets</seg><seg type="columnLine">or else betake ourselves elsewhere. But as it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they merely showed their displeasure by giving us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold shoulder for several weeks. Gradually, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their curiosity overcame their fears or their dislike</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  •The Solcndon is a most interesting and remarkable mammal, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">combines characteristics of the rodents and the inscctivorac. As far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, they arc represented by only two species, one inhabiting Cuba,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other Santo Domingo. In many ways they more closely resemble ter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain fossil creatures of the Pleistocene period than any living creatures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is about fifteen inches in IcngUi with short neck, long trunk-like nose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat-like tail, front feet like a mole, extremely weak eyes and keen ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and covered with a combination of hair, wool and scales showing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete evolution from skin to true hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and, finding that the creatures appeared to be harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, they soon became as friendly as ever, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoning that bombardier-beetles in captivity were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more like their natural wild fellows than were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carib-beetles or giant bees. At first, also, we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been much afraid that these guardians of the colony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and especially the Carib-beetles, would fall upon our</seg><seg type="columnLine">pets and destroy and devour them. But we soon found</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had nothing to fear on that score. The big ferocious</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetles were as well trained to differentiate between</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend and foe as any watchdog at home. And like</seg><seg type="columnLine">our dogs, they appeared to distinguish instinctively be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween living creatures to be attacked and those to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">left unmolested. Many a dog will live in perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">amity with cats belonging to his master or mistress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet will fly at any strange feline, and our friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carib-beetle, and the others, made no attempt to molest</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of our live stock, although they would instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack others of the same species in their natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">state.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They appeared to take naturally to the rapidly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing bombardiers, and would frolic and play with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them exactly as an overgrown mastiff will frolic with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a playful puppy. And never did the young bombardiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">show any tendency to use their deadly gas. Brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with us and with the ants, they had no hatred or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, and though they would rear and raise their tails</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a most threatening manner when teased or irri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated, they always bluffed. In fact, they were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-tempered and apparently so thoroughly weaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their natural habits, that I very much doubted</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they would prove of any value as guardians in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an attack, and I was rather anxious to test them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time they were fully grown, the rains were</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and we were again able to make extensive trips</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the land. Several times one or more of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">pets accompanied us, and as we walked along and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombardiers scurried about, examining every nook and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cranny, now and then locating and devouring some</seg><seg type="columnLine">grub or larva, I rather wished that we might run</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a solitary ant, just to see what our companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do. But I had no need to come upon one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these terrible creatures to satisfy myself. As we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing through a patch of jungle, three huge red</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants suddenly rushed at us. Instantly I recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as of the same species I had seen duelling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agricultural ant. Remembering the savagery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocity shown by the red ant on that occasion, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized we were in the most imminent peril.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly fitting an arrow to my bow, I discharged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the missile at short range and saw it strike fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the thoracic segments of the leader of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trio. Tom also transfixed one of the creatures; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrows seemed to have little effect other than to</seg><seg type="columnLine">halt the creatures temporarily until they could bite</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the arrow shafts. The next second there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush and our attendant bombardiers hurled themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the enemy. As instinctively, as intelligently and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as efficiently as though they had never known confine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, the four beetles followed their natural and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctive tactics and the episode of the solitary ant was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reenacted before us. I verily believe that a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombardier could have worsted the three red giants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But with the four of them, the battle was so short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp and decisive that it was literally a massacre.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within ten or fifteen seconds, the three red ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stupefied, dying from the bombardiers' gas, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the triumphant four were gorging themselves on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh of their victims. I was more than satisfied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With our bombardiers accompanying us, we need have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fear of savage ants, and I was also pleased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover that the beetles did not draw the line at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">496</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one species of ant, but attacked the red fellows as</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly as the black solitary ants. Tom was tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendously elated and enthusiastic, and he declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphatically that he believed our pets could vanquish</seg><seg type="columnLine">an entire army of the army-ants. But when it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to getting the bombardiers in hand once more, we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no little trouble. Indeed, for a time, it looked as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we might have to leave them to revert to their natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives. Their savage fighting instincts had been aroused;</seg><seg type="columnLine">temporarily they had forgotten they were supposedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">domestic animals, and they turned on us savagely, rear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up, opening their jaws and lifting their tails as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if about to attack us with a discharge of their deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas. But Tom, oddly enough, considering his fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild animals, appeared to be absolutely unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of danger in the case of his pets. Talking to them a?</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might to a rebellious dog or a fractious horse, he-</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced boldly, slapped the creatures with his big</seg><seg type="columnLine">black paws, grabbed them by the necks and half-urged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-dragged them away from their unfinished feast. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly gasped, expecting the beetles to turn on him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but evidently they recognized their master and, finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could not frighten him, they submitted and trotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">along beside us as docile as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was upon the return from this trip that we met</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the most exciting event that had as yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">transpired. On our way back towards the ant colony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came upon a column of the leaf-carrying or drough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er-ants. They made no effort or attempt to attack us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but our bombardier-beetle companions went at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fig. 82--a, Worker of Palyergus lucidus, the "shining amazon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">a permanent slavc-moker of the Eastern United States; b. Head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of same, showing the sickle-shaped mandibles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">From "Ant Communities," by Henry C. McCook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moving column with a concerted rush. I had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to see them overwhelmed or destroyed, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of the droughers were hurrying along their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathway. Unquestionably, I thought, they would destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few of the ants; but even their agility, their ferocity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their deadly gas could not combat hundreds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants. But I had yet to know the fear the bombardiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspired in the minds of their natural prey. No sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">had our pets leaped to the attack, than the hurrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants abandoned their burdens, and scattering in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, made good their escape, leaving their fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their fates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In one respect, however, the leaf-carriers had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage over the bombardiers. They were far more</seg><seg type="columnLine">agile and quicker in their motions than the solitary</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants or the big red fellows, and they were of a race</seg><seg type="columnLine">that deemed discretion the better part of valor. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of stopping to give battle, they turned and ran,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only one unfortunate, overpowered by the bom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bardiers' gas, fell a victim to the beetles' ferocity. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">we waited for our allies to satisfy their insatiable ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petites for ant flesh, my attention waa attracted to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">objects the fleeing ants had dropped. To my amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, I discovered they were ears of corn. Where had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ants secured these, what were they doing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them? The answer to my mental query flashed across</seg><seg type="columnLine">my brain instantly. The droughers were inveterate</seg><seg type="columnLine">thieves in other countries, as I knew. In a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">night they will carry off a bag of rice or a sack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">corn, kernel by kernel. There was no wild corn here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There could be but one explanation. They had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbing our friends, the agricultural-ants. There had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a raid and probably a battle. Had our friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">been defeated? Had they been destroyed? I feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worst, and calling to Tom, and, regardless of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">resentment, beating and luring our bombardiers into</seg><seg type="columnLine">obedience, I hurried in the direction of our hut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was even worse than I thought. During our</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence the droughers had swept down upon tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceful agriculturalists and had left death and</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction in their wake. That the owners of tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">property had put up a stiff fight was evident. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where dead and dying ants were lying about, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were far more bodies of the raiders than of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agriculturalists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No doubt their insect allies had aided them in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense, but against the hordes of leaf-carriers, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance had been futile. As I glanced about at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims of the battle, I noticed several of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">red warriors I have mentioned. For a moment I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled as to their presence among the raiders. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I examined them more carefully and discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were of the same species as the droughers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I realized the truth. They were the soldier-caste of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the robbers, professional fighters. No wonder the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agriculturalist had flown at the red warrior he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">met in the forest. He had recognized him as an arch</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy and had known that he was a scout spying</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the agricultural ants' homes and that had he not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been destroyed, he would have carried word to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unquestionably, c!so, the three, whom we and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombardiers had destroyed, had also been scouts. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt scores of other scouts had been lurking about</seg><seg type="columnLine">for days, and the attack had been most carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned. Very probably, I thought, our presence had</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled the raiders and they had deferred their at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack until we had absented ourselves. I was rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled to account for the fact that I had never seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the big warriors accompanying the leaf-carriers</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their legitimate business, and I came to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusion--which I later found was correct--that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting individuals invariably remained in their homes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except when required for actual warfare or scouting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Obviously, too, they were not numerous, for which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was most thankful, for, had their numbers equalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of their working fellows, life would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible in the forests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately, too, the raiders were strictly vegetarians</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hence, once they overcame the resistance of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims, they contented themselves with taking posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of the agriculturalists' stores and crops, and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not attempt to destroy the ants or their young. Hence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although scores of our friends had lost their lives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulk of the colony had sought safety in their sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terranean burrows where we found them, huddled to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, frightened out of their senses, and reminding</seg><seg type="columnLine">me most forcibly of human beings panic-stricken by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some catastrophe they are powerless to overcome or</seg><seg type="columnLine">avert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But not an ear of corn or a grain of wheat re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained in the colony. The place was stripped bare and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">497</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">our own hut had been completely cleaned out. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be months until another crop could be harvested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and starvation faced the unfortunate ants. But unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neighboring colonies had also been raided, supplies</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be obtained from them, and, already, the ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured by our presence that the enemy had gone, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying off towards their neighbors in search of help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Until this time I had never fully realized the feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of friendliness I had for these ants. I was as angry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as worked up and as upset by the raid as were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants themselves, and yet, as far as Tom and myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">were concerned, we were really none the worse for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">visit of the droughers. But somehow it affected me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a personal matter and my mind was filled with far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from peaceful thoughts, and I was busy trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">formulate some plan by which I might even \up scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prevent any future raids. For us two t6 attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to destroy or even attack those hordes of giant rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers, with their powerful fighting corps, would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of folly, and I well knew that it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally hopeless for me to attempt to induce the agri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culturalists to carry war into the enemy's country, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say. They were far too peaceful and peace-loving</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight, except in defense of their lives or property,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had no means of conveying ideas to them, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">had they been born fighters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was one thing certain. Steps must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken to render the colony less open to a raid than it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. No doubt, as I have said, the droughers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept upon the colony many times in the past, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet the victims of their attacks had never done any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to prevent the robberies. The low wall was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense, and the entrances or gates were always open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To be sure, the leaf-carriers could climb any wall it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be possible to build, but a higher wall would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinder them, a gate which could be closed would pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent their dashing in and out freely, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no reason why the storehouses should not be fitted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors or gates which could be closed from within, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">preventing the robbers from making off with the ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumulated food supplies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to convey my ideas on these matters to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants, but of course without success. But if they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand my gestures or my words, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick to grasp an idea once they had it demonstrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, and they were wonderful imitators. So, trust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing they would fall-to and help us, once they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we were about, Tom and I began gathering ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terials and preparing to construct movable barriers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The material which seemed best adapted to our pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses was bamboo. It was light, strong, easy to cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">and handle and was, I knew, about the only material</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could expect to work with the hunting-knife as our</seg><seg type="columnLine">sole tool. It was not difficult to build doors or gates</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bamboo and we progressed rapidly. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">method was to lay a number of lengths of the bamboo</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by side, lash these together with tough vines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">place a second layer across these at right angles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lash these to the first. To be sure, the first door we</seg><seg type="columnLine">made, and which was designed for our own home, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude, but it was strong and stout, and when hung in</seg><seg type="columnLine">place by means of bark loops over pegs for hinges, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was indisputably a door. In fact I felt quite sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would resist the efforts of even the most pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erful ants and that it would prove an effective barrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a human being unless he were armed with an axe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Needless to say, the ants were intensely interested</seg><seg type="columnLine">and curious. But their curiosity and interest gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to obvious amazement and surprise when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the door in place. They ran excitedly about, opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed it, tested its strength and even tried ineffec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually to force it. But it was not until Tom and I car-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ried loads of bamboo to the vicinity of their main</seg><seg type="columnLine">•storehouse, and commenced work upon a second door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they realized that it was not a device intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">solely for our own use. But the moment they saw us</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructing another barricade beside their own build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, they understood and fell to work with a will,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing in vines and bamboo and aiding us in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">way possible. Often I laughed to myself at thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange picture we must have presented working</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in the midst of the great, truly terrifying-appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing creatures. And yet, so accustomed to the ants had</seg><seg type="columnLine">we become, that it seemed perfectly natural for us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be laboring in their midst and, to me at least, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer seemed insects; rather they seemed strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive but friendly savages. They were wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully skillful and resourceful creatures. Their jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as useful as saws, knives and axes; they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredibly strong, and their six legs were all brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">into play at one time. Their intelligence, too, was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANTS, of course, are noted for their intelligence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but hitherto, I had always felt that this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much overrated and that a great deal of the supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence of ants was in reality purely instinct.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But here were ants, who had never in the history of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their race seen doors or any structure of bamboo or</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber, but who, nevertheless, were showing them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves far more skillful in the strange undertaking than</seg><seg type="columnLine">were we two humans. By the time the door to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">granary was completed and in place, the ants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly capable of constructing their own doors, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I had to do was to indicate the opening to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplied with a door, by placing some material beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I was truly amazed also at the mathematical ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curacy with which the creatures fitted the doors to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the openings. They would scramble about apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">aimlessly, feeling the walls with their antennae, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would then build a door to exactly fit the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, in many cases, was irregular, arched or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">oval in form. Finally, every aperture in the buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">was equipped with a door and only the opening in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall remained. This was an undertaking that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired several days and it was while the work was</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeding that another idea occurred to me. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been puzzling my brain over some means of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing a defensive wall or barrier, when I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our escape from the army-ants. Here was the solu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. We could construct a moat about the settlement</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the water would prove an insurmountable barrier</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the droughers. The land was practically level, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-sized stream flowed within a few yards of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the fields, and while it would be a tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">undertaking to dig a wide deep trench about the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">colony I felt sure it would be worth the trouble and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was a job that Tom and myself could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope to accomplish. The ants must do this for them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, and the difficulty was how to show them what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in mind and for what purpose the ditch was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended. I had seen them digging irrigating ditches--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trenches to drain the surplus water from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields, but how was I to make them understand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they must dig a huge ditch completely encircling their</seg><seg type="columnLine">domain? However, I did not give the ants enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit for their intelligence or their confidence in me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Digging ditches was one of their normal and everyday</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupations, and I had merely to start digging, to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a husky gang of workers digging like mad, wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">I turned the earth. I would have given a great deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have known what their ideas were, what purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">they thought I had in mind. But I feel sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">498</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they associated the ditch with the doors and with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent raid, and that their quick intelligences had</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped to the conclusion that both were designed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own protection. At any rate, trench digging</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on apace, and I thought, as I watched the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, what wonderful aids they would prove to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">army and how easily and rapidly a regiment could</seg><seg type="columnLine">dig itself in if accompanied by a corps of these giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects. But the next day the ants sprang a surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">on me. Each ant appeared carrying one or two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white blind termites I had seen within the gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leries. The instant these creatures were placed within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trench, they commenced to burrow like mad, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing the work of several ants, and fairly making</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dirt fly. All the ants had to do was to carry out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loosed earth and guide the termites and keep them</seg><seg type="columnLine">going, for the pale-bodied creatures had a tendency to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop digging as soon as they were a few feet below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface. They were in effect living drills, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more astounded than ever at the resourcefulness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants in thus availing themselves of the natural ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dencies of the termites. Here at any rate, the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quilines had been forced to earn their keep. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks were required to complete the moat, but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was done at last and connected with the stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">and filled rapidly with water, I felt quite sure that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colony was fairly safe from further raid3 by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">droughers. In fact, I had a rather amusing and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly convincing demonstration of the efficiency of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my trench when we returned to the gate in the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had quite overlooked the fact that we would be cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off by the moat; but here we were on the wrong side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trench accompanied by our gang of tired ants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To Tom and myself the moat was nothing. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not over six feet in depth and barely twenty feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">width, and either of us could swim it in a few strokes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But to the ants it was an insurmountable barrier. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as completely cut off from their homes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends as by a raging torrent. Wildly excited, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed up and down the banks, while on the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">side their friends were just as troubled at seeing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows unable to return to their homes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wondering if it was merely fear of the water on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the part of the ants or if they actually were unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swim, I plunged into the moat and after a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">strokes climbed out on the opposite side. The distress</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ants was really pitiful. One poor fellow, braver</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the rest, tried to follow my example and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved from drowning by the narrowest margin. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that they could not cross and, not wishing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble or excite them further, and somewhat afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might turn upon me as the author of their pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicament, I again swam the moat, and, with Tom's</seg><seg type="columnLine">help, cut a number of bamboos and with these formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crude bridge. Hardly were the bamboos in place</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the ants rushed across them to be welcomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their friends as though they had been miraculously</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised from the dead. To build a light, strong bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bamboos was our next undertaking, and this we ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged like an old-fashioned draw-bridge, so that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be raised or lowered from our side of the moat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was a never-ending source of delight to the ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, I feel sure, made many wholly unnecessary trips</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the nearby forest merely for the sake of traversing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge. But I was not yet wholly satisfied. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered the ingenuity the army-ants had shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">in attempting to reach us by forming a living bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the stream, and I did not feel at all sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the droughers might not be equally clever. All the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had been working on our defenses I had been think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, trying to evolve some plan to strike a decisive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and salutary blow at the droughers. How I wished I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had my medicine-kit. If I had possessed a few bi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chloride of mercury tablets, or my calomel, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have wiped out the droughers or so decimated them</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there would be no danger of attacks for years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ants, as I had often demonstrated when they became</seg><seg type="columnLine">troublesome in any tropical camps, are strangely affectcd</seg><seg type="columnLine">by mercurial poisoning. It appears to drive them</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane, and once they have tasted it, they will fall upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another ferociously, fighting to the death, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">each one swallows more of the poison as it bites its</seg><seg type="columnLine">maddened adversary, an entire colony is soon destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">much after the fashion of the famed Kilkenny Cats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I had no mercury bichloride, no means of securing</seg><seg type="columnLine">any, and I knew of no natural ant poison in the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. Bisulphide of carbon would be as efficacious as</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercury, and while there was an abundant supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulphur in deposits about hot springs and fumeroles</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the mountain sides, I had neither the apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor the chemical skill to produce the volatile bisulphide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the thought of sulphur gave me an idea. Would it</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be possible to locate the droughers' nests, surround</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with sulphur, and setting fire to this, destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ants with the fumes? I had no compunction about</seg><seg type="columnLine">resorting to such means. Despite the fact that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were giants in size, the leaf-carriers were merely ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it speaks volumes for the state of my mind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vagaries of human psychology that, while I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded the droughers a3 vermin to be destroyed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any or all means, I looked upon the agriculturalists as</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends and fellow beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To secure a supply of sulphur was easy enough, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to locate the homes of the droughers was a more diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult matter. To be sure, it would be easy to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">their trails to their nest, once the trail was found;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but oddly enough, during all our stay in the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on our innumerable trips, we had not met the leaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriers more than three or four times, and each time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were far from the colony of the agriculturalists.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That the raiders had come a long distance, I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure; but a long distance to us humans would be but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short trip to the droughers, who, as I have men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned, moved at terrific speed and traveled farther in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half hour than a man could walk in two days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MOREOVER, we had no idea where to start. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiding ants had left no visible trail, but I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, like bees, ants returning to their nests, usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel by the straightest most direct route, and I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided that our best course would be to start at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot where our bombardiers had attacked the raiders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and follow as nearly as possible the course they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been taking when we had surprised them. It was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy matter to locate the spot where we had met the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiding droughers, and after a few moments consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation, we decided upon the general direction they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been following. All through the first day we tramped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Nothing of any great interest transpired, but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">made one or two interesting discoveries. Among others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we found a most interesting example of protective color-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation--not the type whereby a defenseless creature imi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tates its surroundings, but of the more remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">form wherein a defenseless creature mimics in form</seg><seg type="columnLine">or color some dangerous creature. Quite unexpectedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suddenly we came upon a gigantic solitary-ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting quietly upon a stone at the edge of a clearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the forest. Without our bombardiers, which we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left at home fearing they might apprise the droughers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our proximity, we were practically at the mercy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrible creature. But apparently he had not seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">or scented us, and hoping to escape his notice, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew hastily back trying to step noiselessly. But Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunately tripped upon a root and crashed back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">499</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. Instantly, at the sound, the ant was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert. He reared himself on his hind legs, raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great head and swung quickly around towards us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terror-stricken, I sought about for some spot, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge wherein we could battle against the monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I felt sure was about to rush at us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then something about the creature struck me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">being peculiar. I peered intently at the giant insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roared with laughter, while Tom gazed at me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently thinking I had suddenly gone mad. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next moment he had every reason to think I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken leave of my senses, for I deliberately approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dreaded creature, picked up a stone and tossed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. Tom yelled in terror, expecting the ant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dash at me. But instead, the huge, ferocious-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect turned tail and scurried off as fast as ^iis six</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs could carry him. He was in fact an out-and-out</seg><seg type="columnLine">fake; a sheep masquerading in wolf's clothing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not an ant at all, but a harmless beetle, so in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of offensive or defensive tactics, that Nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">had protected him from enemies by fashioning him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the form of a solitary-ant. My first close scrutiny of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature showed me that he possessed no powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandibles, although at first sight he appeared to,</seg><seg type="columnLine">owing to the manner in which black and white mark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings were arranged about his mouth. Neither were his</seg><seg type="columnLine">antennae those of an ant, while his seemingly slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist, his round thorax and ant-like abdomen were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">optical illusions produced by white markings upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stout, heavy thorax and bulky abdomen. But he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a most remarkable counterfeit, and would have passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a true ant anywhere, unless his make-up was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected by the trained eye of an entomologist.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a short time after unmasking this fellow that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we luckily came upon an abandoned road of the leaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrier. Although partly overgrown with weeds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass, it was still recognizable, and I had no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">it led to the nest and had been abandoned when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply of proper vegetation at its other terminus had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been exhausted. I was not mistaken. A few hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">later we came to a cross-road, and although no ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were visible, I knew from its appearance that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">daily in use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had no desire to be seen by the droughers, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of their giant warriors still was uppermost in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind, although I had no fear of the ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers. Moreover, if my plan was to be successful, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to approach the nest when its occupants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at home and resting. To attempt to walk about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nest and arrange my sulphur would be impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">with endless streams of busy ants passing back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth; and I had no definite knowledge as to the hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the leaf-carriers ceased their labors and betook</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to their underground chambers. Ordinarily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew, they were most active during the day, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tropics, as a rule, the relatives of these ants re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired to their nests at night. But I also knew that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequently made raids during the night-time and, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">several occasions I had found the ants passing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day underground. Just what the hours of labor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest might be with these particular ants must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned by observation. So, making a short detour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we cautiously approached the road once more. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times we repeated this, until to my satisfaction, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large cleared space in the forest, and in the centre</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this, the enormous mounds of refuse and earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">which marked the home of our enemies. From hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">places back of the trees, we watched and saw a num-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  •A very common form of protective coloration among insects is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which a harmless species or genus imitates a dangerous or offensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">species or genus. Many flies bear such a close resemblance to bees that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they arc left undisturbed. Beetles imitate hornets and ants. Moths imi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate bees and wasps, and many butterflies, which are edible to birds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other enemies, arc colored to imitate noxious or inedible species.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the big droughers come rushing from another</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathway and vanish in one of the openings in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mound. No others were in sight; none emerged, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was near sundown, I assumed that the ants'</seg><seg type="columnLine">labors were over for the day. Retiring to a spot at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a safe distance, we ate our dinner and waited patiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">until nearly dark. Then we again approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants' nest, and as no ants were visible. I decided our</seg><seg type="columnLine">time was ripe. Treading softly, for I felt sure the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants beneath the ground would be aroused if they heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unusual vibration caused by our steps, we worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">diligently, encircling the nests with a pile of leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twigs, scattering sulphur among them, and arrang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a pile of inflammable material and sulphur in each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the openings that led to the underground galleries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last all was ready, and striking fire, I ignited the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves, and rapidly we spread the flames from pile to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Choking and coughing with the fumes of burning sul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phur, we stamped, shouted and danced above the homes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ants, anxious now to arouse them and bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">them forth. Then, holding our breaths, we dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ever-thickening fumes and took up posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of vantage on the windward side of the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our noise, our pounding and the smoke had almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantaneous results. Ants by scores came pouring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling from their burrows. But as fast as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged, they fell victims to the fumes of the sulphur.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Over their dead bodies poured others--workers, war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors, great fat-bellied queens; drones and even in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quilines. The whole place was a writhing, squirming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying mass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Terrified by the fire, overcome by the smoke, killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the fumes, utterly disorganized and at a loss, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants fell by the thousand. A few broke through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">encircling fire, only to succumb a few yards beyond,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by the time the fire had burned out and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last pale-blue flames of the sulphur had died down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a living ant was visible. Moreover, the mound</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself had caught fire and was a smouldering red-hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, and I knew that any ants, any young or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">eggs that might remain within the chambers would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly destroyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had wreaked vengeance in full; we had entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">annihilated that den of robbers.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">made several trips a3 the weather improved, always</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking for some means of escape. It was on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these trips that, for some inexplicable reason, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor seized me to go out of our way and visit tho</seg><seg type="columnLine">black savages. Heaven knows I had no sane reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for wishing to do so. They were bestial, horrible crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, far less human in many ways than our clean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly agricultural ants, and I ought to have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">content to let them mind their own business, while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded mine. But something, some uncontrollable urge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">led me on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we reached the aphis orchard, we heard strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds from the distance; gutteral cries and most</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar animal-like noises. Wondering what could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and thinking the savages must be holding some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of dance or ceremonial, we hurried towards their</seg><seg type="columnLine">village. But as we came within sight of the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">area and the mound in its centre, we halted abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drew quickly into the shelter of the trees. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us a terrific battle was in progress. Everywhere upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clear space about the blacks' village there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting, struggling knots of the black savages and</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, yellowish-red creatures which I at first took</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be some species of giant ant. Everywhere, too,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ant* colloctlng honey dew from an Aphid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">From ''Naturc'8 Craftsmen," by Henry C.

Never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">I seen such savage, vicious fighting, not even between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most ferocious insects, and for a moment I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">spellbound, watching as if in a trance, the savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">warfare before us. Despite their repulsiveness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bestial characters, my sympathies were all with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blacks, for they were human at least. But despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">my sympathies and my desire to aid the savages, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no desire to throw myself into the fray. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ago exhausted my pistol cartridges; our weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">were crude bows and arrows and spears, and--yes, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had almost forgotten it, very useful slings such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">(he Andean Indians use--and while I had no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we could give a good account of ourselves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could injure or kill a number of the enemy, still I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the ultimate result would be our own de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction. As I watched, I noticed that while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks used every effort to kill their adversaries, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter appeared more anxious to capture or disable</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages than to annihilate them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the most astonishing thing, that which held me</seg><seg type="columnLine">spellbound and oblivious to all else, was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange creatures were not ants, as I had at first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. What they were I could not even imagine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In many ways they were ant-like. They possessed six</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, they resembled insects in the arrangement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorax, head and abdomen; their enormous nipper-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws were those of warrior ants; but there all re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblance to ants or other insects ceased. Their eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed lids, and instead of being fixed, glassy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressionless, like those of insects, they were movable</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as capable of expression as those of a mammal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their antennae were almost rudimentary and they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">well developed ears. And, instead of all six legs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet being similar, each pair differed from the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rear legs were heavy, strong and terminated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad clawed feet admirably adapted for supporting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creatures and gripping the earth. The central</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair were flexible, slender and ended in digited mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers most astonishingly like hands, while the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair were short, immensely powerful and bore terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">pincer-like claws somewhat like those of a gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">lobster. Moreover, the creatures did not behave in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least like ants or any other insects. They stood, most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, erect; they moved swiftly and with amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">agility upon their hind legs; they used their middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of limbs like hands, and they wielded their front</seg><seg type="columnLine">claws like weapons. That they represented an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely new order of animal life, a peculiar connecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">link between the true insects and the crustaceans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed certain, and yet their eyes and their actions</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be almost those of vertebrates. So in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely interested in the creatures had I become, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I scarcely noticed the battle or other incidents of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene, and I had quite forgotten our tame bombardiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">until one of the beetles rushed forward towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling combatants. Instantly I realized that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">interference would prove equally disastrous to both</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black savages and their foes, that his deadly gases,</seg><seg type="columnLine">released among those struggling close-locked figures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would overcome all alike. Then an amazing thing hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. The bombardier checked its onward rush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffed suspiciously, and turning tail, came dashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with every symptom of terror. At the time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had little chance to marvel at this. From the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite side of the open area a column of the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">red creatures was issuing. Without attempting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid their comrades in their ferocious battle, they hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried directly towards the low wall surrounding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">village of the blacks, swarmed over it, and vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the subterranean galleries of the savages. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">now the fighting was almost over. Nearly all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black beings were dead, wounded, or prisoners, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had given a good account of themselves. Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more bodies of their enemies, than of their own, lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered about the battlefield. Perhaps a dozen were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still fighting, but they were rapidly overpowered, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their prisoners surrounded and completely cowed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red creatures stood waiting. Presently, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks' homes the strange invaders began to emerge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each I noted, carrying r burden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next moment I gasped in astonishment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">burdens they were carrying were the young savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had seen in the underground nurseries. Squirming</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yowling, but firmly held in the powerful claws</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their captors, the infantile savages were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne towards our hiding place. Terrified at thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being discovered, realizing too late the danger we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in, we turned to rush for safety among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">denser growth. Before we had taken a dozen strides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrifying figures surrounded us, huge claws darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and seized us, and screaming, fighting but helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the vise-like grips of the monsters, we were borne</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumphantly back to the horde of awful creatures with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their human loot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">501</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVEN in our extremity, during that terrifying time,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I was astonished that our captors did not offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to harm us. The creatures who held me were in fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">most considerate, even gentle. For brutes who, a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments before, had been fighting so savagely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibiting such ferocity, their present actions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing. Of course I did not struggle or resist</seg><seg type="columnLine">--such a course I knew would be worse than useless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and poor Tom was too far overcome with terror to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than move one foot before the other, as his cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors led him forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our arrival before the horde of the creatures caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous commotion. One huge beast, who appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a leader, hurried towards us, examined us min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utely and uttered strange squeaky sounds which re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded me more of the creaking of rusty hingfls than</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything else I had ever heard. Instantly my captors</seg><seg type="columnLine">released me. But not so with Tom. With scant cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony he was hustled to the groups laden with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicking, squirming black captives. The next instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throng commenced to move away from the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, with its litter of dead and dying, and headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right with the captives, Tom included, in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst, and surrounded on all sides by the compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively few unburdened creatures. They gave no heed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me and it was obvious that I was free and of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest to them. Why this should be so I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although the comparison was not flattering, yet it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been evident to the beings that the blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself were equally human. And it must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been equally evident that Tom was also a human being.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why then should they have attacked and carried off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the youthful black savages, taken possession of Tom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and freed me? The only answer I could think of was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was a matter of color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both the savages and Tom were black, while I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, or rather I should say red, for I was tanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and burned by the sun until no one would have recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized me as a white man. Possibly, I thought, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird, puzzling, ferocious beasts might classify human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings by color alone. Tom being black would be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered in the category of their victims of the battle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I would be regarded as a friend, or at least no</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy, because my color was somewhat like theirs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed a far-fetched theory but it was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one that occurred to me. But I had no mind to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main there while Tom was being carried off to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible fate. So, hurrying forward, I joined the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cession, and presently, growing bolder now that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">first terror of the things was overcome. I managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">push my way in towards the creatures guarding Tom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even then the red giants paid no more attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, than if I had been one of their own sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when I tried to force myself between Tom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his captors, the latter roughly shoved me aside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated that I was to remain at a distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their captives. But they could not prevent me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to Tom and I did my best to try to reassure</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and to assure him that I would stand by him no</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter what happened. The sound of my voice ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to amaze the creatures, and the entire company</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to an abrupt halt and stood staring and listening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Tom's voice simply astounded them. At his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first words his captors sprang aside in evident fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But their surprise and terror was only momentary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we again marched onward, I studied the creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutely, and once more I revised my idea as to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">identity and place in the animal kingdom. Now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could observe them closely, I was once more con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that I had been correct in my first surmise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that they were ants. But if they were ants,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking from a zoological viewpoint, they were as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suredly most remarkably specialized ants. And yet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside from their lidded eyes, their well-developed ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their unusual feet, they were distinctly and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakably ant-like. They were, in fact, exactly what</seg><seg type="columnLine">one might expect had evolution proceeded along insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines and had ants, the most intelligent and advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">of insects, reached a stage comparable to that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pithecanthropus in the mammalian genesis of evolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Antennae had become of secondary importance as</seg><seg type="columnLine">auditory organs were developed. Movable eyes had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped through necessity, and variable lenses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pupils had made soft eyes essential and consequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">lids were needed to protect them. And with advance-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and specialization of characters, the variable feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">might well have resulted. The fact that they com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municated by means of sounds was not so surprising,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that I came to consider it. For all we know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary ants and other insects may communicate by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of sounds pitched too high or too low for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human ear to detect. And the fact that the voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these creatures were audible to me merely proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">that their vibrations happened to come within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range of my own sense of hearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Realizing this, realizing that the creatures were</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more than huge, highly specialized ants, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehension came to me like a flash of light, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had puzzled me was made clear. They were slave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping ants; they were the warriors of some colony</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had made a slaving raid, and instead of fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants, they had taken possession of the degenerate</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings and were carrying them into slavery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Tom was destined also to be a slave to these super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants. All our common, well-known slave-holding ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so abundant in many lands, are red; always they make</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves of black ants, and here these gigantic red ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">still ran true to Nature's laws and chose black beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their slaves. It solved the problem of my treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and freedom also. Not being black I could not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ants' way of thinking, be made a slave, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hence I was of no value or interest to them, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">made war and attacked other creatures solely to obtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">a supply of slaves.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If I were right in my surmises and deductions, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt convinced I was, then personally I had nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fear from these semi-human ants. But my blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiled and I was furiously angry at thought of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly taking possession of Tom as if I had no rights</seg><seg type="columnLine">or say in the matter. Still there was something ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely ludicrous in the thought of Tom being a slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could picture him trying to act as nursemaid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a young ant, scurrying about seeking food to supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">his owners, laboring at building the ants' nests or</seg><seg type="columnLine">digging subterranean tunnels. He would, I imagined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">be about the most useless and inefficient slave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants had ever owned. And with this thought came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new fear. I had watched and studied the habits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our common slave-holding ants far too often not to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly cognizant of their customs, and I well</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the fate that befell their black ant slaves if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to fulfill their allotted tasks or to satisfy their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel owners. Death swift and certain was their por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and Tom, I felt certain, would fail utterly, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he did not assert himself and submitted to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  •Many species of common ants possess slaves. Oddly enough the slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">owners are red and the slaves black. The slaves--which are reared from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captured pupae and eggs of the black ants--are faithful, industrious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and perform practically all the labor of the colony. So dependent upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their black slaves are some red ants that they are unable to feed them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. When on a slave-hunting raid, these ants send scouts ahead to</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate the nests of the black ants and conduct the attack on military</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines, with skirmishes, rear guards, flanking parties, shock troops and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">502</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slavery. A human being serving as the slave to ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">masters! It was unthinkable, monstrous, impossible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet, the black savages were human, and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me the red ants were carrying off the savages' in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fants. For the first time I noticed that not a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">adult savage had been borne away as a captive. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though many had been taken alive and unharmed, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been released when the victorious raiders had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted. It was all very clear to me, now that I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were slave-holders and were following precisely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same habits and customs as any ordinary slave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping ants, with the sole exception that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">substituted black human beings for black ants. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">while they were acting much as do human slave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiders, yet they showed far greater wisdom and fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. Instead of carrying the adults into slavery, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">being forced to expend a vast amount of time fn</seg><seg type="columnLine">teaching and training them, as well as in forcing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to labor and in addition losing many through one</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause and another, they were making slaves of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">infants who, reared among their owners, knowing no</seg><seg type="columnLine">life but that of slavery, would be easily trained, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never rebel at their lot and would grow to maturity as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideal slaves. No doubt, too, the red giants had other</seg><seg type="columnLine">and equally excellent reasons for leaving the adult</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks behind, and for taking pains not to kill more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than was essential to their victory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LEFT unmolested, the blacks would continue to breed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and increase, for I could not imagine them having</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient intelligence to move to a new locality or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">provide defenses against further attacks, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would thus provide a constant source of supply for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave-raiders whenever the latter required new slaves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No doubt these red fellows had been systematically</seg><seg type="columnLine">raiding the blacks for generations. But all this, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mulled it over in my mind, did not pacify me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least regarding Tom's plight, nor did it account</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the reds taking possession of him, an adult. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only answer I could find for their thus making an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exception of him was that they had looked upon him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as my slave, a trained slave from infancy, like their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, and had calmly taken possession of my property.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The more I thought of it, the angrier I became. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures were no better than highway robbers. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to attack them single-handed, to attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover possession of Tom, for somehow my first in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense dread of these super-ants had given way to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme contempt for them. But my common sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevailed. I realized that it would merely mean de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat, injury and probable death for me, and that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that case Tom would be irretrievably doomed. No, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far wiser for me to control my feelings, follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with the procession to the ants' destination, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust to some chance of rescuing Tom without endan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gering ourselves overmuch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up to this I had been too preoccupied with- my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts to notice that our bombardier beetles had</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted us. I was puzzled, but then the actions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these beetles had puzzled me from the time of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">first meeting the slave-raiders. Why had they appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened? Why had they failed to attack these</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ants with the same ferocity they had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibited towards others? Surely they must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized them as ants. And why had they now</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted us? I could not even think up a theory to</seg><seg type="columnLine">account for their actions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime we had made a wide detour, had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aphis orchards far behind, had passed at a consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able distance from the colony of agricultural ants, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were approaching a portion of the valley I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">previously visited. Eventually, as we topped a low</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hill, I saw that we were close to the area which on</seg><seg type="columnLine">several occasions I had viewed from a distance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had always assumed was a second colony of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black savages with their neighboring aphis pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. Now, as we drew near, 1 discovered that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a great mistake. The orderly expanses of trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">were aphis groves to be sure, and the herds of clumsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bovine aphids we saw were being herded by blacks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but here and there among them stalked great red</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave-holding ants. They were the owners of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aphids, the masters here, and the black herders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely their slaves. Unquestionably we were close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the homes of the slave-raiders, and presently we left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orchards behind and came out upon a broad open</seg><seg type="columnLine">space with a great conical mound in the centre.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everywhere were the red giants and everywhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying about on numberless duties, laboring in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broiling sun, toiling under heavy burdens, were scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the subjugated human slaves. And yet, even then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not avoid feeling that of the two, the ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the superior beings, that the naked, misshapen</seg><seg type="columnLine">black savages were far inferior to their insect masters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, in this remarkable spot, the whole order of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things seemed to be reversed. Insects dominated, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only indigenous human beings were degenerate, miser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able brutes and were entirely subservient to the forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of animal life, which man is accustomed to consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the lowest orders of creation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I noticed, too, that there was a great diversity</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the giant slave-holding ants. Those whom I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied and who had raided the blacks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">obviously warriors or soldiers. A few of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort were to be seen around the immense ants' nest</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards which we were now proceeding, but there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">far more of totally different forms. Many of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">others had enormous heads, weak bodies and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">atrophied legs and were apparently blind, for despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that they possessed fixed fishy-looking eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each was being guided and led about by attendant</seg><seg type="columnLine">black slaves. Others were burly, heavy-bodied creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">with small heads, inconspicuous jaws, great staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, well developed antennae and such long, slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs that they appeared almost more spider-like than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant-like. It was this type I had seen with the aphid</seg><seg type="columnLine">herders, and I now saw that they were all engaged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the blacks and in keeping them at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. We had now reached the summit of the mound</seg><seg type="columnLine">and paused at the verge of the great crater-like de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression in the centre with the various dark openings</seg><seg type="columnLine">to subterranean burrows piercing its sides. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted, a horde of horrible-looking creatures emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tunnels. That they also were ants and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to the colony was evident, but they were totally</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct in form from any of the others I had seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their jaws were huge, but were blunt thick-edged af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairs. Their eyes were minute, almost invisible; their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies were swollen and their legs short, stout and</seg><seg type="columnLine">terminated in peculiar blunt-ended claws that somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like pudgy, toil-calloused hands. As these slov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enly, almost grub-like beasts reached the waiting war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors, the latter handed over their squalling, infantile</seg><seg type="columnLine">captives to the newcomers. With skill, which could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only have been born of long practice, these creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the black youngsters, holding them securely</seg><seg type="columnLine">but without injury in their powerful mandibles, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried with them to the burrows whence they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T)UT Tom was a problem. As he cowered and yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">-D and struggled at the approach of the things, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">after another would examine him, and apparently satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied that he was not an infant--and perhaps recogniz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">503</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the fact that he was not of the same race as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other blacks, they would move off without offering to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take charge of him. The warriors squeaked, croaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and evidently became insistent, but without result.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The nurses, for I knew that was what in reality the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blunt jawed individuals were, would have nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do with the big adult negro. Their duties were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">care for infant slaves, to rear them, train them per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, until old enough to labor for their masters, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had no interest in grown-up slaves. Like all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of their kind, they were highly specialized for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their particular place in the complex social and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munistic life of these ants and had been developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through countless generations to perform one set of</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties and only one. It was the same with the war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors. They had become specialized for conducting</seg><seg type="columnLine">raids and taking prisoners and were at an entire loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it came to any other matter. And it was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious that they were now at a most complete loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it came to ridding themselves of Tom. Through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out their lives and the lives of their innumerable an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cestors, warriors had gone forth, had battled, had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned with captives and had delivered the captives to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proper individuals. Not until they had been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved of every prisoner were their duties at an end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and here they were with a captive of whom they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not rid themselves. So intensely socialistic were they,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so synchronized their brains or instincts, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole army was as much affected as though each in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual were personally responsible for Tom. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stood, all completely upset, all waiting on the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had Tom in their custody. More than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">was I impressed by the shortcomings of ants' boasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence, more than ever I realized the futility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">communism when carried to the extreme, and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever I appreciated the fact that ants, no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">how huge, no matter how super-developed, would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">attain the heights of human beings. As long as every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing went smoothly and along accustomed lines, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were capable of accomplishing anything, and exhibited</seg><seg type="columnLine">what appeared at first sight to be real intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reasoning. But once their accustomed line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">action was interrupted, once anything without pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cedent took place, they were helpless. And there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one individual, no group of individuals, to get them</seg><seg type="columnLine">9ut of a dilemma, to meet unforeseen circumstances</seg><seg type="columnLine">and find a way out of difficulties, to give orders or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be obeyed. In short, there was no head, no leader, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruler among any of the ants, and therein lay their</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest weakness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All these thoughts flashed through my mind in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. The next instant I was hurrying forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here was my opportunity. The warrior ants had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts, no ideas except to get rid of Tom and thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulfill their allotted duties as ordained by their special</seg><seg type="columnLine">development, their duties and their instincts. Probably, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, they would not care a jot who took their trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blesome captive in charge, as long as he was off their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. And quite confidently, with these convictions in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind I strode to Tom's side, seized him by the arm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to drag him off. Without offering the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance, his captors released their hold and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly, as if I had given them an order, the assembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors broke ranks and scurried off to their under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was delighted, immensely pleased that my deduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions had proved so correct. And Tom, poor fellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost speechless with delight. But we were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get off so easily. As we hurried down the slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mound and started across the cleared area to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the woods beyond, one of the long-legged slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">drivers glanced up, stared in our direction with his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Odd toilet attitudes. Ants cleaning the legs and the stinging organs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From "Nature's Craftsmen," by Henry C. McCook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">protruding, almost crustacean-like eyes, and the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant came racing towards us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just what his intentions were I neither knew nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to enquire. With Tom at my side I dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward at topmost speed. But we were no match</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the big ant. Now I realized why these fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed such muscular bodies and long legs; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were built for speed; they had be?n developed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries, ages, for the sole duty of watching and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarding slaves and for chasing those who attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape. Evidently the fellow racing after Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself thought Tom was a runaway slave. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought of me was of no particular interest at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. And what punishment was customarily meted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to slaves who attempted to escape, I did not know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I had no doubt it would be drastic and that I, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an abettor of Tom's break for liberty, would be treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">far from gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither Tom nor myself had any intention of sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitting to capture tamely. We had been surprised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken at a disadvantage, when we had been made</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners by the raiders; moreover, they had outnum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered us fifty to one. But with this single long-legged</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow after us, it was a different matter, and even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excitement of the time, I saw that he was alone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that none of his fellows had joined in the pursuit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Realizing we could not outdistance him, I gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp command to Tom, and halting, we both wheeled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quickly we fitted arrows to bows and let drive. Tom's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft went wild; he was still trembling and shaky</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his experience, but mine struck the oncoming ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly in the thorax. He plunged forward on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, turned a complete somersault and lay helpless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as we were about to turn to hurry on, another</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the long-legged fellows came speeding towards us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing to do but stand and fight. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still far off but to run would merely be to exhaust</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves. His six, long, powerful legs would carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">him twice as fast and countless times farther than</seg><seg type="columnLine">our legs. And to battle with him, even if by good</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck we were as successful as with his companions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not better us much. There were dozens of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort scattered about the plain, and I had no doubt but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that as rapidly as we destroyed one, another would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take his place. Why several did not start for us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">unison was a mystery, but I assumed it was age-old</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom and instinct for individuals to recapture run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aways, and I let it go at that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">504</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I have mentioned, Tom and I possessed slings</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had found quite serviceable in the past, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, not caring to waste arrows which were valuable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we whirled the primitive weapons and hurled a shower</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rocks at the oncoming ant. Several struck' close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, one or two whanged against his body, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck and broke the second leg on his left side. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something quite unexpected and new to his expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rience. With the same lack of initiative, with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter failing of intellect and reason which I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">referred to when face to face with any novelty, the fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low stopped in his tracks, not knowing whether to</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat or advance. He made a tempting mark, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as rapidly as we could load and whirl our slings we</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued our fussilade. Whether we killed or</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded him I do not know, for all our interests were</seg><seg type="columnLine">centred on an unexpected development.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our ammunition, rough stones of various sizes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes, was not conducive to accuracy, and the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jority of our shots went wild. Some thudded harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly upon the open ground, but two or three dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the midst of a group of black savages attending</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the blind fat ants. Whether the slaves were</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually struck or not, I do not know; at any rate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling stones brought cries of terror and frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams from the blacks, and completely forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their charges, thinking only of getting away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">descending missiles, they took to their heels as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil had been after them, as no doubt they thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was. Instantly every long-legged slave driver within</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight was up and going. Here, to their minds, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave-break, and almost before we had recovered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">our surprise at this unexpected denouement, the chase</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in full swing and heading directly away from us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our way was clear, and making the best of our oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity, we gained the shelter of the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SINCE I last opened my notebook to record events,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have gone through a greater trial than has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been my misfortune since entering this place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But thank God all ended well, and it is now a thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the past. Much as I suffered, poor Tom suffered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand times more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having escaped from the red slave-owners, who no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt found too much to occupy their attentions in</seg><seg type="columnLine">recapturing their slaves to bother chasing us, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached our home (we now called this agricultural-ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">colony our home), in safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time nothing of great moment happened. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">made many new discoveries and found many new</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, and we also vastly improved our weapons. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we knew of the warlike slave-owners, we felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of weapons more than ever. Not only did we</seg><seg type="columnLine">make better slings, but having proved the value of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these primitive weapons, we spent much time search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for pebbles of uniform weight and size, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded as possible, to be used as missiles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, having nothing better to do, we spent many</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours chipping and pounding uneven pebbles into</seg><seg type="columnLine">spheroidal form, until we possessed a large store of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball-like stones. Then we made a discovery which</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused us to feel that all our labor in this direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been wasted. In a clay bed near the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of a stream, we came upon great quantities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly spherical nodules of great weight, veritable</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets in fact, nearly as heavy as if made of iron,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I recognized as cassiterite or stream-tin. Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercially, this would have been a great find, and, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">I been free and within reach of civilization, my for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune would have been made, for a short search re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed the fact that the bed of the stream was literally</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">paved with the valuable ore. Here, ready to hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were missiles for our slings which were immeasurably</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior to ordinary pebbles, and for several days we</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried loads of the nodules to our hut. I laughingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked to Tom that if we had only possessed a can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">non and powder we would have had most excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition and could make short work of any at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tackers. In fact this started me on a new train of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, and a wild scheme of actually making powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and firearms entered my head. I had no doubt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder could be made, for as I have said, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boundless supply of sulphur; charcoal was to be had</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the trouble of making it, and I knew that by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little experimenting I could produce saltpeter by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a rubbish pile or "nitraria" such as I had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in Paraguay. But I could think of no way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">making any sort of a cannon or gun. Of course I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that in ancient times the Chinese used firearms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bamboo or even of wood, but even to fashion such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things was beyond our capabilities. However, just to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass the time and to satisfy myself that it was pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to do so, I decided to experiment with gunpowder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I therefore proceeded, with Tom's help, to accumulate</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quantity of rotten vegetation, dung, offal from game</seg><seg type="columnLine">we killed, and other waste material, and built up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good-sized mound in a remote spot. As it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">several months before this would decay and produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nitrate I desired, we set to work on other matters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our hatchet-like weapons had proved most useful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in pondering how we could improve upon these, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered the saw-edged swords of the Aztecs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it occurred to me that we might construct something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a similar sort. Where we had destroyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drougher-ants there were a number of the hard, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely tough and sharp jaws of the defunct war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors, jaws like enormous shark's teeth, and we gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered several dozen of these. Then, with a great deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trouble, we hacked and whittled out sword-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of palm wood with serviceable handles. Along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edges of these we fastened the ant-jaws, securing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in place by means of fibre cords and a cement-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like wax that I made by a mixture of bees' wax, pitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the juice of some species of rubber tree. I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay claim to any inventiveness on my part in making</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, for it was nothing but the "karamani" wax used</seg><seg type="columnLine">extensively by the Indians of Brazil and Guiana for</seg><seg type="columnLine">attaching their arrow-heads to the shafts; but it served</seg><seg type="columnLine">our purpose admirably. The savage-looking weapons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when completed, were fearful things, and Tom grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from ear to ear as he swung his about his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed a desire to try it upon some enemy. Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">did we dream how soon that wish would be fulfilled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So accustomed had Tom become to the weird crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures and unusual conditions, that he frequently went</seg><seg type="columnLine">off alone in search of game or for other purposes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not unusual for him to be absent for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours at a time. Oddly enough, too, the gigantic in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects had apparently acquired an instinctive dread of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us humans, and for a long time we had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacked by any of the inhabitants of the forest. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, several times when we met creatures which, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few months previously, would have attacked us sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agely, they showed every desire to get away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Whether this was due to that remarkable inherent</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread of human beings which animals acquire after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short acquaintance with man, whether it was the result</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our activities, or whether it was the result of expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rience, I cannot say; but even the predatory hornets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrible solitary-ants and the ichneumons seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid us. Still, we were usually accompanied by our</seg><seg type="columnLine">domesticated bombardier-beetles. These were now of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fifth generation, and having been bred in captivity</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">505</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and descended from tame ancestors, they were most</seg><seg type="columnLine">docile and intelligent creatures. The agricultural-ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">even had become thoroughly accustomed to them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came and went about the colony and made friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the various inquilines and insect guardians of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place. Also, I must not forget to mention that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter creatures had become equally friendly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, evidently having come to the conclusion that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were recognized and accepted members of the colony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The huge dragon-flies in particular showed great intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ligence and would sail down and alight near us, waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectantly for us to toss them bits of meat while</seg><seg type="columnLine">we ate. It was fascinating to watch these creatures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I could only liken to living airplanes, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned their enormous thin-necked heads from side</seg><seg type="columnLine">to side and watched us with their gogglingv many-</seg><seg type="columnLine">facetted eyes and licked their chops and prbtruded</seg><seg type="columnLine">their remarkable folding jaws. As far as our good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natured ant hosts were concerned, matters proceeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as before. We had never learned to communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate with them except by signs, but we had developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fairly complete sign language, and despite the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ants about us now were many generations</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed from those whom we had first met, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have inherited all their ancestors' knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of us, and acted exactly as if they had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">had us with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of these things I have mentioned at some length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all have a very direct bearing upon that great</seg><seg type="columnLine">calamity which befell us. Tom had gone off on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunt, but when he had not returned late in the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon, I began to feel uneasy. Then, when late at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night his two bombardiers came home, and I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one was limping and badly injured, I felt certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some accident had befallen my faithful friend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I no longer looked upon him as a servant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout that long night I paced back and forth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to sleep, torn with fears, and conjuring up</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions of the awful future in store for me in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom liad been killed and I should be forced to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in this terrible land of insects. As soon as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dawn I started out, but it was, as I knew, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost hopeless undertaking. I had no idea in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction Tom had gone and all I could do was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wander aimlessly, shouting and hallooing. At night</seg><seg type="columnLine">I returned discouraged, saddened, despondent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly heartbroken. But I pulled myself together. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must not give up. My life depended upon finding Tom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alone I could not exist here, and I determined that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should I fail to find him within a week's time, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">should I find his dead body, I would do away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, rather than face the certainty of insanity which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew would result if I dwelt for long alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO, day after day, I tramped the forest, the valleys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plains and the mountains, searching for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">only fellow man in all this land. Forcing myself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think calmly, I laid out a regular course, covering</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different area each day, until, on the sixth day, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">that section near the slave-holders' colony remained un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched. I hated to go near this spot and I put it off</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the last, partly from my inborn fear of the slave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">owners, and partly because I felt sure that Tom would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have gone in this direction. One day more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruitless searching and I would give up. In fact I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far more occupied with thoughts of how I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">commit suicide, than with thoughts of facing the slave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holders, as I set off in the direction of their farms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless, I proceeded cautiously. I had no desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fall into the clutches of the big red brutes a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, even though I could take my own life as readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them as elsewhere--a strange psychological</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">state of mind to be sure. And neither did I fail to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout Tom's name and to halloo as I proceeded. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone far and felt I must be nearing the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the slavers when I stopped, my breath suppressed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ears strained. From somewhere in the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought I had heard a faint call. Could it be pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible? Was Tom somewhere in this neighborhood?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having no fear that my cries would attract the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention of the ants, for I felt certain they were deaf</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all human voice vibrations, I bellowed at the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my lungs. Again I listened, and again it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me I heard an answering cry. But it might be echo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might be an hallucination; in short, it might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result of my overtaxed nerves and brain. Forget-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting caution, I rushed forward, shouting as I ran.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly, beyond the fringe of forest, I saw open</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, and instinctively I halted and proceeded more</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously. Before me stretched a newly-cleared space</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the trunks of the aphid trees I knew so well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here and there black slaves were toiling under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchful eyes of their horrible red masters, and for a «•</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I watched them. Tom, I knew, could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, and I was about to turn away when I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of something which caused me to stare with wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulous eyes. Close to the forest edge beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other slaves and their masters, two great red ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were standing, and beyond them, working like the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves, was a single being as black as his fellows but</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was clad in rough garments! Instantly, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed my eyes and convinced myself I was not de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lirious, I knew it was Tom. Strange that I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of this possibility before, that it had not oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred to me that he might have been captured by</seg><seg type="columnLine">these slave-owners. But the joy that filled my heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">at seeing Tom alive and apparently unharmed, drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">all other thoughts from my mind. But how to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; how to free him from his masters? To rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindly forward and attack his guards was, I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suicidal. Although the red ants had not harmed us</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, I felt quite sure that should I attempt to rescue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom from their clutches, or should I attack them, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would fall upon me and end my career in short order.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment or two I pondered. - Then an idea, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one I could see, although mad and desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, occurred to me. Tom was working close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest, within easy call, and by carefully circling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the area within shelter of the trees I could, I thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach a spot within a few yards of him. Then if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could attract his attention or could talk to him with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his captors' knowledge, it might be possible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to make a quick dash. For what might follow I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not plan. I felt sure that his two guards would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the only ones to start in chase, and these we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy, once they were out of sight of their fellows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cautiously retracing my steps, my heart beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard with excitement, I crept through the jungle until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt I had reached a spot about opposite the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I had seen Tom. Stealthily, for while the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants might be deaf they possessed keen senses, I stole</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward until I could peer through the dense growth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes, there, within a dozen yards of the forest edge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Tom, and at sight of him at such close quarters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbridled rage at his captors possessed me. Evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not submitted tamely to captivity nor to forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor. His skin was covered with wounds, and I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the expression on his face that he was suffering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Regardless of all else, willing to take the risk of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations of my voice alarming the red ants, I called</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name and a cautionary warning. I saw him start,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen and glance up, but by no other motions did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">betray his surprise. But to my dismay I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant ants had also detected my voice. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Telling Tom to indicate which flower ho had approached, I extended the bill-hood spear until the point touched the blossom. Instantly, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the petals, five long, green tentacles shot out and entwined themselves about the spear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">506</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">507</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing about and waving their antennae, evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to locate the spot whence the unusual vibrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come. Luckily for us they were drivers and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors, for the latter possessed true ears and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would no doubt have located me instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even as it was there was no time to be lost.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever we did must be done quickly and before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants realized what was afoot. Desperate measures</seg><seg type="columnLine">were essential, and all my preconceived plans were cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside. Tom, of course, had no weapons, and like a flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">I realized that he must pass close to one of his guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he dashed to me as I had planned. Quickly fitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arrow to my bow, I raised my jagged sword with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my other hand, swung it, and shouting to Tom--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here, Tom, grab this and run!" I hurled it towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The weapon fell almost at his feet, and scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it touched the earth when my arrow flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the sunlight and buried itself in the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin between the thorax and abdomen of the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant. Everything happened at once. As the ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled up and fell, Tom seized the sword, leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, dealt the prostrate ant a terrific blow that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed its head to pulp, and gained my side. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ant, dazed at the suddenness of it all, hesitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment. Then he was after Tom, while his fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest to him came hurrying towards him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again I fired but missed. There was no time to fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">another arrow to the string. If we tried to run we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be overtaken. There was but one course open:</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand and fight, to destroy this nearest creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was now within a dozen feet of us, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush off before the other ants saw us. In terse rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">words I said as much to Tom, who seemed unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp the fact that he was free, unable to speak for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment. But he could act, and backing against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree and grasping his sword, he prepared for battle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My only defensive weapon was my knife, aside from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sword, my bow and arrows and my sling, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be hand-to-hand fighting. But Tom gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">no opportunity to use my weapon. He had scores to</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle with the brutal red beast, and all the long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dormant savage blood of his African ancestors was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused. With a hoarse yell, he leaped forward, swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jagged sword, and with a vicious side-sweep, sliced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head from the oncoming ant at a single blow. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winking of an eyelid the fight was over. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">way lay open before us, and at top speed we rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">off through the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEHIND us, now and then, we could hear sounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pursuing ants. How far they followed us I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot say, but at last the sounds ceased, and feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were in no danger, we slowed down to a more com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable gait. Poor Tom was all in. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakened by his wounds, he had been almost starved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the excitement of the duel and escape had about</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished him. But as he limped slowly along, he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me bits of his story. He had been surprised in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest by two red warrior ants, and though he fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">savagely, he had been overcome and made a prisoner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of his wounds had been received in this struggle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the others were the result of his refusal to herd</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the repulsive blacks or to work for his masters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shuddered and actually wept, as he related how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red ants had bitten and tortured him, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">with devilish ingenuity they avoided maiming him so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would still be able to work. How they had seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">his limbs in their jaws and had bitten until he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if his bones would crack; how they had nipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of flesh from his back and chest until screaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the pain, he had submitted. And during the six</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible interminable days he had had no food, except</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the stinking offensive stuff fed to the horrible half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human blacks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Undoubtedly the ants had thought him an escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave and had therefore punished him the more severe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, but that made his condition no. better, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">days before the poor fellow was able to be up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. Meanwhile I was filled with a new dread. If tha</seg><seg type="columnLine">red warriors roamed the forest searching for runaway</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves, they would be a constant menace. No doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, they were untiring, skilled trailers, possessing all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marvelous powers and instincts of anta combined</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a super-intelligence, and sooner or later, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would locate us. At any moment, if we ventured into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest, we might be discovered and attacked, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had little doubt that, after their recent experience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would be in force. And if we remained within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the confines of the Agricultural-ants we would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe. Although I had done everything to render the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place as nearly impregnable as possible, still I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the red soldiers, if numerous enough, could reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and that we could not count too much upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance of the agriculturalists. The more I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this matter, the more certain I felt that sooner or</seg><seg type="columnLine">later we would have to wage a decisive battle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">these slave-holding ants. And the more I thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and talked the matter over with Tom, the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to hate the creatures and to wish that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could wipe them from the face of the earth. In fact, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">even thought of training our peaceful hosts, of equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping an army, and of going forth to attack the slave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">owners, instead of waiting for them to take the offen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive. But before I reached any definite decision in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this direction, another event transpired which, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, drove all thoughts of the slavers from our minds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whenever we went on any hunt (we had long since</seg><seg type="columnLine">given up our hopeless seeking for an exit from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley) we kept as far from the district of the slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">owning ants as possible, and invariably bent our steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the opposite direction. I thought that we had pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">well explored the valley within a radius of eight or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten miles of the colony of agriculturalists, and that wo</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew practically every square mile of this side of tha</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. But a tropical forest can hide most conspic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uous things within a very small compass, and I soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had another proof of this. Passing through a rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense stretch of jungle, Tom stubbed his toe upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, and, glancing down, I saw that the object was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a squared and sculptured piece of masonry. Instantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my curiosity was aroused, and intently I examined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing as we cleared away the moss and dead leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. It was beyond question the work of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and a sudden wild hope seized me that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be other men in the valley after all. A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later I realized how groundless were my hopes, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fragment of stonework was immeasurably ancient.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it proved, at least, that human beings had at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">time dwelt in the valley, and the work upon the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that they were no savages, that they were cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured, perhaps civilized beings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Where there was one bit of sculptured stone there</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be others, and excited, my interests all aroused,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wre sought diligently amid the tangled vines and trees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently our efforts were rewarded. Overgrown and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden so that even a dozen feet away they were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible, we came upon the ruins of a great stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. Concealed as it was, I recognized it instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as being the handiwork of the same race that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">built Tupec. Here indeed was an amazing discovery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet I should have known, from the fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel from Tupec led to this valley, that the race must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have known of the spot. Everything else Was for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time forgotten, and we devoted our time until dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">508</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to clearing away the jungle and exposing more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the ruins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Determined to learn all I could of the place, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">what earthly good it would do me, I do not and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not then know, we returned the following day with</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hammocks, prepared to camp by the ruins and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursue our investigations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each hour that we worked increased my wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my interest. The first building we had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">was but one of a dozen or more, each surpassing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last in workmanship, in beauty of sculpture and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">archeological interest. Indeed, as we wandered about</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the forest, we soon discovered that we were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">midst of ruins far more extensive than those of Tupec;</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins of what must once have been a magnificent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">large city. What, I wondered, had become of the race</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dwelt here? Why had they vanished? Why had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no descendants remained? Cudgelling my brains for</seg><seg type="columnLine">answers to these puzzles, I arrived at the conclusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the inhabitants of this city must have deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley and established Tupec, for all my investiga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions proved more and more conclusively that Tupec</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the more recent of the two, although that, I knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">must go back for countless thousands of years. What,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wondered, were the conditions of this valley in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-distant times? Was it inhabited by overgrown giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of insect life or had they been the result of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopment after human beings had vanished from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">district? And then one day the mystery was cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">lup. In many places the massive masonry was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">held together by the binding roots and vines, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we cut away a mass of these, a large section of a wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave way and came crashing down. Behind it yawned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great black opening, and, peering into this, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the entire walls were occupied by innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">niches, and that in every niche was an earthenware</seg><seg type="columnLine">jar or vessel. Here was an archeological treasure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trove, although as worthless to me, in my present</seg><seg type="columnLine">plight, as were the dead and twisted lianas we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hacked away to expose it. But while I fully realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, still my scientific ardor was in no wise diminished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was as filled with interest and delight as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could carry the specimens and my story to my fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">men at any time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE light within the chamber was dim, but on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following morning, with the sun shining into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aperture, all was bright and clear in the great room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I gazed fascinated and entranced at the rows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of magnificent decorated wonderfully moulded pots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should not, however, say pots, for aside from the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were all more or less pot-like in form, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew at my first glance that they were not vessels in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the true sense of the word; rather they were effigy</seg><seg type="columnLine">or portrait-jars, of a type new to archeology and</seg><seg type="columnLine">modelled with truly amazing fidelity to nature. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were human figures in every conceivable attitude,</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures of birds, mammals, crustaceans, insects; figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reptiles and molluscs; figures of monsters unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, and representations of fruits, vegetables, flowers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves and of every imaginable combination of all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So perfectly were they made, so beautifully colored,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I knew they must have been made from life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gazed spellbound at the counterparts in miniature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ancient inhabitants of the valley and of Tupec.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as I moved about studying these archeological</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvels, it suddenly dawned upon me that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not placed within their niches hit or miss, but were</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged in some definite order, that they were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbolic, and that their relative positions conveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">some meaning. I felt sure of it. I felt convinced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me was a history, a codex, telling the story of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the ancient race. A story, written in effigy jars in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of in carved symbols on stone or in written</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters, but a story none the less. If I only had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the key! If only I had some hint of the cipher!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now they were as meaningless to me as so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooking utensils. I did not even know where to begin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the symbolic figures started from right or</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, from top or bottom, or from which one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four walls of the chamber. I stared at them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I might hypnotize the inanimate objects into</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing their secrets. And slowly, as I gazed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest jars a strange, almost uncanny feeling came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed to me that I was beginning to see light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that comprehension was dawning upon me, that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was actually penetrating the secret of the sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolic vessels. There, before me, was a vessel bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the perfectly modelled figure of a stooping man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon its surface was depicted human beings busy at</seg><seg type="columnLine">some labor. In the man's hand was a tool, a hammer</seg><seg type="columnLine">or maul, and before him a slab. It was plain enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. He was cutting a stone and the painted figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">were working on a stone building. The next jar on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right bore the figure of a woman and child, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the right side of this the next vessel showed a bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">with wings wide spread. But on the left side stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">a magnificent jar showing a man in elaborate head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress and costume holding his hands aloft and above</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was a flaming sun. To the left of this was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel of strange squarish form and covered with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">painting clearly showing a sacrifice being held upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pyramidal altar. Eureka! I had it! I fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced and leaped about, until Tom must have felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that I had gone mad in contemplation of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">"trash" as he called it. I was more excited than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been for years. I forgot my plight, my surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. I had made an astounding discovery, and I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced that presently, with a little study and</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience, all the mysteries of the ancient race and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tupec would be solved for me. There could be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt of it. I could grasp the system now. Here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone cutter, symbolical of building; next the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted edifice and the high priest worshipping the sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the sacrifice. Almost feverishly I examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jars further to right and left. The woman and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bird seemed to have no relation to the stone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutter, and those farther to the right seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">even less. I felt sure that I was right; that the sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bols should be read from right to left, and carefully I</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined those to the left of the sacrificial scene. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">were jars bearing effigies of corn, of cacao, of various</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetables, and with painted scenes showing planting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">harvesting and preparing food plants. Now that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved the puzzle of the system, I grasped the meanings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jars readily. First the erection of a temple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrifices to the gods, the tilling of land and cultiva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of food--a veritable genesis stood before me. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the utmost difficulty I controlled myself. For all I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew I was beginning in the middle of the story. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must search about until I found a beginning. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly, patiently I would set myself to decipher the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole. Never once did it occur to me how absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">futile was this labor, how foolish my elation, how ridic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulous my interest. My scientific brain demanded that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the history be read, my archeological interests drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">all other thoughts and considerations from me. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, I was oblivious to all else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as I examined the innumerable jars, striving</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find some hint, some indication of where the strange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly recorded history commenced, I noticed that here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were empty niches; that in others the jars</seg><seg type="columnLine">were plain, monotone vessels. Here were puzzles. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">509</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">did the vacant places and the ordinary jars signify?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Were they meaningless or had they some significance</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I could not fathom? Or were they--yes, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved that was the answer--were they representatives</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lapses, of years, or of decades, when no unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">events occurred or of which no records had been kept.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If so, if the latter were the case, I reasoned that in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier periods of the race's history there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more lapses, more periods forgotten or lost, and hence</seg><seg type="columnLine">the portion of the walls where the empty niches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain jars were most numerous would be the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the records commenced. And I cannot ade-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quately express my elation when I found that in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the walls the lowest rows of niches were almost all</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with meaningless red or brown jars, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the spaces were empty. To the left thej sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolic jars increased in number, and to the right all</seg><seg type="columnLine">were symbolic and obviously of much more recent date</seg><seg type="columnLine">than those on the'left. Beyond question, beyond doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was the beginning of that marvelous, unique his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, and only patience and concentration were needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make clear to me the whole story of the people, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once dwelt within this weird land, and who, I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced, had left the place and had erected those</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificent buildings at Tupec.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But all this had occupied a great deal of time. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun had passed far beyond the meridian, the room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with dark shadows, and only here and there did</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough light enter to enable me to distinguish the</seg><seg type="columnLine">designs upon the jars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was useless to try to do more until there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">better light, and regretfully I left the chamber, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to Tom's satisfaction. He, poor chap, was half</seg><seg type="columnLine">famished, although I had quite forgotten that we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">eaten nothing since the previous afternoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I CANNOT spare the space to record in detail our</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of the next few days. Controlling my im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience, I set to work with Tom to clear away</seg><seg type="columnLine">vines, branches and debris until at all hours of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day the sunlight could enter the room containing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jars, Then methodically, as painstakingly as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">identifying and cataloguing museum specimens, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked upon the symbolic jars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I worked, the meanings became plainer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearer, and within a few days I could read the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">they told, as readily as I could decipher the graven</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbols of the Mayas or the codices of the Aztecs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is no necessity to enter into the details of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. If I ever escape, I shall make it known to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific world, and, if I do not, of what use will it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all be? In fact I hardly know why I am writing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, why I am taking the trouble to record anything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless it be merely from force of habit and for my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction. Suffice to say, that the history revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by those magnificent examples of the ceramic art was</seg><seg type="columnLine">most fascinating, most tragic and most remarkable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whence the race came or who they were is still a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery, for, as I have said, the early periods of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence in the country were mainly blank or vague.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But that they came from overseas and migrated across</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast stretches of country was evident. Also my sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">position that they were a white race was borne out</seg><seg type="columnLine">by both the painted and modelled figures. Not until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had settled in this valley had history been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corded systematically. Then it proceeded almost with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out interruption. Each cycle of a certain number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, as nearly as I could judge approximately each</seg><seg type="columnLine">century, an empty niche indicated the beginning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new cycle. And if I am right as to the length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these cycles, then the race dwelt here in this accursed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spot for at least ten thousand years. Originally the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place was the home of some sort of huge bird, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather, judging from the representations of the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, some long-extinct flying-lizards, which preyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the insect life. Even in those far-distant days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insects here were of most unusual size, for re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peatedly, upon the jars, insects were shown in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany with human beings and nearly as large as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter. Unquestionably the giant bird-like creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept the insects in check, and, being harmless creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far as human beings were concerned, they were soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted and killed for food. With the short-sightedness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all human beings, the inhabitants continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy the feathered creatures until the last had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed. No longer kept within bounds by their natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies, the insects increased in numbers and in size.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crops were destroyed, human beings attacked, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence in the valley became a constant battle be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween man and the insects. Life became impossible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the inhabitants sought to migrate to another land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But during the thousands of years since they had en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the valley, great changes had taken place. Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of rock barred the pass through which their an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cestors had come; but in their desperate search they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a cave, a tunnel-like cleft in a mountain. Ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploring this, they found it led through the cliffs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven by necessity, thousands of men were put to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work enlarging and strengthening this natural passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they had drilled a tunnel through the mountain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Often terrific battles took place between the workers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the giant ants. But in the end, the human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">won. Deserting their great city, taking with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the essentials of life, they prepared to leave, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent all possibility of being followed by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect enemies, they planned to arrange the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the tunnel so that it could be closed behind them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could not be opened from the valley side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During all these years another race had lived in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley, a race of bestial black beings (the savages we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had met, beyond doubt) and though the civilized white</seg><seg type="columnLine">race was forced to leave or succumb, the semi-human,</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive savages continued to exist--a strange com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment on the boasted superiority of civilized man over</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive man, in the matter of survival. Here then</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all the puzzles and mysteries of Tupec made clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. No doubt, after escaping from the valley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">founding Tupec, a second history of symbolic jars was</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained. No doubt, somewhere amid the ruins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tupec, that priceless ceramic story still lies hidden, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my greatest regret is that I am doomed to know this</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shall never be able to find it and learn the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">history of that ancient vanished race of white men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the sculptured figures and carved effigies, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had so puzzled me at Tupec, are puzzles no longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They represented bits of the past story of the Tupe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can. The giant insects, the great feathered creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">--birds or flying lizards, I cannot say which--the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific battles with the giant ants, all were perpetuated</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in Tupec, yes even the black savages. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">within that tunnel, the fragments of horny matter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bones, which we found, were the grim reminders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those hand-to-hand conflicts waged between the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers of the tunnel and their insect foes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So interested had I become in this story of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">race, and so much had I dwelt upon the history of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the escape from the valley, that I became obsessed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts of possibilities of escaping that way our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. Might it not be possible. I thought, to dig away</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the entrance until we two could enter? Would it</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be possible to pry, cut or by some means'break</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the stone doorway? I thought of the her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culean labors of primitive races in stone cutting, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">510</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemingly superhuman feats men had performed. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one man could overcome such apparently insurmount-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able obstacles, could not we two do as much? We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had been too easily discouraged, I decided; we had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been supine, lacking in determination. At any rate,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we would have another look at the place, and so, re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gretfully leaving the ruins and its treasures, we re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turned to our hut, and a day or two later, set out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Upon our way, we met with many adventures and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">constantly came upon new things, but these were in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a way merely repetitions of those that had gone before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and are not worth the trouble of relating. But when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at last we came to the tunnel and I made a careful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">examination of the massive stone portal that blocked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it, my heart sank. At a distance, thoughts of forcing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a way through had seemed reasonable. Plans for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">patiently chipping away the rock day after day, month</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">after month, year after year, had not seemed visionary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But now, beside the flinty mass of stone, we seemed so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">puny, so incapable of making any impression upon it,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I was thoroughly discouraged. A thousand wild,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">impossible schemes passed through my mind. I even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thought of employing a horde of those ghostly, blind,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mining termites to dig under the door, only to discard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the idea the next moment. I could not direct their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">movements, they burrowed aimlessly, and, moreover, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could not use them without making our efforts known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Once they had burrowed beneath the door, the way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be open for all the terrible creatures of the val-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ley, and even for the sake of escaping myself, I would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not let loose the horde of giant insects to overrun the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">country beyond, and very probably spread over the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entire face of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">MY thoughts were interrupted by Tom. "Beggin'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yo' pardon, Chief," he remarked, "Ah was thinkin'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if how we had powder we right well might blow open</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tha door. An' Ah was rememberin' yo' was thinkin'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of makin' powder one time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I slapped Tom on the back until he coughed. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mind had seen light where mine was groping in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dark. Why not? If I could make powder, even a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miserable apology for the explosive, a charge properly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">placed might well dislodge the door and, once we had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crawled through, we could block the opening again,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even if to do so, we were obliged to blast the tunnel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down behind us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Fired with the idea, more optimistic than I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been for months, we hurried back to the ant colony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Going to my dung-heap, I raked the pile carefully apart,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and to my delight saw that clusters of dull yellowish-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white crystals had formed in the mess. Touching these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to my tongue, my hopes were confirmed. They were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unquestionably saltpeter, and although in small quan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tities and very crude, I had no doubt they would serve</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our purpose. Gathering every crystal with the utmost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">care, I found I had nearly a pound of the precious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chemical. But we would require many pounds to make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">powder enough for our purpose, and for the next few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">da^s we worked feverishly, making additional and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">larger "nitratarias."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It would, I knew, be weeks before we could hope</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for saltpeter crystals from these, but time was no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">object. In fact, we had long before lost all reckoning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of time. Meanwhile we would gather sulphur, make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">charcoal and carry on a series of experiments on a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pmall scale, in order to learn the best proportions of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the three ingredients to give us the explosive needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It is not necessary to recount the details of this. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had many failures before we had even a modicum of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">success and on the day when, touching fire to the re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sult of our labors, the black mess puffed up with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flare and a cloud of smoke, we felt as elated as though</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we had made a momentous discovery. Still we were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">far from having powder, which could by any stretch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of imagination be classed explosive. It was slow-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">burning, and although a charge placed in a section of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bamboo, split the tough fibres apart with a satisfying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pop, still a similar test with a pottery tube was an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">utter failure, the powder blowing out the plug without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smashing the inch-thick terra-cotta. Patience and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perseverance will accomplish wonders, however, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by the time our new crop of nitrates was ready, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had discovered the secret of mixing and grinding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">powder which, although far less powerful than ordinary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blasting powder or gun powder, would, I felt sure,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">serve our purpose. But it would require great care</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the utmost caution to prepare a sufficient amount</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to blast a way into the tunnel and it would be a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long time before we could hope to make the attempt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that might win us freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And_ long before that day arrived, other events</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">transpired which completely upset our plans. We had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been absent for two days at our sulphur deposit, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon returning found death and destruction in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">peaceful industrious colony we had left. Our hut was torn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to bits, our belongings scattered. Dead and wounded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">agricultural ants strewed the ground, and the sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vivors rushed aimlessly about, terrified out of their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wits. It was not hard to discover what had hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pened. One or two dead slave-holding ants told the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tale. But for a moment I was puzzled. Why should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">these creatures have raided the agriculturalists except</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in search of us? They never molested other insects</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">without reason, they made slaves only of the black</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">savages, and if in search of us, why had they attacked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and destroyed the others, when they failed to find us?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But those questions were soon answered. Cowering in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a dark corner of the agriculturalists' underground</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dwellings, we found three of the black slaves. My</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reasoning jumped to a conclusion at once. The poor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">creatures had seen Tom's escape; they had seized an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">opportune moment and had fled from their red mon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sters, and. either by savage instinct or by chance,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they had found refuge among the agriculturalists. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the reds had trailed them, and failing to recapture</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them had vented their anger and their vengeance upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the peaceful colonists who had given sanctuary to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slaves, as they had to us. No doubt the agricultural</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ants had fought valiantly, no doubt their insect allies</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had aided them; but the details of the fight we never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">learned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This murderous raid made me determined to settle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">once and for all with those uncannily human and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brutal slave-owners. I flatter myself that I am a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">peaceful man and I have always decried war, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now I was possessed with a most warlike and belliger-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ent spirit. Neither was I content to wait until the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reds should again take the offensive. I determined</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then and there to carry war into the enemy's camp, to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attack the reds in their own territory. But there were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">many obstacles in my way. For Tom and myself to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attempt such a campaign alone was out of the ques-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion. Even had we possessed fire-arms we would most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">certainly have sacrificed our lives in such a Quixotic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attempt. And it seemed almost as hopeless to think</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of inducing the agricultural-ants to aid us. In the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">first place, we could not communicate our ideas or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wishes to them; in the second place, they were not a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">warlike race. Then I thought of the black savages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They, after all, were the most intimately concerned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the slavers and they had the greatest reasons</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of all for wishing to have their oppressors destroyed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">511</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But how could I communicate with them? How could</seg><seg type="columnLine">I make my plans and wishes clear?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Help came from an unexpected quarter and in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unforeseen way. The three slaves had, willy-nilly attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to us and particularly to Tom. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">his color gave them confidence; perhaps the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had also been a slave of the reds inspired them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or possibly they realized that we were enemies of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave-owners, friends of the agriculturalists, and hence</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends of them. Low as they are in the scale of hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manity, I believe even these ape-like human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">possess some sense of gratitude. Otherwise I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain why they acted as they did. Why they watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">our every move, our every expression and listened at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentively to our conversation as if striving to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand us; why they should have been so anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">interpret our wishes, and to labor for us. If 'torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to do any simple task, a black would leap for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and perform the duty for him. If I wished an</seg><seg type="columnLine">object I had to point and a black would hurry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring it to me. And to my amazement, I found they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not the unintelligent dumb beasts I had thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though bestial in appearance, though unspeakably filthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in habits, yet they possessed brains and reasoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers far above those of the most intelligent quad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupeds. To be sure, all three were young specimens--</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere infants in point of actual age, but they were fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed, for like the apes, these savages mature in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an astonishingly short time. Undoubtedly, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been reared from the embryo stage by the ants, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been trained to work. But their aptitude for read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing our expressions, for interpreting our gestures and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the meaning of our words and orders, was truly</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous. Here, I thought, were creatures capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being trained, and if men can train elephants, lions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seals and other creatures as they do, why, I reasoned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could I not train these savages to a far higher degree?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once trained, they would be ideal soldiers, for I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen enough of them to know that they were born</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters, that they had the brutes' blind courage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of fear, once their fighting spirit was aroused. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I could train these three individuals, would it not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the bounds of possibility and reason that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make them understand my object, that I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to make them convey that knowledge to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of their tribe, and that, eventually, I might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a horde of savage blacks to accompany me on my at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack upon the red ants?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT I had not foreseen events which amazed me even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and made my task far easier than I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared hope. Within a week after being with us, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the blacks astounded me by pointing to my bow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clearly pronouncing the word "bow." Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumbfounded at this demonstration of the fellow's</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence and adaptibility, I decided to test him</seg><seg type="columnLine">further, and addressing him, said "arrow." For a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he hesitated, moving his thick lips as if pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncing the word to himself. Then, with a glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry he bounded off and came back carrying my sheaf</seg><seg type="columnLine">of arrows. I cannot express the astonishment that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt. The fellow actually had learned a smattering of</seg><seg type="columnLine">English! Had th„ others done the same? I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">left long in doubt. All three had not only learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the names of various articles, so they could pronounce</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, but had learned to recognize the names of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">more objects when I uttered them. From that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">on I bent all my efforts to teaching the fellows to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak and understand English, and with far better</seg><seg type="columnLine">results than I would have believed possible. To be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, there were certain words that were impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them to utter or to understand, but I soon found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we got on famously, by using words of Spanish,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">French or some Indian dialect in place of these. Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was trying my best to acquire a working knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their gibberish. I cannot say I succeeded well in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, but Tom very quickly learned their almost un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligible and gutteral words, probably because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some inherited aptitude for the tongue of his African</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancestors. Of course this took time. Weeks passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but so interested had I become in this work, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had almost forgotten my scheme to escape from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley and my determination to attack the red ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime, too, I had made still another</seg><seg type="columnLine">epochal discovery. I say epochal, for had it not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this, I doubt if my plans ever would have ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terialized as far as they have. This was the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that our blacks could understand and even communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate with the ants. No doubt, while they were slaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the reds, they had acquired some means of grasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing or receiving the vibrations by which their mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters communicated with one another. But it came as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distinct surprise to find they could converse--there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no other name for it although it was not conversing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ordinary sense--with the agricultural-ants also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as a natural result, with the giant dragon-flies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge bees, the Carib-beetles and even with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombardiers. Do not imagine, however, that I mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">to convey the idea that the semi-human beings could</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry on a discussion with the insects or could talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">freely with them. They could convey meanings to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants and their allies and could understand the insects'</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning to a certain extent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the time, this impressed me merely as being use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, for it paved a way for Tom and myself to get in</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer touch with our hosts by using the blacks as in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terpreters, but later it proved of inestimable benefit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a wholly unforeseen way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must, however, curb my desire to write so fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all that has transpired during the past months. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must confine myself to the most important facts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">events. Suffice it to say, that eventually I set out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom and our three blacks for the savages' headquarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the aphid-orchards. Of that memorable visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">I need only mention the results. With our meagre</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the blacks' language we- caught only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word here and there as they conversed with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming, curious fellows. No doubt they related mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velous tales, but the main point was that they fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed my instructions and explained my ideas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans. And of still greater importance is the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fellow tribesmen unanimously were with us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our plans to attack the red ants. Heaven knows they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had suffered enough to make them welcome such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity, but by themselves, so great was their</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror of their hereditary enemies, they would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have attempted such a thing. The first matter then</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to provide the blacks with weapons. Unarmed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were, they were no match for the natural fighting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines in the shape of warrior-ants. But with bows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and arrows, even with hatchets, spears and clubs, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be in a different state indeed. Much time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted to the preparation of weapons, and still more</seg><seg type="columnLine">to teaching the savages to use them, and I am sorry</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say that there were not a few casualties among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks, before I could make them understand that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to confine the use of their weapons to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies, and were not to practice on one another. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were so new and strange to them, that for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time they could not overcome their curiosity to test</seg><seg type="columnLine">them upon any living thing they saw. Repeatedly one</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage would fire an arrow into the body of a fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage, and both he and the victim would stand gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with most ludicrous expressions of utter amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the result. Never did I hear a wounded savag«</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter any sound denoting pain, and I am not sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">512</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they actually do feel pain. In fact they are a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzling lot, and at times I cannot settle in my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind whether they are men, apes, or insects. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">may sound like the ravings of a lunatic, but these fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows have some of the attributes of all three.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TOURING all this time I had a vague fear that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reds might raid the blacks prematurely, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not desire a battle until I was morally sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could emerge victorious. But luck or nature have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been with us, and so far no reds have put in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance. My blacks are fairly well trained in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of their weapons, and before very long I feel we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be in a position to give a good account of our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. Moreover, I believe the agriculturalists will</seg><seg type="columnLine">join us. They appear to have grasped the idea, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are naturally and by instinct so domestic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceful that I have little hopes in that direction. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have often thought of using my powder in connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my attack upon the reds, but I hesitate to use it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for such a purpose. I am still intent upon blasting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the outer world, and I only wish I had an inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haustible supply of explosive, for I feel sure that prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erly used, it would prove more destructive to the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave owners than anything else. Perhaps, however, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would so terrify my own forces that its effects would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be nullified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now I must set down some incidents that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem incredible. To us, in this amazing place, they do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not appear so remarkable as many other experiences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Discussing one thing and another with Tom, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counting our adventures, we brought up the matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the giant tortoises, and into my mind flashed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">joking remark I had made to the effect that the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">iand-turtles were like army-tanks. An inspiration came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. Was it not possible to transform that semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">humorous comparison into a reality? Could not those</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous, armor-clad beasts actually be used in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthcoming war?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had no expectations of training the beasts, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">well knew that the chelidae are among the most stupid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of creatures, and as far as I know, no one has ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to train a tortoise of any species. But a</seg><seg type="columnLine">turtle, once headed in a certain direction, will usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel in that direction almost as inexorably as fate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The immense beasts, moving across the ants' country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even over the ants themselves, would smooth down</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounds and earthworks and crush the insects as effec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually as a steam-roller, and no ant, not even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">;:iant solitary species, could make the slightest impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">■ Ion upon the tough skins of the turtles. Moreover, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was I felt the most important point, a man or</seg><seg type="columnLine">men mounted upon one of these living fortresses would</seg><seg type="columnLine">le in a far more favorable position to bash in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">l.eads and jab spears into the vitals of his enemies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or even to shoot arrows or sling stones, than from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Possibly I was a little mad, perhaps I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">still; but the idea took possession of me, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very next day, accompanied by our three blacks, we set</seg><seg type="columnLine">off for the turtle hill. We had no difficulty in locating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brutes, and no trouble in mounting them, but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive them back to our home was a very different mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. I have said that a turtle, once started in a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain direction, will continue to move in that direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But while I found this quite true in the case of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">(riant tortoises, the direction in which they moved was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not our direction. Try as we might, we could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">start them in the desired direction. For the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">lime the black savages showed signs of enjoyment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bense of humor. Never before had I observed either</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these human attributes among them, but here, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cur tussle with the ponderous but harmless turtles,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they were as gleeful and joyous as children. For hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">we labored, trying to induce the turtles to head to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards our distant home. We tried every device we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could think of--without success. If a turtle was turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction we desired he would either refuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move, and would withdraw into his shell, or in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly would wheel about and head another way. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have I dealt with such obstinate beasts. An army</seg><seg type="columnLine">mule is the most tractable of creatures by compari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, and it was as hopeless to try to use force as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been with an elephant. At last we gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in despair, and weary with our effort, left the tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toises to their hillside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But our trip to the turtle hill brought results of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very different sort. As we were returning, we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a column of the terrible army-ants. To be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not a large army such as that from which Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had so narrowly escaped long before. Never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless it was big enough to strike terror to our hearts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turning, we were about to flee for our lives when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stood rivetted to the spot at sight of the three blacks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of racing away from the voracious creatures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were calmly approaching them. In a moment the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost ants would be upon them. The huge scissors-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like jaws would seize the savages and tear them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits before our eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then an amazing, an absolutely incredible thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. The three blacks began dancing and leap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about, shouting shrill metallic sounds, and instantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if obeying an order, the advancing column of great</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind ants came to an abrupt halt. I could scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe the evidence of my eyes. By some uncanny</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, by some miraculous means, the three fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stopped that army of the most terrible of all ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there they stood, hissing and squealing, uttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange high-pitched notes, as if actually conversing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the army-ants. And that in effect was precisely</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they were doing. What they said, how they man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged it are matters entirely inexplicable to me; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact remains that somehow they controlled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures and conveyed their meaning to them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But still more incredible developments were to follow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leaving his companions, one of the blacks came hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to us, and in his broken, half-comprehensible man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, suggested to me that we should enlist the army</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants in our service.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I was perfectly sure I had gone mad. I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to feel that it was all an hallucination. That the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages, the ants, my plans for a battle, perhaps even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley itself were all figments of my mind. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea was unthinkable, too preposterous. And yet I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as sane as ever in my life. At any rate, I thought, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is madness, if all I have suffered and undergone</seg><seg type="columnLine">are merely my fancy, if it is all the workings of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">diseased mind, I might as well carry on in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane manner. But in my heart, I knew that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no question of insanity; that I was neither dreaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor suffering from any mental derangement, and that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered calmly, it was no more remarkable that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks could communicate with army-ants, than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could do the same with the red ants or the agri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culturalists. And if they could communicate with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why should they not induce the army ants to join us</seg><seg type="columnLine">as allies? For all I knew, they also were natural ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies of the red brutes; for all I knew they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends of the savages. And if the army ants did join</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, Heaven pity the red slave owners, when we at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVENTS have moved rapidly since last I wrote</seg><seg type="columnLine">describing our preparations for war upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red ants. It seems scarcely believable, but it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">513</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nevertheless true, that the army-ants have proved most</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tractable, and have exhibited the most astonishing in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">telligence. Neither Tom nor myself have any influence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over them, but our three blacks appear to be able to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">control them absolutely. I have come to the conclusion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that it is some form of hypnotism, that these savages,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only a step above the animals and insects, are much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">closer to the lower forms of life, mentally, than are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we, and that their minds, although far below ours in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">development, are yet so immeasurably above those of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the insects, that they can dominate the latter by will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or hypnotic power. To draw a parallel, just as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hypnotist with a powerful will and personality can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hypnotize a weaker-minded man, so these savages can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">control the actions and wills of the weaker-minded ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Unquestionably it is this power that has enabled them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to survive and hold their own in this land, from' which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the civilized white race was forced to flee. Or pos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sibly it is the other way about, and self-preservation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and necessity have led to these humans developing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their hypnotic power over their natural enemies. Cer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tain it is that, without some such power, these beings,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ignorant of the simplest weapons, never could have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">survived amid the countless hordes of giant, ravenous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">insects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the most surprising thing to me is, that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not used the same power to control the red slave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">owners. The only explanation is that these super-ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not subject to the mental power of the blacks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, it seems strange that, being able to enlist such</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts as the army-ants in their cause, the blacks have</seg><seg type="columnLine">not long ago led an attacking force against their red</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But no doubt it never occurred to them, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no inventive ability, no foresight and no imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and, having been for countless generations sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject to the slave raids, they have grown to regard</seg><seg type="columnLine">their plight as a natural condition. Not until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the matter to their minds did they dream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">organized action to protect themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I am wandering from the more important mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters of my records. Fortunately the army-ants needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no especial training, for they were naturally born</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers and possessed an organization and discipline</seg><seg type="columnLine">far more efficient than I could have evolved. All I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would require of them would be to head them for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red ants' colony and they would do the rest, and, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of this, I wondered why neither these slave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holders nor the agriculturalists had been attacked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelmed by their army-ant cousins. Our peaceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">hosts had been raided by the droughers and by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reds; I had witnessed battles between them and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitary ants, and yet, for some reason, they appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me immune to attacks from the far more voracious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and savage army-ants. There must be some explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, I felt sure, and I noticed that, even with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant-army near at hand, the agriculturalists came and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went and showed no fear of the terrible creatures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the ways of the lower animals are past human</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding, and despite the years of study which</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been devoted to them and the voluminous works</seg><seg type="columnLine">that have been published, we really know nothing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mental processes, the innermost motives and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instincts of the creatures all about us. We observe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain trait or habit, a certain reaction, and judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reasons and the causes thereof by our own re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actions and point of view, which, for all we know, may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be totally at variance with the lower forms of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never had these facts been made so obvious to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as since I have been in this valley, where insects rule</seg><seg type="columnLine">and predominate, and such humans as there are are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower animals, if I may so put it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But again I am getting off my subject and must</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop dissertating. I could not determine the reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our agricultural ants being on peaceful, if not</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly terms with our army-ants, and there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">use troubling my mind over it. It was fortunate that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was so and that was enough. Having seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange power which the blacks exerted over the army-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants, I decided to determine if they possessed the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a similar power over any of our other neighbors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as the giant bumble-bees, the dragon-flies and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carib-beetles, for if they did, and they could enlist these</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures in our service, we would possess a fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">force which could attack from the air as well as on</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot. The idea tickled me immensely, for it savored</seg><seg type="columnLine">of modern warfare with airplanes, and this conceit</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought another and more fantastic idea to my mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why not go a bit farther and use other methods of</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern war? Why not employ bombs, even gas, in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack? I might not be able to make firearms, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly should be able to design and construct some</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of explosive bomb or grenade. And sulphur</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumes would be as deadly to the red ants as the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible of destructive gases to human beings. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">would it be possible to train the giant dragon-flies to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry and drop such things? That was a great ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and I greatly doubted if the broad-winged insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">had enough intelligence to enable them to grasp the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea, even if, by some means, I could communicate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them through the medium of the black savages. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, even if this were not possible I could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">grenades which could be hurled among the ants, either</seg><seg type="columnLine">by hand or by some mechanical contrivance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE is no need to relate in detail all my efforts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my failures, my disappointments and my experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. I had comparatively little difficulty in induc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the dragon-flies to carry objects into the air, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was still less difficulty in getting them to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">these objects. The trouble was to get them to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things at the right time and in the right place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They appeared to regard it as a sort of game, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sincerely believe that these insects possess a sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">humor. Repeatedly they would let their burden fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a few feet of me, and I swear they actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned when they saw me jump hastily to one side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was hopeless to waste time and effort in trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">train the creatures, and I could foresee that if given</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive bombs, they were as likely to drop the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traptions upon their friends as upon their enemies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But if my ambitions in this direction were doomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be abandoned, my experiments had led to another idea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had observed that both the dragon-flies and bees</seg><seg type="columnLine">were natural retrievers, and would swoop with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of lightning, the moment an object that glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered was tossed into the air. I could not train the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures to obey my signals or my voice, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks had as little control over them as I had. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">by throwing objects into the air, I could bring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects dashing earthward. Hence, if when we attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reds, I could manage to throw missiles of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort into the air, my flying squadron would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooping down, and, seeing their friends fighting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red ants, they would undoubtedly fall upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave-owners with all the fury of their savage natures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile, the idea of using grenades and bombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still uppermost in my mind. We now had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient supply of saltpeter to make a large amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of powder, and I decided that most efficient bombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be made of pottery. By making globular ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sels with thick walls, and leaving a small orifice for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fuse, we would have fairly good substitutes for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old-fashioned spherical bomb-shells. Of course they</seg><seg type="columnLine">514</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be accurately timed, neither was it possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to arrange them to explode by concussion, for I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no fulminate and no means of making it. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not matter if a fuse spluttered and smoked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time after it fell among our enemies. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not know what it was, and would never dream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of attempting to extinguish the fuse. But there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">another and more important problem to be solved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Once we attacked the red ants, it would, I knew, be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand-to-hand fight and a general mel6e, and to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to throw grenades into the struggling mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be to kill and maim as many friends as foes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, if my bombs were to prove of any value, we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage to hurl them at the ants before the actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle began, and to do this, we must have some sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of engine or machine.	v</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Small grenades might be fired from bows by being</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted to the tips of arrows, much as grenades known</seg><seg type="columnLine">as "whizz-bangs" were fired from mechanical devices</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the Great War. But the larger ones, on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I counted most, would be far too heavy to be used in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way. The only device I could think of was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of catapault, and I spent many days experimenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and working on that idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under normal conditions, it would have been an</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy job to rig up a small catapault, but we had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">tool worthy of the name except my hunting knife, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the simplest undertaking became a stupendous matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">under such conditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But at last I had the satisfaction of seeing my crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair complete, and I was as delighted as a boy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his first gun when we tested the machine, and sent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dummy bomb sailing far over the tree tops. We could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not well use more than one of the things, and I con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tented myself with this first catapault. Meanwhile, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">army-ants were literally eating their heads off. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">black fellows had them in charge and allowed them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">roam about, always accompanying them and keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">them under control, in order to forage for themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a result, the country for miles about was stripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean of almost everything edible, and food became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious problem for us. But we were now nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to launch our attack and, in two days more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would start on our march for the red ants' stronghold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then all our plans were upset. Exhausted, terror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken, two of the blacks came rushing to our camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The red ants had made another raid; they had carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">off more of the savages as slaves, and had left scores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead and wounded behind them. Despite the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance made by the blacks and the good use they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made of the weapons we had supplied, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been overpowered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they had given a very good account of them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, and the reds had not gotten off unscathed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any means. For every black killed, at least two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raiders had been destroyed; but the odds in num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers had been overwhelming, the hereditary fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red ants had had its effect upon the savages, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having no leader and having been taken by surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had fought without order or system. Too late, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized my short-sightedness in not having posted</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouts to warn of such a raid. But there was no use</seg><seg type="columnLine">in lamenting that now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The allies on which I had counted the most had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">demoralized and decimated, but, to my surprise, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages, instead of being terrorized or anxious to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">further conflict, were all the more eager to even scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their foes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no use in waiting longer. The blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were eager to regain their fellows who had been made</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners, and to revenge themselves. Our army-ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be maintained in idleness indefinitely. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had a supply of bombs and our catapault, and I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to set off on our campaign at once. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chelonian Army, as I called it in honor of the turtles</seg><seg type="columnLine">we did not get, was a strange, weird organization; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangest army that eyes ever looked upon. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horde of brutal, ugly, naked, black savages--half</seg><seg type="columnLine">human, half-beasts; the swarming, blind, terrible-jawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexorable army-ants; the great hard-shelled, rapidly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving, metallic-hued Carib-beetles; the peaceful agri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultural ants, like ploughboys and farmers drafted into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a real army; our retinue of tame bombardier-beetles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tom and myself, while overhead buzzed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirred the dragon-flies and bumble-bees like scouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplanes. And never was there an army more difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">to control, to handle and to deploy. It would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad enough with the savages alone; but with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diversified units, each a law unto itself, each with dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct ideas, instincts and habits, the most experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">and efficient general on earth could not have pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented it from being chaotic. The Carib-beetles would</seg><seg type="columnLine">dash off after prey whenever they pleased. The blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">pranced and shook their weapons and uttered bestial</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The agricultural-ants were thinking far more of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">crops and fields than of military tactics. The dragon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies and bees flew here, there and everywhere, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the army-ants, under control of their savage mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters, moved steadily, irresistibly onward like well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained troops. I had strapped our catapault to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of our largest bombardier, another carried our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition and bombs, and these docile, domesticated</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts could be counted upon. Despite the seeming con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol exercised over the army-ants by the savages, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">little confidence in these blind scimitar-jawed creatures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tom was deadly afraid of them. Hence, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake of safety, and partly because they were to serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">as our shock-troops, the army-ants were in the advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the blacks behind them, and the agriculturalists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom, myself, and our cohorts of domestic insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing up the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LOOKING back upon it, I do not think' that any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the members of my army actually understood what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was all about, with the possible exception of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks. They, of course, had semi-human minds and an idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of revenge, of righting personal wrongs and of fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a principle. But the others were merely insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">with insects' minds and habits, and in the insect-world,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I doubt whether there are such things as vengeance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrongs or principles. Certain species are predatory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain species are not; some insects live on friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms with others; some are always at war. But all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is a condition of nature, a part of the Great Plan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as there are no family ties, no feelings of blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">relationship, no such emotion as affection among in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects, there can be no ideas of right and wrong, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance or of enmity, aside from natural inherited</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct. All warfare among insects, as far as I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed (and it makes no difference whether or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are tiny things'or giants creatures) is either in</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-defense or to secure food. Countless millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">larvie have been destroyed by ichneumons, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">butterfly or moth that develops from a larva which</seg><seg type="columnLine">has escaped bears no enmity towards the ichneumons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and has no fear of these terrible enemies of their kind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A wasp may swoop down and seize a spider, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiders never go out of their way to attack the wasps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Carib-beetle dashes in and seizes a victim from</seg><seg type="columnLine">among a busy colony of hornets, but the hornets never</seg><seg type="columnLine">take concerted action against the Carib-beetles nor at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack one whenever it is seen. I could mention thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">515</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of similar cases, but I must confine myself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">more important matters. And it was this lack of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true militant spirit, this entire absence of a true</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose, which I had not foreseen and which, I now</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel convinced, was our undoing. It must be remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered also, that we could not really communicate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of our allies with the exception of the semi-human</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages. To be sure, all the various members of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">army had thrown in their lots with us, but I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure now, that it was owing, not to a desire to destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red ants, but was due entirely to the strange hyp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">notic power of the blacks, and to the fact that Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself were, instinctively perhaps, regarded as</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings so superior that we were dangerous and must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be humored. Possibly, too, the agriculturalists felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were members of their colony, and as suchvmust be</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported, while their insect protectors accompanied</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as a matter of course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hate to record what transpired on that day. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given far too little credit for intelligence to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red ants. Perhaps they were apprized of our approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the swarm of dragon-flies and bees in the air. Pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly they had scouts posted in the forest. Perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some inexplicable instinct or intuition, they learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our proximity or again perchance it was merely the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that they had developed far more intelligence than</seg><seg type="columnLine">their relatives, and through countless centuries of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained by warfare and raiding, had developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">military instincts and tactics. I confess I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. All went well until we came close to the orchards</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the slave-owners. Before us the forest ended and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunlight streamed upon the clearing in whose cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tre was the red ants' citadel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The place seemed strangely quiet, strangely deserted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No slaves toiled under the watchful guardianship of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reds. Onward we marched. For a moment the army-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants hesitated as they reached the cleared space. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved their antennae about nervously, stroked one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, seemed perplexed, and then suddenly, wheeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly, they swung sharply to one side and hurried on</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from our objective. In vain the blacks strove</seg><seg type="columnLine">to control them. All their power over the creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have suddenly vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heedless of the fellows, the army-ants swept on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">course and presently were out of sight. I was amazed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunderstruck. What had so abruptly influenced them?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was there something about the red ants, as about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agriculturalists, which prevented the army-ants from</seg><seg type="columnLine">molesting them, prevented them even from trespass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on their domains? No doubt it was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sort, but I had no time to ponder on the causes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their desertion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The most powerful division of my army had van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, our forces had been deplorably reduced, and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no sign of the enemy. Quickly unlashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">our catapault, I fitted a bomb to it and hurled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">missile into the red ants' mound. The next instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">it exploded, and a cloud of smoke and sand flew up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the spot. This should bring the unsuspecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants swarming out, I thought. But still there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fign of life. Another bomb followed, and then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">perplexed, wondering, we started forward, a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage threw up his arms, uttered a terrified cry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished in the solid earth. Before I realized what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened, two more followed. Then a Carib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetle was swallowed by the earth, and a dozen agricul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turalists went with him. Scarcely had they vanished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when from every side came rushing the red warriors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bursting through the ground they had undermined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap us, they surrounded us, their great jaws clashing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their armor-clad bodies gleaming red as blood in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INSTANTLY the battle was on. Valiantly our agri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultural friends fought. Body to body, jaw to jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">they slashed, bit, wrestled with their red foes. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the savages they were, the blacks threw themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the melee. Clubs and swords swung, spears darted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows flew. No quarter was given and every man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and insect fought for himself. Had our forces equalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">or even approximated those of the red ants, we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have utterly routed them, perhaps annihilated them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they were three to our one, and despite the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantages of weapons, I knew our forces were doomed.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom and I were in the thick of it, but we had a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous advantage. We possessed explosives, and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time a red warrior or a group of warriors rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at us, we hurled a grenade with ghastly results. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way we managed to keep a cleared space about us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as fighting groups separated from the mass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our friends fell, we threw bombs into the knots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">victors and helped even scores. Had it not been for</seg><seg type="columnLine">these missiles, not one of us, I believe, would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped. As it was, the red ants, blown to pieces in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">groups and singly, unable to face this new form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle, overcome by the acrid fumes of the powder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to give way. Scores, hundreds lay dead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded all about. As many more lay writhing, help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, overcome by the sulphurous smoke. But the num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of dead and wounded agricultural ants and savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">was apalling. Few of the agricultural ants survived.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Over half the blacks had succumbed, and even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor-clad Carib-beetles had fallen before the maniacal</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury of the giant red ants. Only the great bees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragon-flies had escaped without great loss and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken little part in the fray. Once or twice a bee</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dashed down and had stabbed a red warrior with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its terrible sting. Once a dragon-fly had volplaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and had nipped off the head of a red ant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had triumphantly borne it aloft, to drop it, a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, into a struggling knot of fighters. And two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dragon-flies had fallen victims to their habit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashing after any bright object and to my bombs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swooping down as I hurled the missiles, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized them in mid-air, and, an instant later, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">blown to bits by the explosives. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As far as the red ants were concerned, the fight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. As quickly as they had materialized from no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, they vanished into their subterranean burrows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we were left alone with our dead and dying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only consolation in the whole miserable, disas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trous affair was that not one of our allies had shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear or had given way. There was no thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat in their minds, and so filled were they with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lust of battle, that both savages and agricultural</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants fell upon the dead and wounded reds and tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to pieces. And greedily, deliberately, the Carib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beetles gorged themselves upon the bodies of the fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a space I considered pushing onward and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroying the homes of the slave-holders. But I feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole area had been undermined, and I felt morally</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain that we would find no occupants within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">citadel. It was obvious that the red ants had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for us, that they had made the pitfalls to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trap us, that their warriors had lain concealed under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground until ready for the attack, and I had no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had provided for all contingencies and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed all their fellows and their slaves to some secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding place to keep them from falling into our hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">in case we were victorious. No doubt, too, the scent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hidden red warriors had aroused the suspicions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the army-ants, and had caused them to turn aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus avoid the pitfalls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout, the red ants had exhibited a high de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">516</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gree of intelligence and a knowledge of military tac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tics. We had been rather squarely outwitted, out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">generalled and beaten, and there was nothing to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done except to retrace our way to the colony of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agriculturalists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To return to our homes was more easily said than</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. Throughout our weary march we had to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way, for the red ants had closed in behind us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beset us on every side. Only the fact that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, so to speak, out of their element, saved us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter destruction. They were, however, insects, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open rather than of the jungles, and were accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fighting in clearings and not in dense growth. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had acquired a very great respect for our weapons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whenever we caught sight of a red warrior at a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, a discharge of arrows and missiles from Qui-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slings would end in victory for us, and I thanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iieaven that these creatures had not reached a stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of development that had enabled them to make use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other weapons than their powerful jaws and feet. Often,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, they would come unexpectedly rushing at us</seg><seg type="columnLine">from concealment, and desperate hand-to-hand duels</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ensue. But our black allies appeared rather to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoy fighting, now that they possessed weapons, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they took the keenest delight in bashing in the heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the red warriors or slicing through their attenuated</seg><seg type="columnLine">necks with their saw-edged swords. As for the agri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultural-ants, they appeared to take the whole affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a matter of course. In every respect, they always</seg><seg type="columnLine">have reminded me of yokels or farmers among humans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having the same dogged determination, the same bull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog persistency, the same methodical way of doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything--fighting included. They would plod along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most peaceful-appearing of creatures, until a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant would rush upon them, when--presto! they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">become fighting machines, alert, fearless; possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sort of calculating, calm ferocity that was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more terrible than sudden anger or rage. And, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than half the time, they would come off the victors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom and I had our share, also. To be sure, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior brains, our better weapons, and the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were more accustomed to the weapons, were all in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our favor. But on the other hand, the fearsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspect of these giant adversaries carried terror to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearts, and I always felt--though I am rather ashamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to admit it, a sort of superstitious dread of the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures; a sensation that I was fighting with some un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canny monstrous beings, not of this world. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">invariably felt chilly and shaky whenever one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reds rushed at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">npOM was even more affected in this way than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. He was deadly afraid of all the huge in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects, and of the ants in particular. Like all of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">race, he is extremely superstitious, and while he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">--by the greatest efforts of self control--overcome his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread of the agricultural ants, he still insisted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others were not real insects, but "jumbies." Moreover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his experience among the slave-owners had served to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make him still more afraid of the red ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he is not lacking in courage and will fight as</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately for his life as anyone. And it is a brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">man indeed who can stand up and face a monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-foot creature all shining chiton, with its six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed, many-jointed legs, its fierce, staring eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">its great clashing keen-edged jaws capable of biting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a human body in twain. Neither of us escaped without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scratch, however. Tom's body and limbs were cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with blood from cuts and slashes of the ants'</seg><seg type="columnLine">claws, and one beast had taken a good sized piece out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my shoulder. But I thanked God that his snapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws had missed my neck by the fraction of an inch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of our losses, however, were among the agricul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tural ants who fought with nature's weapons; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of the blacks were killed, others were badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded, and only the Carib-beetles and our bom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bardiers escaped unscathed. The former did good</seg><seg type="columnLine">work and more than once pulled down and destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">our enemies, while the latter, although for some rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son refusing to use their gas discharges at the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants, were most useful in giving us warning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave-owners lurking in ambush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a pitifully small remnant of my army that</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last reached the colony of agricultural ants, only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find that disaster had overtaken it during our unsuc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful foray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obviously the red ants had had full knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our activities, for I cannot convince myself that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mere coincidence, that the red ants had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colony by a roundabout route and had vented all</seg><seg type="columnLine">their savage fury upon it, while we were attacking their</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronghold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had slain for the mere lust of slaying, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed crops and harvested grain, had even entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burrows and galleries and had ruthlessly killed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquilines, the larvre and every living thing they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scarcely an agriculturalist remained alive and unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured, and, worst of all, we could not retaliate or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay off a few pf the scores, had we been able to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, for the raiders had completed their destruction, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had departed before we arrived on the scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the diligence and industry so typical of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind, the agricultural ants in my army instantly fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work repairing the damages to their galleries and</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes. Presently several went hurrying off and within</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour they returned leading a long column of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows, each bearing a burden of grain or corn. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was astonished. The messengers had gone to a neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boring colony, had besought aid in their extremity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fellows had come to their rescue. For hours the</seg><seg type="columnLine">string of ants came and went steadily, until enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">grain had been stored to supply all immediate needs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the neighbors did not stop there. Several hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred remained at the stricken colony and aided in</seg><seg type="columnLine">repairing damages, in starting new fields and in bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing order out of chaos. Even larva; were brought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">replace those killed or injured, and in an astonishingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">short time the colony, as far as outward appearances</seg><seg type="columnLine">were concerned, might never have been attacked. Surely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">among these creatures, a friend in need is a friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SINCE our defeat by the red ants, a most deplorable</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of affairs has developed. We have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven out by the agricultural ants and have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to take up our abode among the black savages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How strange are the ways of an inscrutable Providence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or of Fate. How strange a turn of the wheel of for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune that we should find our only friends and allies in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this vast land are the beings whom we so despised</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shunned, the beings who first showed hostility to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I cannot say and do not know why the agricultural</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants would not permit us to dwell with them longer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Provisions were short and it would have been a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time before the new crops were ready for harvesting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and meanwhile the larvse would have matured and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would have been far too many mouths to feed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps it was due to this fact, and a fear that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take some of the slender supply of provender</seg><seg type="columnLine">that induced them to get rid of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps it was due to the fact that they regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">517</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">us as responsible for the defeat by the red ants and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the following raid. Or perhaps they felt that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the primary cause of all the trouble with the slave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holders, and that they would not be free from future</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacks as long as we remained in the colony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whatever their reasons, we were soon made to un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand that we were no longer welcome guests. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned from a hunt to find all of our belongings</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved outside the walls. I wondered at this but did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not then realize what it meant, and Tom and myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">together with the two blacks (one had been killed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battle) patiently carried the things back to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut. A little later, several ants appeared and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking up our possessions and moving them again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still failing to take the hint, I seized our goods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had quite a tussle with the ants before I 1'ecovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Then, as if by preconcerted arrangement, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horde of the ants swarmed down upon us and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only bore all we owned outside the colony walls, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">commenced tearing our hut to bits before our eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one could mistake the hint, and dumbfounded, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood beside our few belongings like excited tenants in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a city; homeless, friendless and unable even to demand</seg><seg type="columnLine">an explanation. To be sure we could again camp in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forest as we had done at first. I also thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning to our cave in the mountain side. But some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, after dwelling for so long with the ants, we felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexpressibly lonesome and friendless and I felt more</seg><seg type="columnLine">miserable and disheartened than at any time since</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering the valley. But for the time being, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to do but to camp as best we might, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the help of the blacks--who still stuck by us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were most faithful, willing fellows--we gathered what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had, under a clump of trees, put up a rude shelter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spent a miserable night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But worse was to come. The agricultural ants, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned against us, had no intention of allowing us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vicinity, and it was barely light the next morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they appeared in force, and, by actions and man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, told us as plainly as in so many words to "move</seg><seg type="columnLine">on." They pushed and urged us, though without rough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness or violence, and despite my resentment and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">regret at thus being treated like a malefactor or other</seg><seg type="columnLine">undesirable, I could not but marvel at the ants' per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistence and bravery. Though they well knew our</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and the efficiency of our weapons, they laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of us and showed no signs of fear that we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">resist and fight. No doubt we could have inflicted</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious damages and killed many had we resisted, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I well knew this behavior would only make matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse. I had seen enough of the agricultural ants to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know they were determined, dogged, valiant fighters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an obstinate, bulldog persistency, and even if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat off the ants for the time, scores, hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, would take their places and, in all probability,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lives would be sacrificed for nothing. At all events,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no reason why we should remain in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot more than in another, and so, shouldering our</seg><seg type="columnLine">burdens, we left the ants and their colony and headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards our cave in the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our way led near the aphis-orchards of the blacks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as we neared these, the two savages with us</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed the greatest delight, evidently thinking we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were headed for their home. After all, I thought, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldn't we take up our abode near the black fellows?</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were degraded, filthy, brutal, little above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects in the scale of evolution, but they were, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, human.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We need not come into very close contact with them;</seg><seg type="columnLine">need not share their dens and food, any more than we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shared the quarters of the agriculturalists. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely, .If we had lived months with a colony of ants,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we should be able to exist among human beings, low</seg><seg type="columnLine">as these were. Moreover, here was cleared land and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could cultivate and raise crops, for we were sorely</seg><seg type="columnLine">in need of some food other than meat and the grain</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had obtained from our ant friends. In addition, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a greater interest in the blacks than I had before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battle, for they had exhibited a deal of bravery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had proven that they were capable of being trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">and educated, and I believed I might be able to do a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great deal towards uplifting them. Of course, I still</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in mind my scheme for blasting a way to free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom, but I had exhausted my supply of powder in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill-fated attack on the red ants, and weeks, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, would be required to accumulate a new sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply. Meanwhile I could keep my mind busy in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to educate and teach the savages, while finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would prove most useful in aiding us, by carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the sulphur and doing other heavy work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hence, considering these various matters, I turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside and headed for the stronghold of the black sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages, although as I neared their settlement I began to1-</seg><seg type="columnLine">have some doubts as to the reception they would accord</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. After the battle they had gone off, and while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two who were with us had remained faithful and</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly, I was not at all sure that the others might</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have grown resentful when they thought over their</seg><seg type="columnLine">losses, and might, therefore, treat us very much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the agricultural ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT I need not have feared any such developments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As we came in sight of the clearing, our blacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted and yelled, and instantly, out from their bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows swarmed a crowd of the savages. One glance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with wild whoops, and dancing and leaping like</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad things, they came rushing towards us. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting was vociferous, enthusiastic, and far too odor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous for comfort. But there was no doubt about our</seg><seg type="columnLine">being welcome here. To them we no doubt appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">as most superior beings (which I flatter myself we are)</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even though they had lost heavily in the battle, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">they must have realized that we were their friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had done our best to free them from the ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">present dread of their oppressors.' I was rather sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised that the red ants had not included the blacks'</seg><seg type="columnLine">village in their foray upon the agriculturalist. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I came to consider the matter, it was not sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prising. To have wrought havoc here would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">availed them nothing and would have greatly decreased</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ever available supply of slaves. Also, no doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they felt that we might fall upon their rear if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">delayed too long, and hence confined their attack to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the agricultural ants. Looking back upon it now, I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly certain that the red ants' attack on the agri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultural ants' colony was a most devilishly planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme to get rid of us. I believe the creatures rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soned that if they injured the agriculturalists, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter would blame us and would turn against us, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly as they did; and no doubt the red ants thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the agriculturalists would go to extremes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroy us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having made up my mind to remain temporarily, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, with the blacks, we lost no time in preparing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">suitable dwelling. With hundreds of hands to help us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was not difficult, and it was surprising how</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly our hut was built and how much easier it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to direct the savages than the ants. Here were beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">with whom we could at least converse after a manner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereas among the ants our sole means of communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation was by a most unsatisfactory lot of signs. More-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, low as they were, the blacks possessed semi-human</seg><seg type="columnLine">manners of thought and psychology, whereas, the ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">despite their intelligence and size, were, after all, out</seg><seg type="columnLine">518</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">r-nd out insects with insects' instincts, ideas and habits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">i;nd by no possible means could they ever acquire any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing approaching human intelligence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our house here was built of stones and clay, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a far better structure than was our former residence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ant-colony. It was at some distance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks' dwellings and pleasantly situated in the shade</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some large trees on the farther edge of the cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. By nightfall we were quite at home and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been comfortable enough had it not been for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly though rather unwelcome attentions of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage hosts. They insisted upon gathering about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought us innumerable offerings of aphis milk, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cayed insect meat and other things which they consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered delicacies, but which were nauseating to us. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried the weapons we had provided, and to my sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise and delight I discovered that they actually had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made duplicates of their own. Several had slings that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as serviceable, though more crudely made, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">those we had furnished; one or two had clubs which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wicked-looking things, though ungainly and cum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bersome, and one fellow had an apology for a bow with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, to my astonishment, he could shoot far more</seg><seg type="columnLine">accurately than with the bows I had made. Here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof positive that these miserable ape-like beings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">far more intelligent than I had surmised; they pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed an imitative instinct to a high degree, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition actually had a germ of inventiveness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingenuity in their dull brains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long, I wondered, would it take to raise these</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks to the plane of ordinary savage races? They</seg><seg type="columnLine">bred and matured so much more rapidly than other</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings, that I had no doubt that the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking to develop them would be far simpler and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quicker than with barbarous races possessing more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human attributes. In a way, it would be like</seg><seg type="columnLine">training anthropoid apes, creatures which, at four or</seg><seg type="columnLine">five years of age, are fully developed mentally and</seg><seg type="columnLine">physically, But on the other hand, would acquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits and characters be inherited? If so, with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid growth and increase, as much could be accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished in a few years, as in centuries with ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans. It was a fascinating idea, and my scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity to experiment along these lines was so thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughly aroused that I almost decided to delay attempt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to escape from the valley. But common sense over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruled scientific ardor. If I escaped, it would always</seg><seg type="columnLine">be possible to return and experiment to my heart's</seg><seg type="columnLine">content.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And what was to prevent me from taking our two</seg><seg type="columnLine">black adherents with me? They would prove most</seg><seg type="columnLine">useful on our long, dangerous return to civilization, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would provide most perfect subjects for scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation. Yes, when I made the attempt, I most</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly would try to carry our two savages along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE have been among the blacks for several weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and many new events have transpired which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think worth recording, although I am getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">woefully short of space in my notebooks. However, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst comes to worst, I can make a fair substitute for</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper from the inner bark of the seda virgin tree, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might even use parchment. But I still hope to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this valley before my paper is exhausted. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the savages even more quick to learn than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had expected or hoped. I have a number of them well</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained as agriculturalists, and they take as keen an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest in watching the plants sprout and grow as any</seg><seg type="columnLine">surburbanite in the springtime at home. Others I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taught to dress and cure skins; others to pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pare bark-cloth, and I have spent a good deal of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to teach the women to spin and weave the wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">cotton that grows here and also the silk from the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocoons. What a find this place would prove for silk</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacturers! Here are silk-worms a yard and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">in length, which spin cocoons containing thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of silk so strong and perfect that it could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound upon spools and used as thread without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also I have employed a large proportion of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fortifying this place, for I am sure that, sooner or</seg><seg type="columnLine">later and probably sooner, the red ants will raid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks in their customary manner. Although the sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages' settlement is admirably adapted for defense, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sufficient force could be held against a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of attackers, more especially now that we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">well provided with weapons, nevertheless we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have hoped to make a successful resistance. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">seldom that any great number of the denizens are</seg><seg type="columnLine">present during the day. They are obliged to be absent</seg><seg type="columnLine">tending their aphis-herds, cultivating the gardens we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have established, and attending to other duties, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an attack would find us short-handed. My first under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking was to surround the centre of the clearing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. These were not so much for defense--for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red ants could surmount any wall with ease--but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give our people the advantage of being able to hurl</seg><seg type="columnLine">missiles down upon the enemy, and so to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter at a disadvantage, as they scaled the defenses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a huge undertaking, but the blacks--though</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the least idea as to plans or purposes--took</seg><seg type="columnLine">childish delight in erecting the walls, and the place is</seg><seg type="columnLine">now completely encompassed by a strong stone, earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clay wall, nine feet in height and nearly six feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thickness. There are no openings in this, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks and ourselves enter and leave by means of lad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders which are drawn up, very similar in many respects</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the way in which the Pueblo Indians of our South-</seg><seg type="columnLine">western States protect their homes from attacks. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition, I have had a vast quantity of stones piled here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there along the summits of the walls. These can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be quickly rolled and hurled upon an enemy, and I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">also provided many roughly-made containers which are</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept filled with powdered sulphur, for I feel sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the giant red ants will be overcome by sulphur</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumes as quickly as are ordinary ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was while I was having this sulphur prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that another means of defense occurred to me. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to mine the area beyond the wall so that an at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacking force could be blown up at the proper mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. The red ants had demoralized us by their pit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls, but explosive mines would go them one better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The only trouble was to secure enough powder for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purpose. I had prepared quite a quantity of gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder since my arrival here and much of this I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in making grenades or bombs to be thrown from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall in case of an attack. But to make enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive to lay a series of mines would be next to</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible and would require many months of labor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if I did succeed and used the precious powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this purpose, it would mean that I would have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandon my hopes of blasting into the tunnel for nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a year. One .half the amount required to lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mines would be enough to blast down the tunnel door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hence I decided that the idea, excellent as it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not practical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a few days later a discovery we made com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely altered my viewpoint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the south of the aphis-orchards was a stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">country we had not previously explored. Several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had started in that direction, but each time some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had happened to prevent us from carrying out</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">519</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">our intentions. The first time it was the discovery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aphids that had sidetracked us. The next it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raid of the red ants upon the blacks, and at an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other time it was the discovery of a stream, which, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought we might divert to provide an ample supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water for ourselves and the savages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not a promising looking country from a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, and appeared to be a barren, sterile waste, much</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the desert of the tarantulas, but on a smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">scale. Beyond it, however, the mountains were very</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken and rough and their slopes were covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vegetation that appeared to be different from any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else I had seen in the valley. There really</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed no -valid reason for my desire to visit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, but very often I had little to occupy my mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and despite all my experiences, my scientific ardor for</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploration at times took possession of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We found the place even more of a desert than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarantula desert I have already described. The surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">was composed of jagged, broken rock and hard-packed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand with numerous low ridges of rock laid bare by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind, like the half-buried skeletons of some gigan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic pre-historic monsters. Not even cactus showed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waste, and I was about to turn back from the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidding spot when a shout from Tom drew me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "T'ank de Lord, Chief!" he exclaimed. "We dont</seg><seg type="columnLine">been have to go without salt no more, Chief. No, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just looka here 'bout. Here's salt a growin' in tha</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was pointing at small veins and outcrops of dull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitish crystals in a seam of the outjutting rock. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of salt had been most acute, and delighted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom had discovered the much needed mineral, I picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a few particleg and touched them to my tonuge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My first taste was enough. The sharp, bitter taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me instantly what it was, and while I was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointed at finding we must still go saltless, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">overjoyed at Tom's discovery. The material was salitre,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude nitrates much like those of the Chilean desert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but apparently far purer, and instantly I realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder-making henceforth would be an easy and simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No longer need we gather spoonfuls of nitrate crys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tals at a time from our rubbish piles. Here was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural deposit large enough to supply all our needs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more, and while I felt sure it was most crude and</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained many other chemicals, yet I felt certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if it proved unsuited for powder in its natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, it would not be difficult to clean and refine it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OUR trip to the desert had not been in vain, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering all we could carry of the stuff, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried back to our hut. I was eager to test the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of our new find and busied myself mixing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ingredients with the best salitre. The result was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not by any means as satisfactory as I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished. The powder, to be sure, exploded, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacked the power and rapidity of the powder I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitherto made. But this I was sure was due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impurities in the saltpeter and I set about experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menting at refining it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I racked my brains trying to recall all the details of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the process as I had seen it at the nitrate officinas in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chile, but not being a chemist, and lacking many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the essential requisites and apparatus, the best I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do was to put the mineral through a washing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recrystallization process.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The result of this was far better than I had hoped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The resultant saltpeter was even superior to that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had secured from the nitrarias, and the powder made</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it was the best we had produced. The next day</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we returned to the deposit accompanied by a dozen or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more blacks, and at the close of our labors, we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hundred pounds of the salitre ready for re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fining and use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was now no reason why I should not go ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all my plans to blast our way out of the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">and also, in the meantime, lay mines about our ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ritory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For days we worked like slaves, for I dared not mix</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder in large quantities and prepared the explosive</seg><seg type="columnLine">in small batches at considerable distances from one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Realizing that we might at any time be raided</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the slave-owners, the first lot of powder went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing my mines. These were earthenware jars filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with powder and buried a foot beneath the sand, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with powder-trains leading to convenient spots within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall. I had found it so difficult to make reliable</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuses, even of short lengths, for my grenades, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned the idea of using fuses for the mines, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead laid conduits of bamboo sections under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the earth and scattered a powder-train *</seg><seg type="columnLine">through these. I was so anxious to prove the efficiency</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my mines that as soon as the first one was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, I touched fire to the end of the powder train.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almost instantly the mine exploded with a roar, send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a shower of stones and sand high in air. For an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant the savages threw themselves down, fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaking with terror. Then, as they realized that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not harmed, and I tried to explain the purpose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mines, they leaped up, howling and shouting, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they had actually seen their enemies blown to</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a number of the mines laid about the clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I felt we were fairly safe from a successful at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack by our enemies, and turned all my attentions to</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacturing enough powder to blast down the gate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the tunnel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This I knew would be a far more difficult undertaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to blow a few hundred pounds of sand into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, and I used the greatest care to mix the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gredients to produce an explosive of high power. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course the resultant powder was miserable stuff com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared to ordinary commercial gunpowder or blasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder. But what it lacked in quality I could offset</seg><seg type="columnLine">by quantity and, having done my best I decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">test the result upon solid stone. This was somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult for there were no large masses of stone near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blacks' homes and I wished to make a thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical and convincing test, for upon the results our</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom and, probably our lives depended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The best and most available spot where this could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, was on the rocky mountain side, and carrying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly large supply of the best powder, Tom and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started off. After a short search, we found a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of rock practically identical with that of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel door was composed, and with a small deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">fissure running across one outjutting mass. Into this</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack we forced and rammed several pounds of powder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tamped it with sand and clay, laid a fuse, and touch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fire to it, beat a hasty retreat. Several moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed. I began to fear my fuse had gone out or</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the powder had failed, and was on the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping forward to investigate, when there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific report, and bits of broken rock rained about us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rushing forward, we found a mass of stone weighing</seg><seg type="columnLine">several tons had been dislodged and cracked. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys, Tom and I locked arms and danced and pranced</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. Our powder was a huge success. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt that we could force the tunnel door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape from the valley, and we saw freedom near</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All we needed was enough powder to insure tearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">520</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">down the door at the first blast, for if we merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracked or moved it slightly, our own efforts might</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeat us. A bad crack which would not permit us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cscape might render it impossible to place a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast properly and might very probably form apertures</seg><seg type="columnLine">or openings through which the exploding gases could</seg><seg type="columnLine">cscape without exerting any force upon the rock itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So, satisfied that our powder was all that we required,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we hurried home and made preparations to produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of the explosive to shatter the stone portal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments. We worked with light hearts and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater enthusiasm than at any time since we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered this place. At last we were on the road to</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom and we laughed and joked and made plans for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our futures as though we were already quit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley. In a few days the place, with its gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect inhabitants, its terrifying creatures, its strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-inscct-like savages, and its ancient ruins of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown white race, would be merely memories of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past. We would have our black servitors and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive weapons and garments to assure us it wa3</seg><seg type="columnLine">not all a dream. In a few weeks we would be far</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond Tupec and approaching the outskirts of civili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zation, and within six months we would be back in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of electricity, radio, motor cars and modernities</seg><seg type="columnLine">where our adventures would appear so unreal and fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastic, that they would seem, even to ourselves, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figments of imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL went well. Our powder-making progressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly and no signs of the red raiders caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">us any uneasiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We transported our explosive to the tunnel entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and examined the massive door minutely in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">locate the best spot in which to place our blast which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to prove our open sesame. It was a difficult mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter to find such a spot. The door was perfectly fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not a crevice or crack showed into which we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope to ram enough powder to even shake the portal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time I began to think that I was to be balked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this late stage and I wondered how I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so stupid as to have failed to investigate, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to all my trouble and making all my plans. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I remembered that when we had passed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door there had been quite a high step from the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tunnel to the earth outside. Of course the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the door must fit against this ledge cut in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, and if I could somehow manage to get some</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder between the door and this inside sill, the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion would probably force the door open even if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not crack or break it. With this idea giving me</seg><seg type="columnLine">renewed hope, Tom and I set to work digging away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth about the lower edge of the massive stone. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked feverishly, as if our lives depended upon it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a fairly short time had scraped away enough of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand and earth to expose the living rock below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel mouth. As I had hoped, there was a fairly wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack between the door and the sill behird it, a crevice</seg><seg type="columnLine">as wide as my thumb, and by inserting sticks in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">and probing about, I found that the crevice extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward for nearly a foot and narrowed until the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sill fitted tightly together at the upper limit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack. To push powder up into this opening was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow and difficult job, for it kept dropping out as fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we put it in. But I solved the problem at last by</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapping the powder in packages of thin papery bark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after each was in place, puncturing the covering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was in fact the same method that was used in load-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing big cannon, and by the end of the afternoon we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stowed fully fifty pounds of powder between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and the solid rock behind it. By the time this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tamped and the fuse laid, it was dark. Well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied with our day's labors and with every expecta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of being out of the accursed valley before an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other sun had set, we started back towards the sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages' clearing. Half way there, and at almost the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exact spot where the blacks had first attacked my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians, we were met by a knot of wildly excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">blacks led by our two special friends. They were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited and appeared so terrified that I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">make head or tail of what they said. All I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather was that ants had come to the village. Think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that the red ants' raid was under way, Tom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I dashed forward as rapidly as our weary muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">would permit, while about us, and urging us on, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gibbering blacks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as we came within sight of the place there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither sign nor sound of battle, although I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds of the savages gathered upon the wall. Hurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing forward, and wondering what all the excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about, we clambered up the ladder. Even then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not understand what was the matter. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom, who was far more proficient than myself in in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terpreting the so-callcd dialect of these creatures, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last grasped their meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He do say the ants been come," he exclaimed. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">say a-plenty come this side an, show himselfs an' not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been make fight. He say they over yander behin' we</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. They don' been tha monstrous red ants, chief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They been tha farmer specie an' they desire to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with yo', chief."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What, I w&lt; idered, had caused the agricultural ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come here? Why did they wish to see me? How had</seg><seg type="columnLine">they made their wants understood by these savages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and why did they remain hidden over by our hut? At</seg><seg type="columnLine">any rate it was a relief to find it was no murderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">slavers' raid, and feeling sure the agricultural ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on a peaceful mission, I hurried down the lad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and across the clearing to our hut. As I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to it, a score of most fearful, terrible-appearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures suddenly appeared from where they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">concealed. So monstrous and dangerous did they look</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I uttered an involuntary cry and leaped back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">expecting to be attacked and destroyed the next in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant. No insects I had yet seen had been so formid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able in appearance. Unquestionably they were ants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they were little more than living, gigantic, ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated jaws and powerful clawed legs. Their bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">were slender, attenuated and lithe, their motions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so rapid, the eye could scarcely follow them, and yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow, somewhere, they bore a strange familiar re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblance to something else. All this rushed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">my brain in the fraction of a second. Then, among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creatures appeared several agricultural ants, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly the solution of the mystery flashed upon me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The monsters were agricultural ants! Not the ordinary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard-working, peaceful creatures we had known, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly specialized fighting units; ants developed, trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed--Heaven alone knows how--by some treatment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the larvie until, just as special treatment of a bee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grub results in a queen, the larvse, instead of becom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ordinary workers, had become veritable warriors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What amazing, incredible super-intelligence the agri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culturalists must possess to have done this! Here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibited reasoning powers equal to those of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings. They had suffered at the hands or rather at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jaws of the red ants. They had realized that to</seg><seg type="columnLine">successfully combat trained warriors, they must also</seg><seg type="columnLine">have warriors and, casting aside all the age-old habits</seg><seg type="columnLine">and traits of countless generations of their species,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had produced a race of super-fighters. In a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">generations, perhaps in one generation, they had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped physical characters totally distinct from those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the normal agriculturalists. How I wished I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">521</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had these fellows with me on our attack upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red ants. But it was too late to think of that now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tomorrow I would be out of the valley forever; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants could fight it out and be the masters of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own destinies, and the blacks would have to work out</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own salvation. But why, I wondered, had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agricultural ants brought their newly evolved warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me? What was their idea? Did they wish me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to their colony or was it a threat?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was not left long in doubt. Our two blacks pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed an uncanny faculty for understanding these</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants and now, in their scarcely intelligible, half-human</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingo, they explained that the agriculturalists had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to offer their services in repelling and destroying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red ants. They had driven off a foray of the slave</seg><seg type="columnLine">owners in a second attack made by the latter, apd now</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had come to volunteer their services as allies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the blacks. No doubt, if the reds again attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages, these terrible fighters would prove most</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable aids, but I could not see that it was of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest to me. I was through with them all, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">within twenty-four hours I would be beyond reach of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reds or any others. I tried to appear nonchalant, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it understood that I was in no need of rein-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcements, but I did not care to make known my</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans for tomorrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so here we are, Tom packing our few belong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings ready to take with us; myself writing these last</seg><seg type="columnLine">few lines of the record I have kept for so many many</seg><seg type="columnLine">months--or is it years--and, outside our hut, the newly</seg><seg type="columnLine">created warriors herded, if I may use the term, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their agricultural fellows, for so specialized have these</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters become that they cannot feed themselves but</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be fed by the others. Moreover, they are prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically devoid of antennae, these organs having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduced to mere rudiments in order to give room</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their awful mandibles, and as a result they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be moved and handled like so many automatons. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder why on earth they insist upon remaining here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The savages have not taken them into their village and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to be rather in fear of the creatures. They act</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all the world as if they were keeping some sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a watch over Tom and myself; as if they suspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were planning to leave the valley and were ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prevent us from going. Heaven help us if that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their minds, though why they should care whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">we left or not, after evicting us from their colony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is beyond my comprehension. Anyway, tomorrow will</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle the question. By the end of another day we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will either be outside the valley or torn to pieces, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am determined that no beings here shall interfere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my plans as long as I am able to lift a hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent any interference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOW futile are man's best laid plans. Another day</seg><seg type="columnLine">has passed since last I wrote. How glibly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated that before another sun had set we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be out of this valley. How confidently I stated that vve</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be either free or torn to pieces. Yet we are still</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, and as yet unharmed. Rapid and unexpected</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been the astounding events that have taken place</seg><seg type="columnLine">within these past twenty-four hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I know only too well why the warriors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agricultural ants refused to move away; why they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. Faithful fellows they have proved, friends to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last even though they did drive us from our home</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them. Would that I might have been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicate with them, to understand them fully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must hurry on. A battle is impending. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget, things so plain to me may be a puzzle, a mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery to everyone, if anyone ever should read these notes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This morning--though it seems much longer--one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black aphis-herders came dashing in from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">groves, terror upon his face. Even I grasped his mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The red ants were approaching. The long ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected raid was about to take place. Almost at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time several agricultural ants came rushing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clearing. Hurrying from one to another of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows, they whistled and touched antennae. Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly the crowd of warriors was upon the move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never have I seen better disciplined, better drilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">troops. As if with one accord they formed into columns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each led by the workers, and wheeling, deployed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up their stations about the clearing. I was as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tounded. Beyond doubt the agriculturalists had known</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a raid was being planned; unquestionably they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to us to aid us in repelling the attack; obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had posted scouts to keep them informed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements of the reds. But while I appreciated their</seg><seg type="columnLine">acts, their friendliness and their value, yet they hin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered and hampered my own plans. I had counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my mines, and these allies were now stationed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the hidden explosives. To set them off when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reds were attacking would be to destroy a3 many</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends as enemies. In vain I tried to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors move. In vain I endeavored to explain, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were mere fighting machines endowed with life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures understanding, knowing only battle and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulation of their huge jaws. It was useless. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">only hope was that when the reds attacked, the agricul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turalists would fall back, that my new Chelonean army,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I called it, would slowly retreat before the reds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take its final stand close to the wall. Upon the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would be useless. Their sole weapons were their</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaws and to use these they must come to grips with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As far as we were concerned, all was in readiness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no fear of the ultimate outcome. Our combined</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces, our defences, those terrible specially developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors would destroy the power of the slave-holders</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hours passed. I had begun to think there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a false alarm, when, among the trees of the aphis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orchards, we saw the advancing host of red ants. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped. There were thousands, tens of thousands, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed. They were everywhere; they came from every</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And they showed no signs of making an immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack. I wonder if they are besieging us, if they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some devilish scheme of which we are ignorant? They</seg><seg type="columnLine">first appeared three hours ago. I have had all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subterranean galleries destroyed so they cannot enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the tunnels opening in the aphis-orchard. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stationed blacks below ground to destroy any red who</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens to dig his way through. But I am beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fear for the result of the battle, if battle it is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. I have talked it over with Tom, I have pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that no matter what happens, if one of us is killed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded or captured, the other must make his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the tunnel, blast the door open and escape. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the survivor to remain here alone would be unthink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. I hope and pray that such an eventuality will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not arise; but we must be prepared. I have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom promise, though with great difficulty, that if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall he will take charge of my notebooks and leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley and make his way to civilization or die in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attempt.

You never commented on my suggestion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We gave it a trial! We are always willing to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything! At first it looked as though it might work:</seg><seg type="columnLine">it really was a beautiful piece of machinery. All our</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had to do was to talk into a receiver and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound was transmitted to the machine, transformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into mechanical activity and the letter was finished a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second after the dictation ended. As I remember the</seg><seg type="columnLine">details, the machine was entirely automatic, had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper feeder and discharged the letter into one tray</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the carbon into another. As a machine, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect, but it could not think, consequently, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many words that could not be used--for example, to--</seg><seg type="columnLine">too--two--three different words, three different mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, but only one sound for the three. Another diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty was in the matter of pronunciation. In adjusting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine you used an actor who is credited with</seg><seg type="columnLine">having a wonderful voice and speaking perfect Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish. Unfortunately, in our office we have men from</seg><seg type="columnLine">every part of the United States and many foreigners</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have had to learn English. All of our men spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">English, but they all had a different accent, and none</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke as perfectly as the actor. The machine typed</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly what they spoke, but the letters it produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">were certainly queer affairs. I was sufficiently inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in the proposition to invite the actor to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dictate for us, and the letters he produced were</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect, so long as he was careful in not using words</seg><seg type="columnLine">with two meanings."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You could have had the machines adjusted to suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the different accents," replied Billings in a rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritated voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly.

Dr. Billings and his subordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">" nates studied the race of stenographers. He found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that practically every statement that Jerome Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made about them was correct. Those who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable ceased to be mere stenographers and filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">offices of trust as private secretaries. They ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">function as mere letter writers. Many married. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull ones remained dull. Gaps in the ranks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily replaced by very ordinary material from busi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ness colleges. Replacements were frequent and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yearly turnover large. The average office worker was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly capable but absolutely undependable. Most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them had ambitions and day dreams, but these did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not extend in the direction of writing a perfect letter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A few grew old in the service, but most changed oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupations before twenty-five. Socially, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle class, poorly housed, inadequately fed, but rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">elegantly dressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Billings worked and studied and yet failed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see how the work could be more efficiently performed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His inability fretted him. His pride was hurt, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in addition, he was faced with the loss of his position</seg><seg type="columnLine">in case he failed to satisfy his employer. Worry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous strain and overwork produced insomnia. Fi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nally tired, nature demanded sleep, and in 'this slumber</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a dream from the subconscious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From a high balcony he overlooked in his dream an</seg><seg type="columnLine">office where, several hundred stenographers were work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at noiseless machines. He could tell from the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued intensity of their labor and the satisfied ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression on their faces that they were happy in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Someone put an opera glass in his hands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he focussed on one individaul after another. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once impressed with the intelligent faces and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous, capable hands--large strong hands; long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wonderful fingers, racing surely over the key-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boards. In his dream he watched them, hour after</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, as they wrote letters--and he knew, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading, that they were writing perfect letters at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Waking with a start and shivering, he turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light. Unable to forget those hands, he placed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own between the light and the calcined wall, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge extremities appear as shadows with twisting men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acing fingers. Then he went to sleep, and the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, after shaving more carefully than usual, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called to see Jerome Smith; and in spite of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts, it was the scientist who was excited this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not the capitalist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without preamble or delay, he blurted out the mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velous solution, which had come to him after his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will secure better stenographers by breeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">theml"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The astonished leader of finance could only stammer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"W--w--what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Breed them!" repeated the scientist.

That is the solution to your question."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerome Smith remained silent for many seconds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even though he was accustomed to tremendous prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lems, this was almost too much for his intelleot to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp. Finally he asked, almost in a whisper:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how can you breed them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is simply a matter of detail, technique, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for your experimental station to work out.

Yet, I will give you the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">outline of my plan. You appreciate the fact that most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your stenographers are women. When they marry^</seg><seg type="columnLine">they mate with artisans, salesmen, street car con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductors, occasionally with a business man, but never</seg><seg type="columnLine">with another stenographer. I understand you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ten thousand stenographers in your employ;</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually replace five thousand of the dull ones with</seg><seg type="columnLine">five thousand male typists, the best you can find in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire world.

Do not let them marry unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">they both pass certain examinations for speed and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fection of copy. Give an extra bonus for every child</seg><seg type="columnLine">born. Have a community hospital, day nursery, kinder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garten, and school. Thus the mothers can soon return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their office, but the children will remain under your</seg><seg type="columnLine">control. From their youth they will be taught stenog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raphy and typewriting: they will be made to live</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their machines. As soon as they are efficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, put them to work in your offices. Make them</seg><seg type="columnLine">independent of their families. From the first; control</seg><seg type="columnLine">their twenty-four hours' activity. Always they will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stenographers--encourage them to marry stenographers</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and breed stenographers.

Eventu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, these specially bred stenographers will be doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">full duty at six and marrying at eight. I do not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve we should force nature beyond that point. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty years, sufficient results will be obtained to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the experiment profitable. I thoroughly believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">five generations of such intensive breeding will yield</seg><seg type="columnLine">a race of stenographers who are able to produce the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finest of work and absolutely incapable of doing any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JEROME SMITH shivered. The idea, for some rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, was distasteful to him--and he said so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I admit that the average stenographer is rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor material, but they are human beings, Dr. Bill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings: I can hardly reconcile myself to your idea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientist, however, was unable to brook opposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. "But it is for their own good, Mr. Smith! If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were just selfish in the matter, it would be dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent. You said yourself that their life was unhappy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unsatisfactory. You insisted that they had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">future that was worth while--that few of them could</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance. Your idea was that they were poorly fed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly housed and that their sexual life was inadequate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unsatisfactory. If you follow my plan, you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make them comfortable and happy. Once they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">bred to be capable stenographers, they will not want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do anything else. They will be able to attain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest satisfaction in their work. They will only be</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy when taking dictation, and transposing it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">type. Their motto will be, 'Efficiency plus Content-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.' No doubt, the time will come when we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a new generation born every ten years; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every child will be born with the inherited desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a perfect stenographer. If it works, you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow out the same plan with your other workers, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that,is for the future to decide. You will be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to secure a great advantage over your competitors. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty years, Universal Utilities will control the market</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world--In two hundred years, you can have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">specially bred line of workers. I can see that finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">your organization could so breed workers that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be willing to work for no other reason than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pleasure they had in it, or because they were forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to by the inherited urge. That is the picture of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. We need only make a start."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But won't they object? Can they.be controlled?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Certainly! At first they won't realize what is hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pening--all they will know is that they are being well</seg><seg type="columnLine">housed, excellently fed and beautifully clothed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes in the generations will come gradually. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the realization comes, it will be too late to resist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They will have only one ambition then--one primitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">urge--to write perfect letters. Then they will only</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to sleep and eat and work. All initiative will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone except the desire to take dictation and write</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect letters. They will be machines, but human--</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will know the difference between to and too and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. Can they be controlled? Why, Mr. Smith, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only strike you will ever have will come when you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to supply them with work!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Jerome Smith, President of Universal Utilities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finally convinced. He was big enough to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was only a small part of an organization that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">some day control the destinies of the world, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hold in its grip the commerce of a universe. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">small man might plan for a generation, but a big man</seg><seg type="columnLine">would arrange a programme that would carry on in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every detail a thousand years after his death. Alex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ander might make Macedonia famous for a generation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but William the Conqueror would found an Empire</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would grow greater for a thousand years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jerome Smith looked into the future. He saw an</seg><seg type="columnLine">organization, an office force that functioned perfectly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sales organization of five thousand trained men, dic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tating to ten thousand errorless stenographers. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">526</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">visioned a constant flow of perfect, beautiful letters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaming in every direction from the central offices</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all parts of the world, bringing in a volume of busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that was the envy and despair of his rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakening competitors. But he saw more than this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his factories he saw specially bred workers, working</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly with skilled hands, perfectly co-ordinated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly developed brains. He wondered if the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle could be applied to other departments of Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versal Utilities--if salesmen could be bred to trail the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uninterested customer with the unflagging interest of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-hound. Whether even the higher executive offices</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be filled with specially bred managers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Realizing that time meant nothing, if only in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end the results were satisfactory, he gradually thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in terms of Universal Utilities, rather than in units of</seg><seg type="columnLine">isolated humanity. Everything must be sacrificed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the organization. The individuals were of no value.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, he considered them simply as pawns on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chess board, things hardly human, living in human</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape but somehow not worthy of sympathetic regard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The more he thought about the breeding of capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">stenographers, the more he felt that the end result</seg><seg type="columnLine">justified the means employed. He even reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point where, in his grandiose pride, he felt that, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a true creator, he was changing something useless into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing of beautiful utility. Without further delay, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the necessary orders. The final arrangements</seg><seg type="columnLine">were made easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Universal Utilities manufactured everything neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary for the building and equipment of the suburban</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes; the arrangement of a new salary scale and</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of bonuses was also easy. The hard part was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find five thousand competent unmarried male stenog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raphers to take the place of the five thousand incapable</seg><seg type="columnLine">females who were to be discharged. Yet, even this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally done--social centers were organized--every op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity was given the ten thousand young people to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend their spare time with each other, thus encourag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing matrimonial possibilities in every way. As a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult, six thousand of the stenographers were married</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a year and another two thousand at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen months. Those who refused to marry were</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharged and their places filled by younger and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">socially inclined typists. As fast as they married,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each couple was given a comfortable home in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the apartments in the new community centers. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">generous system of bonuses made the birth of a child</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unqualified pleasure rather than a foreboding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disastrous poverty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Such a programme could not be kept a secret. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, Universal Utilities used it as one of their most</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking advertisements--not only to bring their firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">into world renowned fame as unselfish philanthropists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but also to attract to their employ the most skillful</seg><seg type="columnLine">office workers from all over the business world. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">several Sundays the leading newspapers ran long ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertisements in their Magazine section. One was</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      SKILLFUL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        TENOGRAPHERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         EEK</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">        UBURBAN HOMES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "Universal Utilities promotes health and happiness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  among its office force by encouraging its employees</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  in every way to lead normal lives.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, many more children were born than were either</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected or necessary for the continuation of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment, which both Dr. Billings and Jerome Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">were watching with the greatest interest. When, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of five years, the scientist reported to the Corpor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation president that there were now over ten thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">specially bred stenographic children, he anticipated his</seg><seg type="columnLine">employer's question by ending his report with the state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Under the present conditions of life in the sten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ographic centers, there is no doubt but that there will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be many more children born and raised to maturity</seg><seg type="columnLine">than there will be needed to carry on the experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end of eighteen years. This is really a neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary part of the programme, especially in the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">generations of breeding. There will be many children</seg><seg type="columnLine">who will not be true to type. Later, we hope, by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of carefully conducted measurements, to eliminate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unfit at a very early age. Even now we believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that much can be told by the shape of the hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length of the fingers. In this generation, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain number of the children will resemble their</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandparents more than their parents. We feel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we shall have to have thirty thousand children born as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as possible in this generation in order to be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ten thousand adults who are perfect enough to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the experiment. Realizing the necessity of having</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many children born as closely together as possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are now giving an extra bonus to stenographers who</seg><seg type="columnLine">are twins. In this first generation, we will begin at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once to teach stenography and typewriting in the pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mary grades, and we believe, that by the time the chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren reach the age of ten, we shall be able to pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">out one-third of them as giving promise of special</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and accuracy. These will be trained in separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">schools, while the duller ones will gradually be isolated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the course of years, be amalgamated with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary city workers. I might add also that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">special diet is working favorably; all the children are,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the average, two years in advance of the ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">child in size, weight and intelligence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nnWENTY years passed and eighty per cent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">-*■ old stenographers were retired on a liberal pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. being replaced in the offices of Universal Utilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the first generation of specially bred and highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">educated office workers. One out of every four of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">children in the first generation had been able to pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">the necessary tests. These had been sent to special</seg><seg type="columnLine">schools where the entire time was spent on spelling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">punctuation, grammar, stenography and typewriting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the age of fourteen, they were working in experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental offices, while at fifteen they were being given</seg><seg type="columnLine">positions in the main offices of Universal Utilities. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rule, they were fine specimens of manhood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">womanhood, having been given the best of care in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every way since their birth. Irrespective of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability they possessed, none in this generation were</seg><seg type="columnLine">given positions unless they manifested genuine love</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the work. Records were carefully kept and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">precaution taken for the continuation of the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the death of Jerome Smith and Dr. Billings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While the actual details of the proposed reform were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only known to a few of the higher officials, still it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">generally understood that Universal Utilities was sold</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the idea: that the business success of the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay in perfect letters, written by errorless stenog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raphers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In such a company, more like a machine than an</seg><seg type="columnLine">organization of human individuals, events moved with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the regularity of clockwork. Jerome Smith at seventy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">STENOGRAPHER'S HANDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">527</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">five was still watching the daily curve of errors which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was placed routinely on his desk. With grim satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion he saw the line indicating the volume of business</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the daily number of letters rise steadily towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peak that could not even be estimated, while at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time the number of errors per stenographer per</seg><seg type="columnLine">day was steadily falling. This record was carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched and the results published. A definite scale of</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance in salary was the reward for weeks and months</seg><seg type="columnLine">of perfection. Some stenographers were able to go an</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire month without spoiling their record. The per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect stenographer had not yet been born, but a won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful advance was already apparent. The gain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed was as remarkable as the improvement in ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curacy. Special inventions had to be devised in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to allow the typewriters to respond rapidly enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flying fingers. It was even found advisable 'to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vise an automatic paper feeder so that the typist would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have to stop to insert a fresh sheet of paper. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch on the button put in a piece of correspondence</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, while pressure on a different button inserted an</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It might seem that with the increasing speed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater accuracy, the correspondence of Universal Utili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties could be carried on with five thousand office work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers instead of ten thousand. The truth was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten thousand stenographers were doing ten times as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much work as the same number had accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty years before. The business had correspondingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased. The carefully kept charts showed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment was paying for itself in every way. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third generation was born, there was a smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent to be discarded--the result of the intensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeding was beginning to show. As an old man, aged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in body but still active in mind, Dr. Billings in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">annual report to his employer, Jerome Smith, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interesting statement:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the fifth generation, we are finding less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen per cent of the babies who are not running</seg><seg type="columnLine">true to type."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO hundred years passed. Universal Utilities, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">governed by Hiram Smith, descendent of Jerome</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith, ruled the financial world. During that two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years, the basic principle that "better letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce better business" had never been forgotten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were new ways of reaching the ultimate con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumer: the radio constantly endeavored to furnish new</seg><seg type="columnLine">contacts, salesmen in monoplanes reached every small</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, but still the great bulk of the business all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world had to be carried on by correspondence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that correspondence, carried on by Universal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Utilities, was now approaching a state of wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfection. Errors might be made in dictation, ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dresses might be wrong, but a mistake made by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten thousand stenographers, was now so unusual that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heads of departments were always inclined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame the mistake on the other portions of the official</seg><seg type="columnLine">force. Year after year the stenographers approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the perfection of beautifully adjusted machinery, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this difference: they could think, reason, evaluate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">differentiate. To their finely co-ordinated muscles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">added harmonious and specially trained minds. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">most important of all was the pleasure that they took</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their work. They were content only when working,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were happy only in the office. Nothing but severe</seg><seg type="columnLine">illness might keep them from their machines. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes were simply miniature offices, where they talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the work of the day, helped their children write</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters and vied with each other in speed contests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The increased love for their work influenced their</seg><seg type="columnLine">social contacts. Those who were recognized as being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety-nine per cent efficient hesitated in seeking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">society of the eighty-five per centers. An unmarried girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was ninety-seven per cent perfect in accuracy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed was willing to keep company only with a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who was as brilliant as she was--she certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not consider matrimony with one who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated at ninety per cent. Their one track minds ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consider personal wealth, beauty, fame or sexual</seg><seg type="columnLine">allure as reasons for marriage. All they could think,</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk and dream of was their work and the possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some one, some time, working a whole year without</seg><seg type="columnLine">making an error.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sundays and holidays were observed but were always</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by days of increased production, as the ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand workers carefully rested, avoided every form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fatigue during their hours off duty, and in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">way conserved their energy for the hours of produc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion following the holidays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One afternoon Hiram Smith was entertaining a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady in his office. In fact, it was his daughter, recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned from one of the most fashionable colleges in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Massachusetts. Hiram Smith was disturbed, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he tried to conceal his annoyance. His only</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter, in fact, his one and only child, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismissed from college on account of complete failure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make the necessary grades. The father had tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep her in college, but even his great wealth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual power had been insufficient to bribe the Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent of the college, who had simply saicPthat the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young lady was unwilling to study and could not stay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing in the general appearance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">late collegian to indicate mental deficiency.

"Is this the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">you welcome your only-only?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have disgraced me!" Hiram Smith replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only my position has kept it out of the afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers. All of New York knows about it.

Now each clerk is connected by telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a stenographer, and as fast as a letter is dictated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is written. Some of our men talk at the rate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred and fifty to two hundred words a minute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we have never found one who could talk faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">than one of our average stenographers could vwrite.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our business is a peculiar one, and we take great' pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our letters. They have to be absolutely individualis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic. For over one hundred years we have tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid the semblance of anything like a form letter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When John Jones of Honolulu receives a letter from us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is a highly personal one from Universal Utilities to</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Jones. He likes it. Our millions of customers</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it. We are able to establish an individual contact</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our customers stay with us. We have the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided into ten thousand districts, and the mail from</seg><seg type="columnLine">each district is answered by a man we have familiarized</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that particular district; a man who is keenly alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the special needs of the people, who seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">his neighbors. He understands their habits, thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reactions. Of course, we write letters in many</seg><seg type="columnLine">languages, but eighty-five per cent of all our corre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spondence is conducted in English. We try to answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">every letter within two days of the time it is received.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course, some days are very heavy--Mondays and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the days following holidays for instance--but we never</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall very far behind. Each one of these ten thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter clerks dictates eight hours a day. There is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen minute rest period after every forty-five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of work and an hour off at noon--a fairly long day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A/T IRA BELLA SMITH looked with interest around</seg><seg type="columnLine">-'■VA the room.

"Here you will find five hundred glass enclosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms in a similar arrangement, but in each of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms is a stenographer, connected in every instance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a letter clerk. They each have one of our noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, self-feeding electrical machines, which automati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally discharge the letters, with envelopes attached,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into wide tubes. These letters are then carried by</seg><seg type="columnLine">endless conveyors back to the dictator, who takes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen minute rest period to sign the letters he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">dictated in the previous forty-five minutes. All he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do is to sign them as they come to him, and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other machine blots them, folds and seals the envelope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the fifteen minutes he is thus occupied, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">special stenographer sits motionless, eyes closed, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laxing every muscle, ready to spring into intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity, when the dictating again begins. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have some stenographers, who still take dictation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in shorthand, but only from the higher officers, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not learned to dictate at the high speed neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to make the most of this highly trained mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical ability."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mirabella looked at her father as he closed this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentence with the words, "mechanical ability."

Father, it's all so wonderful--this working plan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Universal Utilities."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes. It is a great plan. They have bodies very</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to ours, only there is a slight bulging to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead, and the hands are larger and the fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer than in the average individual. Their shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">are broader and their arms longer and more muscular.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our medical department says there is a shrinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body and lower limbs, but only slight. You see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they take practically no exercise, except what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have at their machines. We send them back to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">community homes in special passenger planes. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, they relax. They go to bed early and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically no amusements or sports. All they know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or want to know, is how to write a perfect letter. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ten thousand human machines like that, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenly divided between the sexes--for two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">years we have bred stenographers--we have raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on an intensive scale, specially fed and educated</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. I will tell you something that few realize, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause we have thoroughly bribed and controlled all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sources of information. These human machines ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture at the age of nine years, marry at ten and pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce baby stenographers at eleven years of age. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">other words, we have bred stenographers on a scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific scale as race horses or blooded cattle. Your great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">number-some-odd grandfather started the plan--we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaping the benefit. Before his time, they had a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of trouble with their office force--now we have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble whatever. They are simply wonderful pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of living machinery. Now you understand why you</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot be one of our stenographers. You are a won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derfully beautiful young woman. These living beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see in these glass cells are simply machines--</seg><seg type="columnLine">living, capable of some emotions, able to reproduce</seg><seg type="columnLine">other generations of machines, but absolutely incapable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doing any other kind of work. They are human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings so highly differentiated in their heredity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">development, that they are no longer to be considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the same level with the rest of humanity. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gained efficiency in one direction at the loss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">initiative in every other plane of human endeavor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The girl frowned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "And Universal Utilities did this to these people and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their ancestors without their consent?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Certainly.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan had long been dreamed of, but no one foVce had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been powerful enough to bring it about. Now, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Universal Utilities to finance it, the scheme was accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished, and there were no longer Baptists, Methodists</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Presbyterians, but over four hundred and twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects, united to form the University Protestant Church.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In every small town the little churches were torn down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be replaced by one beautiful chapel or cathedral.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hiram Smith attended personally to many of the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails.

For over two hundred years</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company, which I will some day own, has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberately breeding stenographers--as cattle or white</seg><seg type="columnLine">rats--breeding them to write perfect letters so Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versal Utilities can become great and crush out its</seg><seg type="columnLine">competitors. Now, after two hundred years, the poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">things are just like machines.

I will own that</seg><seg type="columnLine">company some day and with it will come the owner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship of ten thousand human machines and their pitiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">little children. Think of the babies--I understand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they are old enough to talk they are put to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work on miniature machines. They mature at nine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry at ten. They have no childhood, no playtime.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, even a hunting dog plays when it is a puppy.

I never wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you before because I did not want to hurt your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings. My father and mother were stenographers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">working for Universal Utilities, just as you say those</seg><seg type="columnLine">people are working today. I was their first and only</seg><seg type="columnLine">child.

But when the time came for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my earliest training, something went wrong. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed at the sight of the toy typewriter that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">put in front of me. I never did learn to use it--■</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not even touch it. To my parent's surprise, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">only grew half as fast, both mentally and physically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the other children of my age. At ten, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other children were working and thinking of marry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I had not yet entered my adolescence. Horrified,</seg><seg type="columnLine">degraded by the thought that they had produced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrosity, my parents had me placed in an aver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age New York City home, where they contributed liber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally to my support, though the family .that cared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me learned to love me and wanted to adopt me legally.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I grew older, my mother lived in the hope that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would change. She would come to see me once a year, &lt;,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying a portable Underwood with her. With tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her eyes she would beg me to try to write. I tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to humor her. I even promised her that I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take lessons, but it was impossible. Finally she lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope and told me that she realized that I was right</seg><seg type="columnLine">in planning to lead my life in my own way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Last year I made an investigation.

As far as oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ating the regular controls of the airplane and navi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gating in the ordinary way are concerned, I can handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole business; but when it comes to working a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudder that is going to steer us into the fourth dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, I'm afraid I'll want help from either or both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Banning looked straight at me and said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's up to you, then, my boy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me go along on the first trip?"

Ever since I was twelve years</seg><seg type="columnLine">old, I have been compelled to rely largely on my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts.

'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Professor Banning broke the silence: "I just thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a name for our baby.

It wasn't long before the reporters ferreted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out and insisted on getting an account of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He merely told them that we were working on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new type of improved airplane, by means of which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to surpass all previous records for speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Came at last the day of days. The last nut had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been screwed into place, the last coat of lacquer had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been blown on, every piece of mechanism had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">timed up with the most exacting care, the tanks had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been filled with Larsene and the Sprit of Youth was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for her maiden flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We started in the early hours of an April morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the first faint heralds of the coming dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to thrust their wan fingers into the murky sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the eastern hills. The exact time of our hop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">off we had successfully kept under cover, and only</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bryan and two of his most trusted assistants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there to see us off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No eagle has ever taken wing more gracefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">than did the Spirit of Youth, as with her oversized</seg><seg type="columnLine">propeller beating the air at a furious speed, she shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the runway like an arrow from a bow. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if she were off the ground almost the same instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her restraining bonds were released. Within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few seconds, San Diego and the Pacific had vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first hundred miles or so, we were content</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run the machine as an ordinary airplane, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing into play either the external lubricating sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem or the four dimensional rudder. We climbed rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly to an altitude of approximately twenty-five thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand feet, where our extra large propeller was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to develop a substantially accelerated speed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarefied atmosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We found it necessary to start our compressor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which drew air from outside and condensed it so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atmospheric pressure inside the cabin was auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matically maintained at what would correspond to</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal barometer pressure. A thermometer, specially</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed for recording the temperature outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, registered thirty-four degrees below zero, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we were kept quite comfortable--partly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceptional insulating properties of our walls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly through the aid of a small electric heater oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated from storage batteries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our super speedometer--which had been invented</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Professor Banning for the particular purpose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">measuring extremely high velocities--indicated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding speed of eight hundred and forty-one miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour. This, remember, was accomplished without</seg><seg type="columnLine">making use of the two revolutionary features on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we depended more than anything else for extra ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celeration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When our chronometer showed that we had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air for about twenty minutes, Professor Ban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning announced that we ought to be somewhere in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicinity of Phoenix, Arizona. To verify this, Berghlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the nose of the plane downward at a steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle and we dropped to an altitude of about fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet. We were just in time to catch a fleet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing glimpse of Roosevelt Dam and to see the buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Phoenix fading into the vague outlines behind us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up to this time, we had been flying almost due</seg><seg type="columnLine">east. We now veered to the northeast and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed to the twenty-five thousand foot level.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, for the first time, Professor Banning turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the external lubricating device. There was an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakable quickening. It was like coasting down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep grade with a car in low gear and then suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing out the clutch. A glance at our speedometer</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed that we were traveling at the amazing rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nine hundred and seventy-two miles per hour!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But while our initial trial of the external lubri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating system proved that it was a glorious success,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it also brought out a small fault which might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had serious consequences. No sooner had the fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">jets of oil bubbles been released outside the airplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">than every one of our windows became clouded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil, so that it was impossible to see through them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were reasonably safe in flying blindly so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we kept at this high altitude, but the possibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of something unexpected happening--made even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely by our tremendous speed--prompted Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banning to shut off the external lubrication. Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few moments the film obscuring the windows had</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely cleared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Banning then announced that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to try out the four dimensional rudder. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may well imagine what the coming out of our debutant</seg><seg type="columnLine">device meant to Professor Banning and me. We could</seg><seg type="columnLine">well appreciate the feelings of a composer who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent years of labor and has poured his very soul into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a symphony and then waits with thumping heart to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear how the critics receive his creation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following Professor Banning's orders, I took my</seg><seg type="columnLine">place at the delicately calibrated wheel which con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled the four dimensional rudder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take it easy!" he shouted in my ear. "Turn it</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a fraction of a degree and let's see what happens."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I followed directions. There was no result, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">my disappointment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give it a bit more," ordered Banning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Still no effect was noticeable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This time move it about five degrees."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did so. Then something did happen. The plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a sudden lurch and I felt that sinking, helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that I once experienced when a small car I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving skidded on a wet pavement and spun around</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a semi-circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a second or two, the Spirit of Youth slid side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise through the air, but Berghlin, with masterful</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill, got it under control and headed back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">course we had been following.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                   imk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of a wide strctch of earth, which from an airplane ordinarily looks cither flat or elso concave Uko the Inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a saucer, the earth beneath us was a well defined ball.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">538</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOUR DIMENSIONAL TRANSIT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">539</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE all kept our eyes fixed on the speedometer. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">registered eight hundred and thirty-nine miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour--exactly the same speed as we had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding when the four dimensional rudder was first</seg><seg type="columnLine">put into play. Then, to our surprise and dismay, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle indicating our speed began to slip backward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it finally steadied at eight hundred and fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you know about that!" I yelled. "Instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of speeding us up, the fool thing makes us go</seg><seg type="columnLine">slower. All that work for nothing, ding bust it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't be so sure that your efforts have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted," Banning tried to reassure me. "I'm not a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprised myself. In fact, it's just what I expected."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just what you expected? Then why in the world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you get the point? Can't you understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it makes a lot of difference whether we are mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from west to east or from east to west? Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">now we are traveling in the same direction as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. As long as we are tied to the earth by</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitation, our movements with respect to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">point on its surface are the same as if the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">were standing still. But as soon as we cut off some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gravitational force, our plane becomes a sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arate body, competing in speed with the earth itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ground just beneath us is moving forward at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of approximately one thousand miles per hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and since our speed is only about eight hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty miles per hour, it is but natural that we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">lag behind a bit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then what good is the four dimensional rudder?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Haven't you figured it out yet? When we move</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the opposite direction, conditions are reversed. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will be traveling from east to west and the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be spinning in the opposite direction--which will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the effect of increasing our velocity by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount, besides the extra speed we will gain by sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the power otherwise needed to keep us in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air against gravitation. I'm getting tireC' of yelling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll write the rest of my explanation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He picked up a pad and pencil and rapidly wrote the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Imagine yourself on an enormous steamship. As-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sume that this hypothetical craft is one hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and is capable of developing a speed of one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred miles per hour. You are in an airplane which</seg><seg type="columnLine">can travel at the rate of one hundred miles per hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">while taxying and at exactly the same rate while in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. If your plane taxies along the deck of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, it will take just one hour to travel from stem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern. The time required to make this trip will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">precisely the same, whether the ship is stationary or</seg><seg type="columnLine">is moving ahead at top speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But suppose you hop off into the air while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship is steaming ahead at the rate of one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per hour. A moment after the take-off, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">initial speed of your plane would be two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per hour, one hundred of which would be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped by the airplane motor and one hundred by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the momentum borrowed from the forward motion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The speed created by the motor would continue at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rate of one hundred miles per hour, but the extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentum due to the speed of the ship would grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually decrease. In this case, it would take consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably longer to fly from stern to stem than to taxi the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same distance. And if the extra momentum happens</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become exhausted before the airplane has finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trip, the airplane would never be able to reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prow but would remain directly above the same point</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ship's deck, since it would be flying at exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same speed as the ship is traveling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tore a sheet off the pad and handed it to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While I was reading it, he wrote the following:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This accounts for our decrease in speed after we</seg><seg type="columnLine">detached ourselves 'partially from the gravitational at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traction of the earth. While our motor was pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">us ahead at the rate of eight hundred and forty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour, we were also being carried along with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere of the earth at an additional velocity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately one thousand miles per hour. As long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we remained completely within the gravitational in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence of the earth, we continued to acquire this extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. But the instant the four dimensional rudder</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed us in a position where we were influenced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a portion of the earth's gravitational field, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to lose some of the momentum given us by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's rotation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When we start traveling from east to west, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a different story. To return to the analogy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane on the giant ship, it will be like flying from</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem to stern instead of from stern to stem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If the plane taxies from stem to stern, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it exactly the same amount of time as to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trip in the opposite direction, regardless of how</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast or how slow the ship may be moving. But when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the airplane rises into the air and flies from stem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern at 100 miles per hour, while the ship is travel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ahead at the same speed, the velocity of the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">with respect to any point on the ship will be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sum of its own speed plus the speed of the ship--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or 200 miles per hour. In that case it would cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 100 miles between the stem and the stern in half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time, or 30 minutes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded to show that I understood this explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ccoHALL I point the four dimensional rudder in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other direction before we lose any more</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentum?" I shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Banning signified assent. I carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned the control until the indicator pointed to zero.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing happened except that our velocity continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to diminish. Banning waited for me-to do the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to him was apparently quite obvious--then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">yelled:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought you said you were going to steer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite direction. You'll never get back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rudder in a neutral position."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That sure made me feel dumb. Rather sheepishly, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjusted the rudder so that it was turned about five</seg><seg type="columnLine">degrees in the opposite direction. For a few seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing happened. Then there was another sickening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">skidding jolt and our machine began to spin in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane parallel to the surface of the earth. The peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement reminded me of a plate which a vaudeville</seg><seg type="columnLine">juggler sends spinning through the air in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way that it comes back to his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once again the masterful skill of our pilot saved us</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the airplane got completely out of control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately we began to pick up speed until we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had settled down to a gait of approximately eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and fifty miles per hour, while flying at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitude of over twenty thousand feet. This velocity</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reduced by nearly one hundred miles per hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, following Professor Banning's instructions, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to the four thousand foot level.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within a few minutes we had shot completely over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beyond a large city as quickly as an express train</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashes through a tank settlement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was Denver," Berghlin shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Might as well turn here and head back to San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diego," Professor Banning ordered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">540</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Berghlin brought the plane around in a wide circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a few seconds later we were over Denver again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banning then yelled these instructions:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to try a little experiment. Let's just circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the city for a while. Fly low enough so we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the details of the buildings. That's fine!" Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he commanded me, "Now for the four dimensional rud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. Give her just enough to steer her to the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hyper-space."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the plane still circling about the city, I care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully manipulated the control. This time Berghlin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for the skidding spin and in a jiffy had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airship under perfect control. Then a most prepos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terous series of phenomena burst on our consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During our previous trial of the four dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudder, we had been flying over uninhabited territory</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at an altitude so great that the earth was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight. For that reason we had noticed nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially unusual about the appearance of visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects. But in flying over the metropolitan city, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had plenty of things to look at and an excellent op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity to study four dimensional perspective.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The insides of all buildings were visible to us. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like doll houses that are open at the tops or</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronts, so that all the furniture and other objects in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the rooms are plainly visible. The most peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was that the roofs and the nearest walls did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">look transparent or totally absent as they should logi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally have been in order to expose the interiors to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our gaze. On the contrary, they seemed to be as solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">and substantial as the rest of the buildings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another amazing thing was that we seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to view the objects beneath us from all direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions at once. For instance, I caught a fleeting glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a red-faced corpulent human biped dressed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his B.V.D.'s and manipulating his body into ridiculous</seg><seg type="columnLine">postures. I swear that at one and the same time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the top of his head, the soles of his feet, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and left sides, his chest and his back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without intending to peep, we found ourselves wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessing some intimate and funny scenes as we whizzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by hotels and apartment houses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I'm afraid we are committing a reprehensible</seg><seg type="columnLine">solecism by spying on the privacy of our fellow hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mans in this way," Professor Banning yelled," so let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">be on our way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as we were headed westward, it became in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly apparent that the four dimensional rudder had</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than fulfilled our expectations. Although we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were just on the border line of hyper-space and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only partially outside the gravitational field of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, the effect of having the globe spinning in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite direction beneath us became apparent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were also anxious to try out the external lubri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating system, so I rigged up a crude device by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of which we could from time to time wipe off</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clear place on the oil covered windows. Then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on the oil globules and at last were shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">through space at what we thought was the maximum</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit of our speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the time we left Denver until we landed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Diego, we were in the air for approximately forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes--which indicated the astounding speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about 1,500 miles per hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our trial spin had proved the Spirit of Youth to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wonderful success. The only flaw we had been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discover in the entire mechanism was the clouding</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our windows by the oil-mist, and this was trivial.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All we had to do was to install automatic windshield</seg><seg type="columnLine">wipers on each pane of glass and our mechanism was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for its trip around the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Pontius Bragg Butts In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAVING demonstrated that the Boerner motor,the</seg><seg type="columnLine">external lubrication system and the four dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional rudder were all practical and having sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfied himself that the Spirit of Youth would do all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had expected, Professor Banning consented to furnish</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newspapers and magazines with a description of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his invention and his plans for circumnavigating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe in less than eighteen hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You probably recall the interest and excitement that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stimulated when this astonishing announcement</seg><seg type="columnLine">was first made public. Perhaps it was only natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">that most of the newspaper writers treated the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a joke. Some were even bold enough to hint that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Banning's brain had become slightly addled</seg><seg type="columnLine">through too much ratiocination over tesseracts, hecato-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nicosiahedragons and other four dimensional nonsense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was gratifying to note, however, that the news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers of the better class gave the matter serious con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideration and attention.

Of course they gave no par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular weight to my corroboration and many were</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined to discount Professor Banning's assertions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to ninety-nine and forty one hundreths per cent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the inhabitants of these United States the word of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berghlin was as good as the word of George Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The controversy was at its zenith when Pontius</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bragg butted into the argument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everybody has heard of Pontius Bragg--the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal bluff, four-flusher and egoist that ever-^ried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get his name in the papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bragg, you will remember, first came into promi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nence several years ago when, after having led an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploring party into central Asia, he returned with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">announcement that he and a single companion named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Story had succeeded in scaling the highest peak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mount Everest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The world in general accepted his claim without ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and, for about a week, Bragg was on the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">page of nearly every newspaper throughout the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wherever he went he was the center of hero-worship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping and adulatory mobs.

The utter inability of Bragg</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Story to furnish a plausible and consistent ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation of how they were able to survive the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific blizzards that are incessantly raging on the slopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mount Everest, and how they were able to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve enough physical energy to struggle through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely rarefied atmosphere at the tremendous alti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude of 29,002 feet, was the first thing to excite their</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The committee, organized to glorify Bragg's supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">achievement, ended by making a gruelling investiga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. They unearthed some startling information.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Story, the sole corroborator of Bragg's claim, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to be a notorious swindler, liar and ex-convict.

He had then announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">his intention to fly in an airplane across the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pole and Aukland to Capetown. He even went so, far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to make the journey to Aukland, taking with 'him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a specially built airplane and a crew consisting of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanics and two pilots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After several delays and false starts, he finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopped off, only to return in a few hours with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">report that he had run into a terrific storm. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">performance was repeated no less than four times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the public got so sick of Bragg, that practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the newspapers ignored him and consigned to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste basket the reams of publicity, which were pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared and planted by Bragg's paid press agents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then Bragg returned to the United States and suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded in getting a few newspapers to print the an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncement that he had postponed his flight across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Pole until the following fall when he expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather conditions would be more favorable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bragg's most recent opportunity to break into print</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came after Professor Banning released his startling an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nouncement regarding the Spirit of Youth and our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plans to circumnavigate the globe in less than eighteen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN open letter, signed by Bragg, was published</seg><seg type="columnLine">simultaneously in several of the more sensational</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspapers throughout the United States. It started</seg><seg type="columnLine">out by affirming that Professor Banning's theories</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ridiculous and absolutely impracticable. In sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port of his statement, Bragg offered to wager $10,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">against an equal amount to be posted by Banning that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spirit of Youth woulld not succeed in its initial</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip in circumnavigating the globe in less than eighteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Following the publication of this challenge, a flock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of reporters called on us. Professor Banning made a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dignified reply to Bragg's letter. He stated that he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">did not approve of betting or any other form of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gambling for gain. But in order to justify his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">faith in the Spirit of Youth and to prevent Bragg</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from getting away with what looked like an egregious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bluff, Professor Banning made the following counter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proposal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Instead of $10,000, Banning offered to post $20,000</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">providing Bragg would put up a like sum. In case</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Spirit of Youth succeeded in circumnavigating the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">globe in less than eighteen hours, making one or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more stops on the way around, all of the $40,000</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was to be used to endow a fellowship, the income</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from which would make it possible for some young</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man of unusual promise to devote his life to the ad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vancement of aviation. If the Spirit of Youth did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not get completely around the earth on its first at-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tempt or if the feat of circumnavigation was accom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plished in more than eighteen hours, the $40,000</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was to be devoted to any charitable or educational</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">purpose which Bragg chose to name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bragg's rejoinder was a typical reflection of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man's character. He consented to raising the ante</seg><seg type="columnLine">from $10,000 to $20,000, but when it came to the clause</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding "any charitable or educational purpose," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I believe that both education and charity begin at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">home. The only charity I am interested in is the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">future welfare of Pontius Bragg and his immediate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">family. The only education I care anything about is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the education of the Bragg offspring." By this he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could have referred only to Pontius Bragg, Jr., his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only child, who had already been expelled from two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Eastern colleges and had acquired considerable no-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toriety through his mad pranks in the night clubs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  You can well imagine that this statement did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitigate Bragg's unpopularity with the public and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the press.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Much as he detested Bragg's principles and Bragg's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude, Professor Banning accepted his final stipula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He insisted, however, that the $20,000 be put</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in cash by each party and placed on escrow at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank in order to guarantee the fulfillment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This was done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Across the Pacific</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE the controversy was going on between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Messrs. Banning and Bragg, we had been busily</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged in grooming the Spirit of Youth for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her crucial flight. Mechanically there were only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">additions and changes needed. The most essential</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these was the installation of the automatic win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow wipers already mentioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although the machine was capable of carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough Larsene to propel it 25,000 miles, or com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely around the earth, and although we had every</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to believe that we could easily circumnavigate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the globe and return to our home port without stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping, Professor Banning very wisely decided not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make it a non-stop flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This is not to be a mere stunt;' it is to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical demonstration," he stated. "There is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical value in flying completely around the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ending up at the starting point without making</seg><seg type="columnLine">any stops on the way. That's why we intend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make at least one stop--possibly two or more. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first will be at Shanghai. If we decide to alight a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second time, it will probably be at Paris."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Over a month previous to our departure Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banning had arranged to have &lt;\ supply of Larsene</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipped to each of the two cities just mentioned. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though this was not exactly necessary, it was done as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a measure of precaution, in order to make sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would have a large reserve of fuel to draw on if</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As is usually the case on long flights, our store of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fuel constituted the major portion of our cargo. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few sandwiches and three large thermos bottles full</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of hot malted milk was all the food we expected to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">consume during the journey. We also had a five</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gallon keg of fresh water and enough concentrated,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">liquid food to last us a month in case we should be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forced to land in some remote place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In addition to the regulation equipment, the Spirit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of Youth was provided with a specially constructed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">telescope which had a camera attachment. The tele-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scope was operated somewhat on the principle of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">submarine's periscope, except that when in use, it pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">truded from the bottom of the airplane instead of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">top. With this device, it was possible to turn the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">542</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jective of the telescope in any direction. It could</seg><seg type="columnLine">even be extended at right angles, far enough to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side to clear the body of the plane and in this posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion afforded an unobscured view directly overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was but one opening to the cabin and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door had double walls like the rest of the body. Wht*'"</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, it was absolutely air-tight. Since we expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do most of our flying at an altitude of over 30,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in order to take advantage of the low resistance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the more rarefied air, our equipment also included</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small compressor, which I have referred to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously. This operated automatically, drawing air from</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside and compressing it until it was just the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">density for comfortable breathing. For use in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of emergencies, an adequate supply of oxygen was</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided. We also were supplied with a ch«mical</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus for absorbing carbon dioxide from th'e air</seg><seg type="columnLine">after we had breathed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After all these devices and supplies had been care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully inspected and checked over, the Spirit of Youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wheeled out on the runway and we were ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to start. It was in the middle of June--the fifteenth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be exact--close enough to the summer solstice to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assure us of having the maximum amount of daylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our trip. For certain reasons, Professor Banning</seg><seg type="columnLine">had set the hour of 12 noon as the starting time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At about nine in the morning we started getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spirit of Youth ready for the great adventure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tanks were filled with fuel and a plentiful supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oil--both for internal and external lubrication--was</seg><seg type="columnLine">put into the storage compartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything was carefully inspected by all three of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and each of us was also held individually responsible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a complete and painstaking checking of all details,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which came within our own particular jurisdiction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For instance, Berghlin went over every cap, lever and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolt of the motor and the control mechanism; Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Banning saw to it that the equipment of instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, accessories and supplies was complete, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspected, with meticulous care, the four dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">rudder and everything connected with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This work was all completed by ten forty-five and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had an hour and a quarter of idleness before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time set for our take-off. That brief period of wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing seemed like months. It was the hardest, most</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerve racking part of the entire adventure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the zero hour arrived!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though we had done all we could to keep the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">date of our departure a secret, the news had leaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and there was a goodly coterie of newspaper men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">photographers and motion picture camera men--as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as several hundred other spectators present to see us</seg><seg type="columnLine">off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PROFESSOR BANNING and Berghlin stepped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin as nonchalantly as if they were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a short jaunt to Los Angeles. As for me, I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no bones over the fact that I was both scared and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous. I felt a great deal as I did the first time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever dove from a spring board twenty-five feet above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. I hated to take the jump, and at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I didn't want the people who were watching me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see me hesitate too long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so, with a sinking heart and with shimmying</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, I scrambled through the narrow opening and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berghlin clamped the air proof door shut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later we heard the barrage of the motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we were darting down the runway. With his</seg><seg type="columnLine">consummate skill, our pilot maneuvered the heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">laden machine off the ground and headed her nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward. For several minutes we climbed upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">until we had reached an altitude of several thousand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Professor Banning then turned on both the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ternal lubricating system and the mechanism for</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping the air inside the cabin at a comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing pressure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Professor Banning signalled for me to deflect</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four dimensional rudder. I gradually turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel until we felt the peculiar skidding motion which</seg><seg type="columnLine">told us that we were being steered into hyper-space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berghlin soon had the airplane under perfect control</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we all settled down for a monotonous, steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">grind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At about one forty-five. Banning scribbled a note</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held it up where both the pilot and I could read:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We ought to be pretty close to the Hawaiian Islands</seg><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure enough, a few moments later, after we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended to an altitude of about 3,000 feet, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to make out the distinctive outlines of the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Hawaii, with two small specks which we knew to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be Hilo and Maui lying to the west of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes we had left the "Paradise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pacific" far in the rear and were flying high above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vast expanse of ocean.

But, despite our protests and</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate struggles, the crowd dragged us out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin and carried us about the field, while the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made hideous by the raucous honking of auto</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns and the shrieking of human voices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time we had persuaded our well meaning, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">r.one the less troublesome admirers to permit us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to the Spirit of Youth and to get it refueled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into the air again, we had lost over an hour out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our precious eighteen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Far Into Hyper-Space</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN we finally found ourselves once more off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground we all three heaved sighs of relief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was then that Professor Banning did an</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing thing. He scribbled a note and handed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Berghlin. Looking over his shoulder, I read, "Head</seg><seg type="columnLine">due east."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could hardly believe my eyes and Berghlin seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally puzzled.

Antici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pating our objections, he hastily wrote the following:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Please do as I ask. I'll explain later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was enough for Berghlin. While he was bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the plane about, Professor Banning was busily</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged in scribbling another note. This he handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. It said, "Turn the F.D.R. until I signal you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop."</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOUR DIMENSIONAL TRANSIT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">543</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With infinite care I slowly turned the wheel. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">about five degrees there was the usual skidding sensa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I stopped, but Professor Banning motioned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to continue turning it in the same direction. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed. When the dial pointed to twenty-seven degrees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane gave a terrific lurch, and the Profeasor sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nalled: "Stop!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With another note, Banning then directed the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a wide semi-circle which would gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring the airplane around until it pointed west again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This maneuver completed, the Professor scribbled off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his promised explanation. It read like this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To make up for the time we've lost, we must do</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to increase our speed. I figured out a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do this. When we were traveling from west to</seg><seg type="columnLine">east at the rate of 800 miles per hour we also Were</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding along with the earth's atmosphere which' is</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving from west to east at the rate of approximately</seg><seg type="columnLine">1,000 miles per hour. (For convenience I am using</seg><seg type="columnLine">only round numbers.) This made our total, absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed about 1,800 miles per hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By steering with the F.D.R. for a considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance into hyper-space, we have been able to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tach ourselves almost entirely from the gravitational</seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction of the earth--while still maintaining our</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of 1,800 miles per hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now that we are headed east again, the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth is moving beneath us in the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction with a speed of 1,000 miles per hour, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">we ought still to be making nearly 1,800 miles per</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. Suppose we assume that in making the turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and getting headed west again we lost some of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity--say 300 miles per hour. We would still have</seg><seg type="columnLine">left a rate of 1,500 miles per hour, which added to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed of the earth's rotation would make our</seg><seg type="columnLine">velocity with respect to any point on the earth's sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, approximately 2,500 miles per hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head to indicate that I did not compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hend fully. Professor Banning amplified his explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's go back to the analogy of the airplane on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck of the imaginary steamship 100 miles long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and traveling at a speed of 100 miles per hour. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane taxies toward the bow at the rate of 100</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per hour and then flies off, its initial velocity will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be 200 miles per hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, suppose it makes a hairpin turn so that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">moves in the opposite direction from that in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship is sailing. If it is able to maintain its origi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal rate of 200 miles per hour, its velocity with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spect to any point on the boat will be 300 miles per</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, enabling it to travel the 100 miles from stem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stern in one-third of an hour or twenty minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In actuality, of course, it would quickly lose its</seg><seg type="columnLine">original speed, due to the resistance of the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up here, however, the atmosphere is very rarefied</seg><seg type="columnLine">and also because of our special devices for reducing</seg><seg type="columnLine">both friction and gravitational attraction, our loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be very slight.

This may either be a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot like a bullet from a gun or a steady stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparks or burning gases like the tail of a rocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like the kick of a gun, this produces a reaction which</seg><seg type="columnLine">will push the plane in the opposite direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since there are ten tubes--all capable of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOUR DIMENSIONAL TRANSIT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">547</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed in different directions--we can easily steer</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward any given point, merely by turning one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the tubes in the direction opposite from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which we desire to go, and shooting a charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive gas through the tubes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how shall we know whether to steer north,</seg><seg type="columnLine">south, east or west?" Berghlin asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear boy, there are no such words as north or</seg><seg type="columnLine">east--or even up or down in the universe. Even on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, these terms are very ambiguous. For example,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Amundsen flew across the north pole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norge, he traveled due north until he passed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pole; then he immediately began to travel southward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or in exactly the opposite direction, although he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">change his course a particle and continued to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same direction he was going when hf was</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed north.	&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Likewise, when an aviator flies around the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from east to west, his direction, while he is flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">over China is exactly opposite to what it is when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is over Pennsylvania, and yet in both cases he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling toward the west.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The terms up and down are also inexact. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">they really mean is 'away from the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth' and 'toward the center of the earth.' At twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock, noon, the steeple of a church points in exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposite direction from what it does at 12 o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight. At six o'clock it points at right angles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the original direction, yet we say the steeple always</seg><seg type="columnLine">points 'up.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you get away from the earth, such terms as</seg><seg type="columnLine">up or down, north or south, east or west, have abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely no significance. That is, unless we adopt some</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of definition and arbitrarily assign meanings</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them. For instance, we can draw an imaginary</seg><seg type="columnLine">line from the North Star to the center of the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and continue it for an indefinite distance beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun. This we can call our North and South Line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the center of the sun, we can then pass a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane of unlimited area meeting the North and South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Line at right angles. Some prominent star which</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens to fall within this plane may now be selected</seg><seg type="columnLine">and named the 'East Star.' A line drawn from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">star through and beyond the center of the sun will</seg><seg type="columnLine">give us our East and West Line. If we wish to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clude hyper-space in our chart, it will be necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw a fourth line through the center of the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">at right angles to each of the other three lines. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">line will extend into the fourth dimension. To it we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can give any name we wish--as for instance the 'In</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Out Line.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With these four co-ordinates we can easily locate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with definite exactness, any object in the Solar Sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem, or for that matter in the entire universe. A com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete science of navigation for space flyers could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">built up, using this conception as a basis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And do we have to figure all this out in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find our way to the moon and back?" asked Berghlin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh no, indeed.

'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That reminds me," the Professor remarked. "We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a long time without food.

Since Banning had</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured us that we had an ample supply of concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated food, we all ate heartily, making no attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to conserve our rations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When it seemed to me but a few minutes after we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished eating, Banning said, "Well, -boys, it's past</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight now. Aren't you going to bed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not a bit sleepy," I assured him. "You two go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead and sleep.

"I'm too nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, if you boya don't mind, I believe I will take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nap. If anything unusual happens, be sure and wake</seg><seg type="columnLine">me." With this, the Professor stretched himself out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor of the cabin, drew up a blanket, and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly began to snore contentedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Professor Banning asleep, Berghlin and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at loss for something to occupy our minds. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had not expected to have any time to kill on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid trip around the earth, we had brought with us</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither books, cards nor other means of passing away</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time. While Banning was awake, we were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent to ask him questions and listen to his interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanations, but since neither of us two knew any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about interplanetary navigation, we soon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give up trying to figure out what the result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our amazing voyage would be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There wa3 nothing to do but stare out of the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow and we soon found the vista quite monotonous--;</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishing and spectacular as it was at first sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Were it not for the brilliant sunlight streaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the windows that faced old Sol, we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought we were flying through stygian dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. The sky was as black as a windowless cellar</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of coal.

We could make out the form of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire globe and could even distinguish the familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlines of the eastern hemisphere. About half of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the globe was brightly illuminated and the other half</seg><seg type="columnLine">but faintly visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Much the same "half lit up" appearance charac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terized the moon, which had grown until it looked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">large as a medicine ball. Little change had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in the apparent proportions of the sun--but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a far different sun--a sun the like of which human</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes had never before beheld. The corona was con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly visible. It shot out gigantic tongues of daz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zling flame in all directions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MY contemplation of the heavens was interrupted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cheery, "Good morning, boys," from the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor who had just awakened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good morning?" I questioned. "Aren't you a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">too soon? It can't be much after midnight.

To be on the safe side, I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll give the rocket tubes another shot or two."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made the adjustments and a moment later we</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the fizzing sound which told us that the burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases were being projected through one of the tubes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The machine veered to one side until we were fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a direction parallel to the surface of the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of pointing directly toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to steer in such a way that we'll pass</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">around the moon in the opposite direction from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion around the earth," the Professor explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That will make our speed with respect to the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the moon greater than if we traveled in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction the moon is moving."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't long before we were close enough to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon's surface to observe all details of its configura-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion quite plainly and to distinguish objects even as</seg><seg type="columnLine">small as a few feet in height.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If I were writing a piece of extravagant fiction, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the creative imagination of a Jules Verne or an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Edgar Allan Poe to help me, I could undoubtedly make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fascinating and amazing chapter out of what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were supposed to see on the moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could clothe it with grotesque vegetation and peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple it with preposterously queer beings. I could de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribe the peculiar buildings and fantastic monuments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a departed race of former inhabitants. Gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects and abortive monsters could be made to prowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid lakes of blood and mountains of glittering jewels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had there been any such freaks on the moon, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily have distinguished them clearly--even without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aid of our telescope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what's the use of idle speculation? My job is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of a historian rather than a fabricator of color-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful yarns--so I'll have to stick to the truth. Much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I regret to report them, the facts concerning what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw on the moon were exceedingly drab and uninter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True, we did get excellent vistas of the portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon on the side away from the earth--which</seg><seg type="columnLine">never before had been seen by human eyes--^but these</seg><seg type="columnLine">views were quite commonplace. Any astronomer--mere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly from logical deduction--could easily infer with rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonable accuracy what the other side of the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks like.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Except for the natural differences in the size and</seg><seg type="columnLine">locations of the craters and "ring mountains," the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the far side of the moon had practically the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same characteristics as the portion that is constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing the earth--which has been repeatedly photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphed and charted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our observations verified conclusively the belief of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists who have become convinced that the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">is absolutely devoid of both moisture and atmosphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is no life of any sort--vegetable or animal--on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon. To live on the moon, a man would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring air, water and food with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This ought to settle definitely the question some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times brought up by some pseudo-scientific people as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whether or not the moon is inhabited or capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sustaining life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took but a short time for us to complete the semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular journey around the moon, after which the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor fired a couple of shots from the rocket tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thus changed our direction until we were headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight toward the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only a few minutes had elapsed--though the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already becoming perceptibly smaller--when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berghlin suddenly exclaimed: "How about the photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphs?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!

It will be nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared to the pleasure I'll get from knowing how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he will feel when he learns that we are back safe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound with a number of irrefutable photographs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove that we've actually made the trip around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we sped closer and closer toward the earth, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were like a trio of school boys who had just completed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last stiff examination and were journeying toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">home and vacation time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just think what a sensation we'll make when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get back," I said on one occasion.

It seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase in size much more rapidly than it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminished on the outward journey, indicating that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed was considerably greater. This could easily be</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounted for by the extra impetus imparted by fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent discharges through the rocket tubes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the earth loomed up until it obscured nearly all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sky ahead, we could catch an occasional glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a patch of water or land through rifts in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks of cloud that enveloped the globe, but we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not get a clear enough view to identify any portion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth with certainty. Once I felt sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I recognized the outlines of Spain and the Straits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gibraltar, and Professor Banning altered our course</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly toward the direction of North America. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time he turned on the external lubricating</seg><seg type="columnLine">system and fired several shots through the tubes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forward end of the machine. He explained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons for doing tbis as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't be long now before we shall enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more rarefied portions of the earth's atmosphere. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">how fast we are going now is pretty hard to estimate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it is quite possible that if we continued at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">present velocity--even with our external lubrication in</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation--the friction caused by our passage through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth's atmosphere would generate a terrific amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heat--just as it does in the case of a meteor, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To be on the safe side, I think we'd better slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">down considerably. The discharges through the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes pointing straight ahead should have a powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">braking effect, reducing our speed to safe degrees."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a good thing he thought of this when he did,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he had hardly spoken before it began to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come uncomfortably warm inside the cabin, indicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the heat of friction was even intense enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate the special insulation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the sweat streaming from his forehead, Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Banning directed a continuous stream of burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing gases through the forward tubes. Finally the</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature began to fall again, showing that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crisis had passed and that disaster had been averted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the resourcefulness and quick thinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our learned commander.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time, Berghlin had taken his place at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turn on the motor and let's see what happens,1'■</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banning directed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An instant later we heard the welcome hum of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine.

They must have sighted us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized the Spirit of Youth, because two of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew toward us, while the other descended, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry the news of our arrival to the officials on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The escorts sent to greet us circled and attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accompany us, but we were miles beyond them be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they had time to turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When we came within sight of the airport, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were astonished to discern thousands of jostling, mill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing human beings tightly packed around the edges</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the field. A space had been roped off and a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of men in uniform were trying to keep the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">in check. Just as we were on the point of landing, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob broke through the ropes and quickly swarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over most of the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his usual skill and resourcefulness, Berghlin</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked his downward plunge just in time and zoomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to a safer altitude. After circling the field several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, vainly hoping that the crowd would have sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to clear a space large enough for him to land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he finally spied a small patch of open ground in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner, shut off from the rest of the field by a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of parked automobiles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SS2</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barely grazing the tops of the cars, he made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful landing, bringing the Spirit of Youth to rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the propeller but a few inches from a barbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire fence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an instant the crowd was around us, and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears were almost deafened by the most raucous con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glomeration of cheers, yells, laughter--and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Berghlin was the first to step out of the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With characteristic sang froid he said, "Sorry, we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">late, folks.

Finally the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police came to our rescue and escorted us into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office of the airport, where Berghlin went through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the customary routine of signing in. As he was filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his report, he asked one of the officials, "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">time is it? My watch is stopped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly five forty-seven."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what's the date?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "June sixteenth, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "June sixteenth?"

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">did want to be alone, however, for there was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When at last everybody had left, and the three of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us were closeted in Banning's room, I broke out:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, Professor, so far you've been able to account</seg><seg type="columnLine">for everything that has happened in a satisfactory</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, but now you sure have a lot of tall explaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just let me have a pencil, a scrap of paper and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about five minutes, and I think I can explain every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in such a way that it will be as clear as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road to the moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the first place, let me remind you that when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot off into hyper-space after leaving Shanghai, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had for the moment turned the nose of our plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the east. That gave us the benefit of the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion due to the rotation of the earth. I've already</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained this to you, but what I didn't mention before</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, that during the few seconds prior to our extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">projection into the fourth dimension, we were also</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling in a direction which gave us the added</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentum due to the revolution of the earth about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will also recall that after detaching ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">from three dimensional space, we made a hair-pin</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn, which brought us around so we were moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the opposite direction. Do you happen to know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast the earth moves around the sun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not off-hand," I admitted, "but I think I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure it out--approximately at least. I know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance between the earth and the sun is about</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety-three million miles, and that the orbit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, though elliptical, is near enough to a circle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that if we multiply the radius by two pi or six</seg><seg type="columnLine">point twenty-eight, we'll get the approximate circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference of the earth's orbit. Without multiplying it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, I'd guess that this will give us something under</seg><seg type="columnLine">six hundred million miles.

"And to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save you the time it would take to do all that cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culating, I'll tell you right now that the earth and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon together travel around the sun at the rate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen and one-half miles per second or sixty-three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles per hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another thing that helped us was that the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that particular time was on the side of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the direction of rotation.

Even now I doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we shall have sufficient time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you serious, Jopplin?" replied the captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching the other's face doubtfully. "Do you fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize the importance of what you are saying?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My answer," said the professor slowly, "is before</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Although this is hardly a time for lengthy ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planations upon abstract principles of science, I can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not but sympathize with your attitude. Consequently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend, I shall endeavor, as briefly as possible, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfold to you the conclusion which my hurried and</seg><seg type="columnLine">imperfect investigation has revealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Laplace," continued Jopplin warming to his sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject, "left the world a much greater contribution than</seg><seg type="columnLine">either he or his contemporaries realized. As a system</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cosmogony, the Nebular Hypothesis is untenable;</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a model of celestial travel, it is superb. That this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact should have been overlooked by the scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">world for over a century is almost unbelievable. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle of conservation of angular momentum, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sound in 1796, is equally so today. Moreover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when centripetal and centrifugal force are exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">balanced, gravity, as you know, ceases. If, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotating upon its axis once in twenty-four hours, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth should complete its rotation in one hour and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five minutes, what would happen to objects</seg><seg type="columnLine">situated at the equator? Such objects would, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no doubt already surmised, remain utterly devoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of weight, until such time as the rotation became</seg><seg type="columnLine">slower and centrifugal force diminished. But let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">assume that the contrary should take place, and, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of decreasing, centrifugal force should increase.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then what would be the result? There, my good</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, you have a clear theoretical possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-terrestrial locomotion. Assuming the proper con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions, it is theoretically possible for any object, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter how great its weight, to leave the earth's sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face without the slightest danger or difficulty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, to an investigator possessing the scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability of Teranhoff, such an obvious principle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanics could not have long remained unnoticed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, as he himself must have realized, terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemistry offered nothing that could even approximate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the results he desired. Terrestrial analogy afforded</seg><seg type="columnLine">no solution; so Teranhoff quite logically, took his</seg><seg type="columnLine">model from the stars. Regarding the nature of sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic energy--whose development would be a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">glorious achievement in the proper hands--I have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">first-hand knowledge; yet by means of theoretical con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderations, I have already formed some idea of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent of its power. And, assuming that the proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods were employed, I have no doubt that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, stupendous as its weight appears to our minds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be either retarded or accelerated at will.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE WORLD WENT MAD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">557</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So much for theoretical considerations.

All this, however, required time, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meanwhile gravity was alarmingly decreasing.

Already at the age of forty-five, recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one of the world's foremost authorities upon astro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">physics, the scientist had sailed from New York to</seg><seg type="columnLine">collaborate in a series of investigations about to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">commenced in the Southern Hemisphere by the Chilean</seg><seg type="columnLine">government.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, however, his thoughts were far away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original purpose of his trip. Henry Jopplin would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have given his consent to an experiment carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at the risk of a single human life; but as a true</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of science it was impossible for him not to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience a keen sense of professional curiosity in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupendous achievement of the Russian scientist. Ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">558</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">anhoff, the professor reflected, was undoubtedly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heartless fanatic, perhaps even a madman; but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing wrong with his science. Despite his fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aticism, the man was clearly no mere empirical dabbler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a genius combining mathematical theory with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligent experimentation. And that his latest experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment would prove only too successful, Jopplin now had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Lithuania, her mighty engines running at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">full capacity, was already in sight of the Panama coast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nor had the professor's desire for speed been without</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause. The sea, which during the earlier part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day had been usually calm, had now completely altered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from the east came a wind which threatened soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become cyclonic in its fury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later, the Lithuania riding safely at anchof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Jopplin was seated before the chief military</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer at Colon. Owing to his reputation, the scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">had encountered no difficulty in obtaining the informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion he desired. The officer was now informing him of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the measures which had already been taken in Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington, of the observational data which were rapidly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing accumulated, and finally of the air squadron that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had departed but a short time before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jopplin listened to the steady voice of the officer me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanically, a far-off look in his eyes. Suddenly, his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression changed, the thin countenance revealing a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Commandant," said the scientist hurriedly, "can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare one more plane?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •■But -" stammered the other visibly astonished,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"you cannot possibly mean to say-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," snapped Jopplin in a tone which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely reminiscent of the laboratory; "that is pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisely my intention. Of course," he added quickly, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will understand that I am not an aviator. An oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor will be necessary. May I have your answer at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Professor Jopplin," replied the officer, clearly grop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for words, "in your capacity as a man of science</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have no doubt of your ability; but the present situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion appears to me to call for prompt and drastic mili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary action, rather than for scientific speculation.

That power, Sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is Science!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PROFESSOR JOPPLIN won his case. A half hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, seated in the after cockpit of a bombing</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane specially constructed for high altitude flying, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the narrow strip of land dividing the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">great oceans gradually recede from sight. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-dealing instrument of modern warfare grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the scientist's hand. His thin, hawk-like fingers held</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small and well worn notebook, the leaves of which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">vainly endeavored to prevent from being whipped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fro by the ever-increasing wind. Yet oblivious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, Henry Jopplin figured on. Stimulated by the desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate nature of his mission and strangely exhilarated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the swift motion of the plane, he seemed to experi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ence all the joy of the mathematician whose goal is</seg><seg type="columnLine">already in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length the long southwestern coast of Columbia</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into view; the aviator was now directing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane inland, at the same time increasing its altitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">in preparation for the great mountain ranges which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would soon be encountered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another hour Jopplin saw that they had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed the Ecuadorian frontier. Below were spread out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow-capped peaks of the Andes, and among them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if surrounded by a diadem of sparkling diamonds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be discerned the city of Quito, the Ecuadorian</seg><seg type="columnLine">capital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the scientist's suggestion, the pilot decreased the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine's speed and circled over the picturesque city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Andes. That a state of unwonted excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">reigned among the inhabitants was now clear. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then a strange thing happened. Startled by the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a muffled detonation toward the east, the scientist</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to see two army planes circling about the sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit of a broken cliff, far in the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" exclaimed the pilot excitedly, "they've</seg><seg type="columnLine">found him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hardly had the words been uttered when a thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish ray of light leaped suddenly from the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking the lower machine. For a moment the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be suspended lifeless in the air. Suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without warning, it was seen to crumple, and a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">later only a charred and twisted mass was plunging to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. Not the slightest noise accompanied its</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other plane, now warned of its danger, sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly from the scene, only to reappear a few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments later at a higher altitude. Circling above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">region of the disaster, the aviator carefully took aim</seg><seg type="columnLine">and released the deadly missile at his side. A few sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds later the air was split by a terrific concussion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the great cliff itself seemed to shake visibly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord!" cried Jopplin tensely, "they shouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do that. Once that Teranhoff and his secret are de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed, all hope for the world will be lost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" shrieked the pilot, his bloodless face turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more in the direction of the circling plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the space of a moment Jopplin saw nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">except a momentary spurt of blue. As the seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped by he doubted if this second discharge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange destroyer could have taken effect. Watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently through his binoculars, he saw a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">change come over the suspended plane. It did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to move; a thing wholly inanimate. Quite sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, all the fabric of the machine seemed to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solve into nothingness, leaving a bare, horribly distorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame. The aviator had completely vanished; yet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disabled frame-work remained suspended in mid-air!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing was astounding, incredible; nevertheless it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fact. His eyes were not deceiving him; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumbled, hideous thing, that had once been a delicately</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought mechanism, and human flesh was hanging un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported in the atmosphere, twenty-five thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the level of the sea! For an instant Jopplin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain reeled madly, then the man of science reappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Figuring hurriedly in his notebook his bewilderment</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave way to understanding. With blanched face he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned suddenly to his companion: "The time has come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What I have been expecting has at last come to pass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is no time for delay; we must land immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we are ever to touch the earth's surface again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first the pilot did not understand; then, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth gradually dawned upon him, his terror-stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance betrayed the fact that reason had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted from his already over-taxed brain. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE WORLD WENT MAD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">559</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">piercing cry of fear and madness the aviator jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose the belt that held him and jumped wildly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stunned and bewildered by the rash act of his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion, the professor gazed mechanically at the void</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, shuddering involuntarily at the thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">madman's fate. Then, struck by a sudden thought, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked behind him. The man had not fallen, but re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained suspended in the air! As the scientist realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other's real fate, he shuddered even more violently</seg><seg type="columnLine">than before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But in another instant all thoughts were driven sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly from his mind. The plane, by some freak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, was headed directly for the spot where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange battle had occurred but a few moments be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. Driven by its own motive power, the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to overcome the inertia which had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtaken the inanimate bodies overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Jopplin was no aeronaut, and as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already directed toward the one spot in the world that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wished to reach, he made no attempt to control the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine's course. Moreover, due to the almost total</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence of gravity, his descent was far from being</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipitous. Describing a long, majestic curve, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane scraped against the side of a huge boulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">careened drunkenly upon its side, and finally came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest. To the scientist it seemed as if the earth it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self was coming up to meet him--a shock, a crash--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, oblivion. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN Jopplin regained consciousness, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of the sound of voices. Bruised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken, he lay half supported by a crumbling wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, which he surmised was hiding him from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speakers upon the other side. The American listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently, recognizing the language to be Russian. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though possessing some knowledge of that tongue, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning of what was being said came to him only in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments. Yes, that was it, something about a sphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man had undoubtedly mentioned a sphere. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor recalled the accounts he had read in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers. The sphere, he decided, could be no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the space-ship, whose launching was to cost the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth so dearly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In another moment, however, all doubt was dispelled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cautiously raising himself to a better position, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist peered through a small opening among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks. Before him, extending for a distance of per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps four hundred feet, was a level surface of pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. Resting motionless upon an elevated steel sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port, not more than a hundred feet away, loomed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge metallic object whose form closely resembled that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a prolate spheroid. Not the slightest sign of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speakers, however, was visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greatly puzzled, Jopplin gazed attentively at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene before him. Suddenly one of the voices spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. A single passage stood out clearly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My friends," the voice was saying, "the time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we have been so long preparing has at last ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived. My last observation shows that at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen minutes gravity at the equator will have prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically ceased. You know what this means. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing within the ship is in order. Only one thing re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains to be done,--to impart to the ship its initial</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentum. To you, Comrade Morensky, shall fall the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor of liberating the force which is to set in mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the most stupendous enterprise that has even been</seg><seg type="columnLine">undertaken by man. Let us drink, my friends, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">success of our journey, and also to the memory of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As the full import of this last sentence became clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the professor's mind, a look of mingled awe and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder spread over his countenance. The speaker,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom the American believed to be no other than Teran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoff himself, could have meant only one thing; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rotational acceleration which was even now</seg><seg type="columnLine">causing tremendous upheavals upon the earth, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no end. Once safely launched into space and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">goal attained, the occupants of the spheroid would</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the world to its own fate. The unknown mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anism which they had set into operation would con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue its deadly work unchecked. In less than an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly half of the world's inhabitants would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims of a fate infinitely more dreadful than had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever been conceived by a Dante or a Milton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Involuntarily the American shuddered, and an icy</seg><seg type="columnLine">chill seemed to be clutching at his heart. Slowly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin features of America's foremost astrophysicist be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came hard and grim, and into his clear gray eyes came</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expression which had never been seen in classroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">or laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment he was startled by the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of two men, who were standing at a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance of only six feet from the protecting wall. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant later the mystery of their appearance was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled by the emergence of a third man from behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden turn in the ledge which the professor sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to lead into some natural passageway beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With quick strides the three Russians advanced to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the metal sphere, the surface of which they in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly subjected to a rapid examination. Apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied with the result of their scrutiny, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men turned a small lever attached to the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. At his touch what appeared to be a panel swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, disclosing an aperture just suffciently large to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit the passage of a man. Without a moment's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitation or a backward glance, the men entered into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior of the ship. In another instant the panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">had closed behind them, and to all outward appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances everything remained the same as before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly the moments passed, and Jopplin's impatience</seg><seg type="columnLine">became almost unbearable with the suspense. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sudden start, he realized that the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was no longer resting upon its support. Next, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled by its steady growing momentum, the sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now a hundred feet in the air. As the rate of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cession increased the shining object disk-like as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose into space, grew rapidly smaller. In another mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment only a tiny dark speck was visible in the sky.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The space-ship had at last started upon its journey!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the afternoon of September 27th, 1938, the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Quito, Ecuador, was visited by a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomena never paralleled in the history of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Although warning of the impending catastrophe</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been broadcast throughout the civilized world, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the higher classes of the Ecuadorian capital had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to realize the full significance of the Russian</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist's experiment. The disaster, consequently, fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a populace almost wholly unprepared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first warnings of what was to follow were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">inappreciable in their effects as to cause but little</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety. In fact, the people's only sensation was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strange exhilaration and vigor. Even the heaviest</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor could be done with an amazingly small amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exertion. Children found running and jumping pecu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liarly attractive. Small boys and girls could be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversing the most prodigious distances with leaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bounds, sometimes rising several feet above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. To the ignorant, these manifestations, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious, offered no special cause for alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As time went by, however, this feeling of lightness</seg><seg type="columnLine">560</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grew less agreeable. In fact, even the most thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less began to realize that after all, weight may be an</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent thing. Drivers of automobiles soon discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered that it was virtually impossible for their machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold the road; in all parts of the city tramcars</seg><seg type="columnLine">were leaving the rails. Horse-drawn vehicles, also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not immune to the mysterious influence, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of madly galloping steeds rising from six to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight feet in the air after every step was sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling to arouse even the indifferent Latins from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their traditional apathy. Finally, after the occurrence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of several serious accidents, all traffic was suspended</seg><seg type="columnLine">by order of the authorities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Further developments of the phenomena were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">long in making themselves felt. As the wind which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been blowing steadily from the east increased in</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence, strange things began to happen. Newspapers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hats, and parasols were snatched from their owners</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carried to unprecedented heights, and never re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. The atmosphere overhead was now darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">with flying objects of every description; loose boards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing, multi-colored birds, and even domestic poul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try, all remained suspended in the air. A workman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a false step upon a scaffolding high overhead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly lost his balance. But instead of being dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pieces upon the pavement below, he was seen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">float gracefully through the atmosphere, carried upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wings of the wind. In mingled wonder and stupe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction, hundreds of spectators saw the man become a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere speck upon the western horizon, only to disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear completely from view an instant later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at this moment that the city's inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to understand the fate which was in store for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. With shrieks of terror and dismay the panic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken populace took refuge within the walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest buildings. Among many the illogical idea pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vailed that the civil authorities might possibly have</seg><seg type="columnLine">jurisdiction over natural phenomena as well as over</seg><seg type="columnLine">human affairs, and fear-maddened mobs, made up of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of persons, forced their way into municipal</seg><seg type="columnLine">institutions in search of protection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The authorities, however, had no protection to offer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Due to the effects of lessened gravity and lower atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pheric pressure upon the human frame, a weird, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">definable sensation of nausea and physical helplessness</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended upon even the most robust individuals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within the great buildings the most ghastly scenes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being witnessed. In some of the buildings many</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons were already hanging suspended, unable either</seg><seg type="columnLine">to descend or ascend higher. Others, terrified by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grewsome and unnatural sight, were clinging desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately to tables, chairs, and every other available piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of furniture. Men vainly endeavored to throw them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves flat upon the floor, only to find that it was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for them to regain their feet. Mothers, clutch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing frantically at their children, were horrified to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover that their feet were no longer touching the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To add to the panic, the sun, which had long since</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared, now began to rise in the east, announc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the advent of another day. Yet according to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">known standards of time the sun should still have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shining in the west, not far from the meridian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At a rate which rendered its movement almost per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptible to the naked eye, the brilliant orb of day</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily advanced along the ecliptic. Barely had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first lurid streaks of dawn shot across the sky when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun's position seemed to be a quarter of the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the zenith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Suddenly, a large stone edifice began to totter upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">its foundation. As it occupants became aware of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement their stupefaction was succeeded by cries of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">horror and consternation. Gradually the heavy build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing freed itself from its supports, rising perceptibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the ground. In another instant scores of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings could be seen rocking under the same in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence. The entire city of Quito, it appeared, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to leave forever the planet which had given it</seg><seg type="columnLine">birth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine"># # # #</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN cities situated in the temperate zones, scenes of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat different character were taking place. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth's rotational speed had increased, many start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling and extraordinary changes had occurred. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon discovered that railway systems could no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">be controlled, and reports of accidents were rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">multiplying. Northbound trains found progress virtu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally impossible, while those running south were pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipitated at such speed that the most powerful brakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of little avail. As a matter of fact, every mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able object seemed to possess an irresistible inclination</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move southward; rivers running north, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitherto been but sluggish streams, now were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verted into raging torrents; levees were broken and</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks were undermined and whole territories were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">undated. Even the human body was not free from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same impulse, and in order to maintain their feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">people were obliged to lean forward at an angle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly 40°. That is to say, in facing north. * Facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">south, the conditions were exactly reversed, and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one traveling in this direction had the same sensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he had been descending a steep and endless hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite the seeming futility of any measures they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might take, civil and military authorities were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to do everything in their power to minimize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effects of the disaster. Accordingly, as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity tests had shown the imminence of the peril,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all buildings of more than two stories in height had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been evacuated by order of the police.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In New York, the exodus from the great buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the downtown districts had been especially impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive. The streets were soon veritable rivers of surg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing humanity. All traffic by vehicles had long since</seg><seg type="columnLine">been suspended, and only the quick tread of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet upon the walks and pavement could , now be heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the windows overhead police officers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting orders through megaphones, directing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people to form into lines. Nor were these precautions</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnecessary. Already the increasing congestion had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowed up the progress of the marching columns ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terially. Manhattan Island, which the authorities had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided must be totally abandoned, offered the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty. The giant bridges connecting the island to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mainland and to Long Island, were already filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their greatest capacity, yet it was doubtful whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manhattan's three million inhabitants could escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the doomed area before the destruction would</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In many districts, in which all order had been for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten, crowds of fear-maddened men and women were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting desperately to make their way through streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had already become too narrow, while overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">the increasing inclination of the tall buildings gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning that there was no time to lose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On lower Broadway scenes of indescribable confusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">were taking place. As the solid mass of humanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept forward, the steeple of Trinity Church was seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be reeling drunkenly upon its base. Suddenly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if pushed by an invisible hand, the narrow spire tot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, swayed, and collapsed, bearing beneath it</seg><seg type="columnLine">scores of persons and obstructing traffic in all direc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">•In the Southern Hemisphere these directions were, of course, completely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reversed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE WORLD WENT MAD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">561</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tiona. Stunned and bewildered, people looked above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to see the sky completely hidden by dark and</seg><seg type="columnLine">menacing shapes. In the distance, the form of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woolworth Building, giant of skyscrapers, could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">discerned, its colossal tower writhing helplessly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip of the invisible destroyer. The destruction of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">masterpiece of modern engineering skill seemed now</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a matter of a few moments. A mass of steel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">concrete weighing over 200,000,000 pounds would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing down upon the highly organized, sensitive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">organic matter which was pulsating with life be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UPON recovering from the surprise occasioned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sudden disappearance of the spheroid, Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Jopplin's first thought was of the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious hiding-place which had been abandoned by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russian scientists but a few moments before. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">great difficulty, making his way to the ledge from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the three men had emerged, he perceived an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening which appeared to lead into a sort of cave or</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural passageway. Clinging desperately to the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to resist the insidious influence which threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened to unbalance him and lift him off his feet, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American decided that his only hope of entering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern lay in reaching the ceiling and walking along</seg><seg type="columnLine">its surface. Putting his decision into instant practice</seg><seg type="columnLine">by catching hold of the jutting rocks which lined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel on either side he crawled to the top of the cave</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started toward the interior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the space of a few moments the blackness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel seemed to increase; then, almost impercept-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ibly at first, but with ever-increasing dictinctness, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint glimmer of light could be seen far in the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance. Animated by a newly born hope, the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Btruggled on, oblivious to everything, except the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminosity which lay before him. As the passageway</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly widened, he was rewarded by a sight which</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him catch his breath in amazement. Not more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than forty feet ahead, illuminated by a dazzling glare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of almost supernatural brilliance, was a huge subter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranean chamber over fifty feet in height and at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred feet in diameter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the scientist, a casual glance was sufficient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inform him that the cavern had been the recent scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">of laboratory work upon a large scale. Rows of pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erful storage batteries, motors, and various electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">appliances--whose framework was bolted securely to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bolid rock beneath--still occupied their respective posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions upon the floor; while against the ceiling, where,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ns the professor at once understood, they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown the moment that gravity had been conquered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by centrifugal force, were lying dozens of cylindrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">containers, delicately wrought tubes and other pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of apparatus in an evident state of disorder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the eyes of the astrophysicist rested upon none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these things. Standing motionless, as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were under the influence of some hypnotic spell, Henry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jopplin was staring straight below him. In the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the floor of the weird laboratory, and, as in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case of the machines which surrounded it, securely</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened to the rock beneath, stood an object which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be impossible to describe in any precise terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of known science. Although its general aspect some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what resembled a huge, multi-polar dynamo, at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">point all resemblance ceased. Despite its great, curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously shaped armature, the machine was clearly no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary dynamo such as had ever been known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentieth century mechanics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It soon became apparent to the scientist that, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything was to be accomplished, he must descend to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor at once. Cautiously making his way down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest wall he at length found himself within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few feet of a row of small pipes which led directly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the laboratory. At this point the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor was confronted with a sudden difficulty. Inas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as there was not only a total absence of gravity</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this particular region of the earth, but an actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">predominance of centrifugal force, he would, if attempt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to walk upon the cavern's floor without assistance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">be thrown immediately back upon the ceiling, with per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps disastrous results. Only one alternative remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">--to make his way upside down by clinging to fixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">supports. Glancing hurriedly about him, his eyes rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the row of pipes beneath. In another instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jopplin was making his way hand over hand toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the laboratory and the strange mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it contained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the scientist drew nearer he suddenly became</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious of a low, droning sound in his ears. Simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously, a terrifying conviction impressed itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcibly upon his mind: The machine, whatever it was,1'</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still functioning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the trained eye of a physicist, the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined the thing before him. Almost intuitively the</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization came to him that it was solely upon this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of inanimate metal that depended the fate of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">world--a planet supporting nearly two billion feeling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoning beings like himself.....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Methodically Jopplin considered the various hypo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theses that presented themselves to his mind, discard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing each in turn as it failed to account for the data</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. Mentally he reviewed every aspect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teranhoff's startling experiments and the long series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomena to which these had given rise. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">make no false step; even though the passing of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute might now mean the sacrifice of thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives, yet the duty of the man of science was clear--</seg><seg type="columnLine">his conclusion must be accurate: there was no time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All at once the scientist's thin countenance was lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a sudden conviction. Recalling an independent in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigation made in his senior year, at college upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little understood subject of terrestrial magnetism, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true solution of the mystery was apparent. The diurnal</seg><seg type="columnLine">oscillation of the magnetic compass, the variation in</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of the earth's magnetic field, the periodic</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting of the agonic lines upon the terrestrial surface,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines on which the magnetic needle points due north, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">accountable seismic phenomena invariably accompanied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with abnormal manifestation of aurorae, all the baf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling and inexplicable phenomena of polarity--all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">and much more could be easily accounted for in tha</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the Russian's experiments. No doubt could now</seg><seg type="columnLine">be entertained that the earth's core, many times more</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense than the crust and consisting almost wholly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron and nickel, was in reality a gigantic magnet--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnet which could be made to serve a variety of pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses when acted upon by the proper agent. Teranhoff's</seg><seg type="columnLine">method, beautiful for its simplicity, had been merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shift the magnetic fields, by means of electro-mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netic currents, in such manner as to accelerate the ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation of the central nucleus and thus cause a conse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent increase in the rotational speed of the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">lithosphere. *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment the professor's indecision had</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely vanished. Examining the great machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">more minutely he discovered that this dynamo-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure was in turn coupled with what appeared to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curious development of the ordinary vertical motor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some distance apart, half hidden by the strange lum-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*Thc solid part of the earth.

The passing of hydrogen gas through in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">candescent tungsten filaments at temperatures un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed of by older orthodox science led to but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion--the production of atomic or activated hy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drogen. Beyond that, much still remained unexplained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but upon one point there could be no doubt: an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ormous, inconceivable amount of energy was being de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped within the subterranean laboratory--energy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact, sufficient to throw the whole world into chaos</seg><seg type="columnLine">if its devastating effects were not immediately checked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following an intricate system of wiring, the Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can suddenly came to a stop. Before him, in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their many peculiarities, stood an unmistakable po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentiometer and switchboard. With a shout of triumph</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jopplin rapidly examined the wiring system which led</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the switch. Here, he felt, lay the key to the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem. In a few moments, at the most, he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to release the earth from the relentless forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were destroying it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, at the very moment of his triumph, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist realized that he was already too late.

And desperate as this chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, the American lost no time in coming to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision. Clinging with one hand to the support that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held him, he made a connection and turned one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">levers before him. Simultaneously there came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of grinding motors, a blinding flash of multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored light swept the laboratory from end to end, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air became heavy with electrical discharges--then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy, numbing jar that seemed the end of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">things . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the world was saved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YES, the world had been saved.

And this recoil, although it had sunk thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of ships upon the sea and demolished millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings on land, had on the whole been for the good</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet's inhabitants. Never again will terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">days be measured in units of twenty-four hours; yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither will the sun race across the heavens with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickening speed it exhibited during the twelve hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">of terror inaugurated by Ivan Teranhoff's mad ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eighteen hours and fifty-one minutes is the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">which will henceforth be consumed by the third planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the solar system in making one complete rotation</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon its axis.

After the first effects of the jar</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had shaken the world, had worn off, scientific ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peditions had set out by aircraft from practically every</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation upon the American continent. The professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after having wandered for over a day and a half, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last been discovered (by a famous American flyer)</seg><seg type="columnLine">within only a few miles of the spot where once had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood the lost city of Quito. This much; at least, has</seg><seg type="columnLine">long been known to every newspaper reader in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What has not been divulged by the press, and what</seg><seg type="columnLine">is known only to the scientific circles which have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived Jopplin's professional report, are the reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">which led to the latter's abandonment of the subter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranean laboratory before the earth's rotational period</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been restored to its normal length. This, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist has repeatedly stated to his most intimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">colleagues, is a thorn upon his conscience which will</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue to prick him for the rest of his life. Not, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, that, from a worldly standpoint the professor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">course was not entirely justified. The facts, briefly, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">these:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No sooner had Jopplin reversed the electro-magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">currents and felt the jar that followed, than he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself lying flat upon the cavern's floor. Realizing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once that his returned bodily weight meant the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">storation of gravity to the earth, he had assumed (an</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumption, he now claims, which he had no right to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make) that his plan had been entirely successful and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nothing further remained to be done. It was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, only natural that upon experiencing the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremor foretelling the earthquake which was subse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently to destroy the entire mountainside, he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have decided to leave the laboratory to its own fate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet, even after the first shock, Professor Jopplin</seg><seg type="columnLine">states in his report that he remained sufficiently long</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cavern to discover that all the motors, as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN THE WORLD WENT MAD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">563</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as the apparatus from which they derived their energy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been rendered useless, owing to the terrific strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been placed upon them, past all hope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">repair. As it was, the professor was quite badly shaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and escaped the final crash only by the rarest good</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, however, he has become obsessed with the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is solely his fault that the earth has lost over</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hours of its normal day. In fact, the plaudits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the multitude, the congratulations of his friends, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assurances of his colleagues, are alike incapable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ridding him of this conviction. For this reason it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only too clear that the professor, in spite of the warmth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his first reception, could never become a popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero. Indeed, he feels that it is he who owes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world an apology, rather than that the world1; should</seg><seg type="columnLine">owe him gratitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a short stay in the United States Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jopplin again sailed for Valparaiso--this time by air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane--in order to carry on the investigations which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been so rudely interrupted.

For Craig's</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations, although they kept the letter of the law at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, were absolutely merciless in driving possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivals to the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Craig's interest in such methods was eminently per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal for he and his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany's three other direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors controlled all the stock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Starting with a few thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand dollars capital, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his three partners had</seg><seg type="columnLine">built up the present im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mense business. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an invention -- an auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic airplane stabilizer--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which the company</seg><seg type="columnLine">owned the sole patent</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights. Just where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had obtained the invention</seg><seg type="columnLine">was never disclosed al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the public com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monly supposed that Craig</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the originator, a supposition, by the way, that Craig</seg><seg type="columnLine">never denied. Now as he read the inventor's letter over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he again smiled. Well, if they could get hold of an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention like that, the public would have something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning to the phone, Craig called up each of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">three associates in turn, and requested them to attend</seg><seg type="columnLine">a meeting at his office that evening on very important</seg><seg type="columnLine">business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the hour arrived, the president turned .to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other directors and read the inventor's letter which nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urally caused quite a sensation. While some doubted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the inventor had really accomplished what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">566</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, they all agreed that the matter was of too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much possible importance to neglect. Therefore, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following evening the president's limousine containing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four men drove out to 77 Oakhurst Avenue, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the inventor's residence. The place was located</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the outskirts of the city, and proved to be a mod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est dwelling of two and a half stories, located among</seg><seg type="columnLine">some gloomy pines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon ringing the bell, the door was opened by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elderly man apparently sixty-five or seventy years of age.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wore a flowing white beard and on his head was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">close fitting skull cap. His piercing gray eyes surveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the party, finally resting upon Craig.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Craig and associates, I presume? Step right in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen, I've been expecting you," he said. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">name's Norton." Craig started--where had he li^rd</seg><seg type="columnLine">that peculiar ringing voice before? But the memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">eluded him and the inventor was speaking again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are all familiar with my letter, of course, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">are anxious to see my--pardon the natural pride--</seg><seg type="columnLine">epoch-making invention. I have the model in my work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop upstairs. If you will kindly follow me," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">courteously, "I shall be pleased to give you a demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stration and explain such things as are necessary to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper understanding of the value of my invention."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Turning abruptly, he led the way up several flights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs to the upper half story, and paused before a door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unlocking this he switched on a shaded light in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the low-ceilinged room, and entered, eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by his guests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The single light that Norton had switched on was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaded that it cast most of its illumination on a mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive table beneath, leaving the rest of the room in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parative obscurity. Craig half unconsciously glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and was surprised at the extreme lowness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling, but quickly remembering that this was the up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per half story of the house, and that therefore the ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing must necessarily be low, he turned his eyes to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Resting on the table was a metallic cigar-shaped ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject, looking for all the world like a submarine without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a conning tower. It was about eight feet long and wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">in proportion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The model, gentlemen," said Norton, passing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand caressingly over the shining metal. "This is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exact representation of the way I shall build my pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger airboat, with the exception that on this model,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forward-driving apparatus is left out. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this boat I can show you the main principle--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">annulling of gravity's effect. Please be seated."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little party, afire with expectation, seated them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves about the table and watched the inventor intently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will notice" Norton continued, "the utter ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sence of cumbersome planes, also how the shape of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airboat is made to offer the least possible resistance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air when traveling at high speeds." Here he paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sliding back a cover in the top of the model, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached inside and slightly moved a small lever across</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dial. Withdrawing his hand, he watched the boat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For an instant it rested quietly, then amid a gasp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment from the little circle of watchers, it arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">as lightly and noiselessly as a balloon, and mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily to a height of about three feet above the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then remained there absolutely motionless. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expressions of amazement had subsided a little, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor reached up and again touched the little lever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boat settled gracefully back to the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now will two of you gentlemen kindly sit astride</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine?" Norton asked. His request was quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">complied with and he again slid back the metal door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time shoving the lever far over on the dial. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily and as silently as before the cigar-shaped object</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose until the director's heads touched the ceiling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton then mounted a chair and reversing the lever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually, the machine descended and came to rest on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table. The two men dismounted from their metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pegasus, and Craig said, "Looks good, but now let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a little explanation of just how your machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcomes gravity. You know sometimes things are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not what they seem," this half sneeringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Norton's eyes flashed for an instant, but he said in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a controlled voice, "You will find no trickery connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my invention; in fact," significantly, "I am sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the evening is over, you will be more than con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced of its genuineness!" He paused. Again Craig</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a fleeting impression that he had somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard this man speak before. But rack his brain as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would, he couldn't remember the incident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will pardon me," Norton resumed, "if I digress</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little before I explain the really simple process by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I turn earth's attraction, as it were, against it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, thus leading to my most marvelous results. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary for your proper understanding of the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject," he said with what Craig thought concealed sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casm, "to recount a little personal history which hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened twenty-five weary years ago," he paused bitterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At that time I was a young man of thirty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, working as a mechanic in a factory which man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ufactured airplane propellers. I was happy and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tented in my work. I had a loving wife and little</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby boy to keep me cheered up and altogether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world looked rosy. Fortune seemed to favor me, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day I got an idea for a much needed invention</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an airplane, which I was sure would be a winner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wishing to be sure of the value of my idea, I con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulted with four of my associate mechanics who, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had every reason to believe, were honest faithful</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends." Here Norton looked keenly at his auditors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who squirmed uneasily beneath his glance. He con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, "They readily saw the importance of my idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and urged me strongly to go ahead with my plans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little did I suspect that they met that very evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">and planned not only to rob me of my invention, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put me forever out of the way as well." At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling of this remembrance, Norton's eyes grew som-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bre and threatening. A cold sensation started at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of Craig's spine and moved upward. That voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was knocking, knocking at his brain. Wilfully buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories began to awake--he gazed half fearfully at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his colleagues and he saw that they too were looking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">questioningly at him. Could this man be-? but no,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that was too absurd, a mere coincidence. Listen, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was speaking again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was the old, old story of the lamb and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolves. My so-called friends invited me to a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">party with the boys, drugged me, and stole my plans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I carried in my inside pocket. But mark you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not content with robbing me, they must needs put me</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the way, where my future outcries against</seg><seg type="columnLine">them could not be heard. So they took me down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the factory, drugged as I was, clubbed the watchman</seg><seg type="columnLine">into insensibility from behind, and left me before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company's safe with a kit of burglar's tools. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">presume they then notified the police, for there they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came and found me struggling to get up. They ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested me and with all that circumstantial evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">against me, I was sent to prison for ten years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE effect of Norton's story upon his auditors was</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling. The blood had slowly drained from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces of all of them and they had risen to their feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with straining eyes. That voice was now only too</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar--"You are--you are--!" they murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim Rodman, the man you heartlessly betrayed"</seg><seg type="columnLine">--his voice rose--"the man you sent to prison for ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">long weary years--leaving his wife and the baby to</seg><seg type="columnLine">die of privation and shame, while you, you damnable</seg><seg type="columnLine">slinking hypocrites, taking the fruits of my labors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GRAVITY KING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">567</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">made yourselves rich and powerful! Look at me, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man at sixty, broken with suffering and prison</seg><seg type="columnLine">indignities!" His voice broke with passion, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed quickly, "Now, however, I've got you where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want you, damn you 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be too sure," said Craig, whose hardened</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature had recovered from its temporary fear. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew an automatic from his coat pocket. "Stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside," he said, sneeringly, "I haven't time to listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your yelps further!" He strode to the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked it open, then stood petrified with amazement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gone was the narrow hallway--gone were the stairs--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room in which he stood, hung five thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in midair, far above the quiet moonlit streets of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. Craig's eyes bulged with fear and unbelief He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed them violently, thinking himself the victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a troubled dream. But no, it was reality--the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Mahomet's Coffin, hung suspended between Heaven</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ashen-faced, Craig turned and dropped into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, all the bluster taken out of him. "What in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fernal magic is this?" he whined. "Put me on earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, Rodman, and I'll do anything, give you any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Norton, or Rodman rather, as we will now call him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surveyed Craig contemptuously, "Whine, you cur,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whine. Just as I thought--like all traitors, you are a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coward at heart! Do you think that anything you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do now would erase those ten years of Hell</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my memory! Can you offer me anything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would resurrect my darling wife and babe from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness of eternal sleep! No! No! You've had your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fling--now you must pay--pay-" his voice shrilled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Craig shrank back as from a madman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, don't be afraid. I'm not going to kill you out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, you're going to be my guests for some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet." Then with mock politeness, "Pardon me, gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, for not relieving your curiosity as to your pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent aerial location sooner. I am certain you'd like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. You see this room you are in is really only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center section of my airboat, the 'Gravity King.'"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The men started. "Yes," resumed Rodman, "I merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">disguised it from the too curious gaze of passers-by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was very simple. I tore the roof off the long nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row room at the back of my house leaving the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walls intact. Within these protecting walls, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithful assistant and myself gradually assembled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">different sections of the 'Gravity King.' Consequently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of entering my workshop this evening, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed, you entered my airboat. As you perceive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this room is enclosed at each end by metal walls;</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond these partitions is housed the machinery for</seg><seg type="columnLine">raising and lowering the 'Gravity King,' and also for</seg><seg type="columnLine">propulsion. While you were so interestedly watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small model, my assistant was guiding our air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship 'high into the sky.'" He hesitated, then called,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, Harry!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A door in the forward compartment opened and a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">young man stepped into the chamber and looked coldly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Craig and his party. Craig noticed that it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man who had brought him the inventor's letter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he swore silently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is everything working all right, Harry?" Rodman</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Splendidly," said the other, "your instructions are</seg><seg type="columnLine">being carried out," this with a significant look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good," said Rodman, and his assistant disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These instructions, by the way," continued the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor grimly, "may prove of interest to you, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are concerning your future home." He watched their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces. "Would you care to know where that is? Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Far to the south of Tierra del Fuego, well within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the antartic circle, is a small island. It is well</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocked with game and seafowl, but it is absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">uninhabited, and is not even charted. As a peaceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to rest from civilization's strife, and to recuper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate shattered nerves, it is unexcelled. This island,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen," in a mocking tone, "you will grow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">love as the years roll by, for it is your future home."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then sternly, "You have proven yourselves unfit for</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization, so civilization casts you out to the beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you belong."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You devil," Craig shouted--"our business--our</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes--we'll pay anything, but don't bury us alive on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those God-forsaken antarctic islands!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too late," murmured Rodman, "did you think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that when you buried me alive between those cold bleak</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of San Quentin ?" He gave a short sardonic laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned on his heel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that, Craig's restraint blew up completely. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his revolver and aiming it at Rodman, shrieked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Turn around, damn you, and order that mechanician</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yours to take us home or I'll blow your brains</seg><seg type="columnLine">out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rodman turned smilingly, "Shoot, you coward, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have the nerve--but you haven't. You know only</seg><seg type="columnLine">too well if you shoot me you'll never'return to earth."</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaping suddenly forward he knocked Craig's weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">upwards. The pistol roared, but the bullet went over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rodman's head and pierced the forward compartment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At this, there came a sharp crack from the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the boat and the men were all hurled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor by a sudden upward lurch of the "Gravity King."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A yell came from the mechanician, "That bullet has</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken the control--we're shooting away from the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I can't stop it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men staggered to their feet and gazed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass. It was true! Insane terror filled their eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reason tottered, but the "Gravity King," unheed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, hurtled upward like a metallic demon released</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pit, and was lost forever in the illimitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaches of space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The End.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Next Issue of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be out on January 20th</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WORLD OF THE GIANT ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By H.

A little later we dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered a patrol of the reds approaching across an</seg><seg type="columnLine">area temporarily unguarded by the agricultural war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors. Rushing to the powder-train leading to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine in that spot, I fired it. The next moment only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a yawning hole in the sand and fragments of dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants remained to mark their attempt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I fear we are in a bad fix. We have little water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">little food, and the reds are in incredible numbers all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us. If only I could induce our agriculturalist</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors to rush the enemy. If only the reds would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come on and attack. But the agriculturalists developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fighters with one point in view and one only.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They produced creatures with fearful natural weapons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great strength, quick motions and utter lack of fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in doing so, they sacrificed all intelligence, all in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividuality and initiative. The reds, on the other hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to have developed even greater intelligence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greater instinct for military tactics than before, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet they have retained all their fighting characteristics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To attempt to make a sortie with the blacks would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">suicidal. My handful of savages would literally be</seg><seg type="columnLine">eaten up by the hordes of reds. And the latter have</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to keep beyond reach of our weapons. At first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows and slings did considerable execution among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, but now they have withdrawn just beyond range.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am beginning to feel that we are doomed. How I</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame myself for not having attempted our escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner. Had we made our preparations to blast the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel door a day earlier, we would now be out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley and safe. And now, with all prepared, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a spark needed to open our way to freedom, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are more helpless, more prisoners than ever. But of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what avail to regret what cannot be remedied? There</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a chance, a very slender chance, that we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape through the lines of the red ants under cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">of darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They are strictly diurnal and are dull and semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dormant at night. But they are so sensitive to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest sound or vibration, to sounds or perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">scents undetectable to humans, that such an attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a most perilous and desperate undertaking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, I feel that it would be a cowardly, despicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">act to desert these blacks who look to me for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">salvation. My presence in the valley--though Heaven</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows I had no wish to remain here--has been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of all this trouble and warfare. I am in a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible, and in addition, I have developed a hatred</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the reds more intense than I would have believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. To me they seem living incarnations of every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing evil. And yet I suppose they are merely follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out their natural instincts, are merely fulfilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">their destinies as planned by the Creator. Most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I am worried and troubled over Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have got him into this mess, and he, poor boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be sacrificed on the altar of Science because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his faithfulness and devotion to me. My own life is</seg><seg type="columnLine">of little consequence. I am well along in years, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done my part--small as it is--in the scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and it is no worse to meet the end here at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands of savage insects, than elsewhere at the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of savage men, or by some accident or disease. I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hold life cheaply, but in many ways I would prefer</seg><seg type="columnLine">death to longer imprisonment in this valley. My great-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">est regret would be that all I have learned would perish</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, that the place would remain unknown and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsuspected indefinitely, that no fellow scientist would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to complete my work and thoroughly investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate the marvelous ruins of the pre-historic white race.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had hoped, planned, to return with a large party and</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper equipment, but I can see no hope of that now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could face my future, my probable death with equa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nimity, if I could only be sure that my notes would</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the outer world. But I fear that Tom, if I fall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might forget his promise and would remain, faithful</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE suspense is getting unbearable. I am de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined that in a short time I will force the</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue. Unless the reds change their tactics and attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, I shall lead an attack upon them. The inaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">is more trying than the most desperate hand-to-hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	# »</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have been thinking deeply upon the matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom's escape. I believe he, with his latent savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">instincts and his African ability to move stealthily in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness, might get safely through the red ants'</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines, especially as there seems to be an area to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west that is not so closely guarded and patrolled as</seg><seg type="columnLine">elsewhere. If he could do this, if he could reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer world with my notebooks, my own fate would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not matter so much. Moreover, if he could reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outposts of civilization--and I have no doubt that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do this if he gets through to Tupec--he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">summon aid and return with a large party equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fire-arms. If I still live when they arrive, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be rescued and none the worse off; the valley can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be pacified, the red ants annihilated and the scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">world enriched by a study of this place. My life may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sacrificed, it is true, but if Tom remains and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reds are triumphant, his lot would be worse than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. He would be made a slave of the inhuman</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsters and treated far more brutally than the ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary slaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must use every argument to induce him to attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get away without me. I must play upon his terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">of falling into the slavers' clutches again. I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise that if the reds are defeated I will follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; but the all important matter is to save him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fate that I feel sure will be his if he remains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to carry my notebooks to my fellow men. I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not feel at all confident that I can induce or force</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom to do this. But he is obedient, he is brave, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is resourceful and it is my only hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DECIDED Tom will attempt to reach Tupec. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">will go through the tunnel as planned and I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve he can make it. Giving him my notes as only</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof.

All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the science--the entire skill of the research depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the company, was put to work and yet, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of a week, nothing was learned, and; another</seg><seg type="columnLine">week of disastrous errors followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the strain of events, Hiram Smith died. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter, Mirabella, at once took charge of Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versal Utilities. Her first act was to call a meeting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her Board of Directors and speak to them. She began</seg><seg type="columnLine">her address:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Over two hundred years ago an ancestor of mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to breed stenographers. He succeeded rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. He not only bred like to like but eventually had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal of inbreeding. In this last generation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost every husband and wife were cousins of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree. No individuality was allowed and no initia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive; he merely bred for accuracy and speed. All of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have followed in his footsteps. You have mated</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings as if they were rats or cattle. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had studied the nervous systems of horses and dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">that have been bred in this way for many generations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would have suspected the trouble with your pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent generation of stenographers. Any dog fancier</seg><seg type="columnLine">will tell you how careful he has to be of white collies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fox terriers. One of your community doctors</seg><seg type="columnLine">last year suspected what was going to happen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Over eighty per cent of your stenographers have</seg><seg type="columnLine">nocturnal epilepsy. That means that they have con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsions which occur at night during their sleep. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tonic and clonic muscular movements, they drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a deep sleep, from which they only waken in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dress, eat breakfast and go to work. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no consciousness of the convulsion and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of it. On account of the intense muscular</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity during the attack, they are tired, sore and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruised, when they start to work. That in itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">would produce fatigue and errors, but in addition, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in epilepsy, especially the nocturnal type, a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite deterioration of the higher mental faculties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These unfortunates become dull, listless, incapable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly specialized cerebration. They degenerate into</seg><seg type="columnLine">listless animals. In their work, dress and speech, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">give plain evidence of this dullness of the mind. Emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionally they change, become quarrelsome, abusive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">indolent. This is what hn= (appened to your office</seg><seg type="columnLine">force. Two hundred years ,.bo my ancestor started</seg><seg type="columnLine">it; you have tried to carry out his plans--to breed</seg><seg type="columnLine">stenographers. Instead, you have bred a race of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented epileptics. My medical friends, who are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your employ as physicians to the Colony children, tell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me that almost all the little children are showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite signs of the same nervous disease. You were</seg><seg type="columnLine">.not told of it sooner, because they were afraid of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">father."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chairman of the Board looked dully at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young woman. Then he roused himself to action.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How did you learn all this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! the doctor who made the discovery was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">colony child. For some reason, your special foods and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glandular preparations did not work on him and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tenth year he was taken away from his parents</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put in the home of common people. During those</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten years he saw a great deal of the colony life--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to play with the other children, and spend the'</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights with them. Things happened during the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could not understand, but he remembered them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially when he started to study medicine. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">he graduated, he worked for Universal Utilities as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their Colony physicians, and his observations there</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him positive of the presence of nocturnal epilepsy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since then the disease has developed rapidly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Is there no cure?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "None whatever. Universal Utilities has on its hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and conscience ten thousand epileptics and their chil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dren. All that can be done is to allow the defective</seg><seg type="columnLine">race to die out. You will have to reorganize your entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">office force--go back to the old system of incompetent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">error-making stenographers who, in spite of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faults, are at least intensely human."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Chairman, in his indignation at a woman's talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing so disrespectfully and at such length to a dignified</seg><seg type="columnLine">Board of Directors, demanded what the result would be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Under the stress of reorganization," Mirabella calm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly replied, "Universal Utilities will lose over eighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent of its business. The time will come, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, when once again it will function smoothly, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions similar to its competitors. I will try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the lives of the new stenographers happy, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">never again will any effort be made to interfere with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the normal progress of nature in the breeding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings. Tho unfortunate epileptics will be well</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared for, but will die rapidly, and in twenty-five years</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colonies will be converted into suburban homes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for normal workers from the great city."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Enough of this outrage!" stormed the chairman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This meddling physician you speak of--who is he?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Where is he? We'll teach him-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In reply, Mirabella Smith simply called a young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the back of the room where he had been silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening to the entire proceedings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is my husband, Dr. Carleton Thoney," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said softly. "He used to be a colony child, but Provi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence made him a healthy physician instead of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">epileptic stenographer. Together, we will do all we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can, not only to make Universal Utilities a great busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness once more, but also to make full amends for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">errors its leaders have committed in the past."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The End.</seg><seg type="columnLine">570</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Editorials from Our Readers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rpHIS being your publication, you, the reader, have certain ideas, not only about this publication, but about scientifiction as well.

Put a jungle sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, well versed in the ways of the jungle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in primitive living, down in the midst of a jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">minus weapons or companions and he is imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately at the mercy of nearly any wild animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that cares to attack. He cannot outrun nor best</seg><seg type="columnLine">In combat any animal of equal size nor many</seg><seg type="columnLine">much smaller.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">superiors in strength and speed are summarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispatched at a distance that precludes possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility of injury to himself, and the lowly club,</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's first auxiliary weapon, is still suffcient</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection against the average reptile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Why do not other animals do likewise?

Undoubtedly there was a large ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of luck attached--something in the unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">past that deprived him of all defensive means ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept those that he might conceive. Since lie was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to use his brain in his fight for life, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only natural that the brain would develop</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of all proportion to other parts of the body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the breast muscles of birds, the leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles of swift animals or the horn of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhinoceros have developed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Brain, however, develops, not directly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">time or use, but, we might say, as a mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matical power of time and use.

The more the brain developed, the faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">it developed; and, of course, the faster it de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped, the more it developed.

The evolution of</seg><seg type="columnLine">•the type really begins with stories such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Scheherazade's Thousand and Second Tale,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mesmeric Revelation," and "The Balloon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hoax."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For fifteen years after Poe there was a little fic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of this kind written. In 1862, however, Jules</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verne turned his pen toward the scientific story</seg><seg type="columnLine">and published "Five Weeks in a Balloon." This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was followed by a "Trip to the Center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth" (1864), "From the Earth to the Moon"</seg><seg type="columnLine">(1865), "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sea" (1869), "The English at the North Pole"</seg><seg type="columnLine">(1870), and "Around the World in Eighty Days"</seg><seg type="columnLine">(1872). In these books, together with "Hector</seg><seg type="columnLine">Servadac" (1877), were begun the scientific typo</seg><seg type="columnLine">©f fiction and though their structure has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">modified, their subject-matter expanded, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">craftsmanship developed, they remain almost per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect models of their kind, and they will always</seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;o remain, because their fundamental psychologi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal qualities--the very essence of their appeal--</seg><seg type="columnLine">embody the animating and motivating forces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this branch of fiction.

In the same year he wrote "The Won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful Visit."

Those three authors</seg><seg type="columnLine">are of high order, but their stories appear so</seg><seg type="columnLine">seldom in the Monthly and Quarterly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would believe they're lost.
