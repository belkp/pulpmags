This story is not in exact line with the general run of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science-fiction--but it is good science and it creates one of the finest</seg><seg type="columnLine">word pictures I have ever read.

You and I have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">many magazines become monotonous because of SAMENESS. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the danger which is constant to any magazine where the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who occupies the editor's chair is not an editor--and there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">many such.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   If one story appeals UNANIMOUSLY to a reading audience as</seg><seg type="columnLine">GREAT, I feel it my duty to avoid another story similar in style and</seg><seg type="columnLine">background, lest the very things that made the first appeal destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the value of BOTH as interesting reading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   If the story contains the germ of a new and thought-provoking</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea, I am prejudiced in its favor. Thus I classify "The Isotope</seg><seg type="columnLine">Men" with its superscientific projection of actual isotope experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentation; and ''Strange City" with its intriguing electrical "life</seg><seg type="columnLine">transfer" which links closely to the theory of life held by the late</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thomas Edison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   To balance this presentation of idea stories, we seek and find</seg><seg type="columnLine">an imaginative science-adventure in "Smothered Seas." To com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete the balance "Blue Magic" carries on. And the spaceways are</seg><seg type="columnLine">represented, and the distant planets, and psychological science--</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shorts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Thus a magazine is made, keened, and put together.

She--or some one, at least--</seg><seg type="columnLine">was home, for the library lights were</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing. He ignored the slow auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic elevator, and dashed up the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">flights of steps to her floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He arrived in front of her door</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathless and perspiring.

There was a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den silence in the room beyond; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, after a considerable interval, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of footsteps. Sally herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the door, her face seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained and tense. But she smiled as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she recognized Lister.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dick!" she exclaimed. "What's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter? You're breathless!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strode past her. The room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty of occupants, save for Sally and</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.

Then, suddenly, her mood</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing, she moved close to him, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up at him out of innocent, dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. "You trust me, don't you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Heaven knows I want to!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her lovely, provocative lips smiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then kiss me!" she whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He obeyed, fiercely. As always, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips burned like soft fire, but, suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she threw back her head, and thrust her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands against him, as though to push</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from his embrace. One of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet finger nails drew a sharp gash</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his throat. With hurt surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes, he released her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You--were hurting me," she ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained, apologetically.

"I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry I scratched you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's nothing," he muttered. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously dizzy--no wonder, he thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the grip of such violent and opposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions. But abruptly he found him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self sitting in a chair with his head on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands, and the room seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gyrate around him like the cabin of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">copter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through a haze of dizziness he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man's voice, and then Sally's in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer. "No, no," she said. "This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much better. If I'd- called you there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been a fight and a disturb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, and see how peacefully he sinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">into stupor "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I bow to you, Kazarovna," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a further interval before he per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived that Sally Amber was sitting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly smoking, beside the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">piloted the machine, and that he him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self was handcuffed very effectively to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aluminum arms of his seat. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">head ached dully. Then, full realiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion dawned upon him. He was a pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner in the hands of agents of the Khan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His movement caught the girl's at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention.

"I'm sorry, Dick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drugging you was necessary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then it's true!" he groaned. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the Nightshade--a sneaking Asiatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">spy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like a sneaking American spy," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">retorted.

Or hadn't you noticed that ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had, of course.

"I've sent this one with a fake</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">message to Plotkin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Lister followed her up yet another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flight of steps, and emerged suddenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•	into starlight. They had attained the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">roof of the structure, and he glanced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">apprehensively at the lights of Harbin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all around. Sally was slipping toward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a copter, a tiny, single-man observer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Quick!" she breathed, "get in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Both of us?" He frowned doubt-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fully at the tiny craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We must. For I have to show you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what to do. This alone would not carry,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you far."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He crowded in beside her. The tiny</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cabin swung like a pendulum as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vertical screw whirred and whined, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bored its way heavily aloft. Sally</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flashed her green passage light, waiting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anxiously for the reply from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There!" she exclaimed in relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"'They've turned off this section of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Beckerley field.

The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lights of the city diminished and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dimmed; and, at last, Sally relaxed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">leaning more comfortably against him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the close quarters of the cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We're beyond searchlights at last,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she said. "Now they'll have to wait</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">until dawn to pursue us, and by dawn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we might be anywhere in this half of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Asia, for all that they can tell.

When the red sunrise flashed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up on the sea, they were directly over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a narrow promontory that struck south</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the waters. Lister gasped as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw those waters, for surely this was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the most amazing sea ever glimpsed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly eyes, at least since the plesio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saur looked over the oceans of the car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boniferous age hundreds of millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a brilliantly smooth, green sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming at first as motionless as turf.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, as the copter dropped towartl the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach, Lister could distinguish motion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slow heaving of the slime as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast expanse were breathing. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no breakers, for the algae had at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last tamed storm and wind, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas permitted the wind to slip as</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly above them as if the waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been covered with a film of oil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The one thing that sent a tremor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgust through Lister was the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea birds stalking dismally over a crust</seg><seg type="columnLine">of slime that had dried enough to sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port them, gobbling up billions of flies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> SALLY wasted not a glance on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene. "The south cape of Taiwan,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said, as the copter grounded on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slimy beach, "or, as you call it, Formosa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's a boat here-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A boat?

Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone was confident enough, but Lister</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that she was under a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain in this struggle between duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and desire.

It slid easily into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slip; and, without further hesita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, he started the engine, engaged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddles, and was on his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His progress was a queer species of</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotion. The blades threw up vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumps of green slime that fell behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sullen, splashless plumps; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light craft, thrust forward by the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credibly powerful dynoline engines, slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily along the surface of the magot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">infested slime. It was not unduly slow;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he judged that the boat made twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five knots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Formosa was a receding shadow when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he passed the first stalled ship. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a Dutch freighter, and the crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">--or what was left of them, since many</seg><seg type="columnLine">had doubtless been put ashore by cop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter--crowded the rail to watch his pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage. He waved, but there was never</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sign of response.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, he realized the cause of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim silence; his craft bore gold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple stripes--the colors of the Khan</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and the Dutch, with Borneo, Celebes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and New Guinea in the very shadow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vast Asiatic Union, had no love for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Khan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His coil clogged, and he paused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean the slime from the screens. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at this moment that the idea struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; he sat suddenly erect, staring east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward where the China Sea met the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty Pacific. Why did he have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to Hongkong or Haiphong--or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">neutral port, for that matter?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What other possibilities were there?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He glanced at the map of the East In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dies, affixed to the cowl of the motor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was Luzon, of course; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philippines, during their half century</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of independence, had grown far closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Asia, in sympathy, than to the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were the Marianas, where Ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miral Allen had all but annihilated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asiatic fleet, and where surely there</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be an American garrison, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could but reach them. But the Mari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anas lay two thousand miles out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific, close to Guam. He had fuel for</seg><seg type="columnLine">half that distance, but-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> HE SWUNG the craft about and set</seg><seg type="columnLine">it lurching back toward the Dutch</seg><seg type="columnLine">freighter The maintenance crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him sullenly as he approached.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pulled close under the hull and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted, "Any of you understand Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man pushed to the rail. "Yes!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What do you want?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen! I'm American, not Asian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was not in uniform, since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">biological branch did not require it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he displayed his identification tag. with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its red-white-and-blue shield plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a stir. "What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want?" asked the man above him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in friendlier tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just some information. I want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know if there's an American or British</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship stalled between here and Guam.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to buy some fuel. You been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in touch with any?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a long conversation in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Netherlands dialect. At last Lister's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formant spoke again. "De Britisher</seg><seg type="columnLine">Resolute--she stuck--by latitude 21 '20"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and longitude 135'60"."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lister looked at his map, marking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position. It would do; it was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly a thousand miles east of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">present position, and might be a close</seg><seg type="columnLine">gamble with his fuel, but it was worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">the try. If he reached the Britisher</seg><seg type="columnLine">and got fuel, he could then certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">make Guam or the Marianas, and give</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the American army the news that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lichens had blocked the Siberian rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads, thus cutting off the fuel supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Khan's Alaskan Beckerley fields,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that the Khan was frantically lay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a pipe line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between the giving out of the Khan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">coal supply and the arrival of his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil. there might be a brief gap of time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">during which his Beckerley fields would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be dead. If America only knew this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could strike then, the war would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be won. Lister must try to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">information to America in time!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he set the boat lurching away into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the east. Little by little, the Dutch</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship faded toward the horizon, and For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosa was a dark cloud sinking ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower. At last he was alone on a dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">green sea that barely moved, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage left no wake save a slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker green scraping, that slowly closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him. No fin cut the slimy sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and but few birds soared, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their slime-bred prey was too abundant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw them far from land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He set his course carefully on a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle, to conserve his fuel. The mal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">odorous slime sickened him with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">stench. The perpetual lurching of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft added to his nausea. Day faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a starry darkness, and darkness into</seg><seg type="columnLine">day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He made it. At the second mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. with scarcely a pint of dynoline</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining in his tank, the lights of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Resolute flashed out of the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But convincing the captain was. al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most as difficult a job as the passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's deuced irregular!" That official</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted. We're neutrals." But at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, because England had India and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Papua and the Malay States, and hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asia and all its component parts by</seg><seg type="columnLine">tradition and policy, the British cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain acceded to Lister's request, and Lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter set out again with a full tank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had tried to get the captain to</seg><seg type="columnLine">SMOTHERED SEAS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">send a code message by radio to America</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him, but to that the captain had</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved adamant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">EARLY NEXT MORNING, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing back, he spied a plane, wing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing swiftly out of the shadows that still</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouded the west and the distant China</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seas. Soon it arrived, and circled far</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him, then slanted downward in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a _ wide spiral. The double-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden eagle of the Khan's air force</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittered on its wing^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The machine swung close. An arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved vigorously, gesturing in the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection of the west. The pilot was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordering him back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lister stared with narrowed eyes, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted his boat to jog right ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not going to be turned back</seg><seg type="columnLine">so easily as that. All the same, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeling anything but comfortable, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was completely at the mercy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asiatic aviator, should the latter choose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use bullet or bomb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plane circied again. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lister realized with a start of amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that the craft was attempting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">land--to alight on that sticky mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaving slime! It was impossible!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the plane seemed able to achieve</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impossible. Its pontoons skipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly over the treacherous stuff, bound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward him. It was all but down</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely, and then--then the inevitable!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Either the plane dipped or the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaved--Lister could not tell which--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the idling propeller struck a mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of green slime. Very gently, the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted its tail and nosed over, the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">corruption spewing from the spinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">blades. And the pilot--for a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant Lister had a clear view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form that was catapulted through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air--was plunged into the impassive</seg><seg type="columnLine">alga:. All that remained was a quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling depression and the sinking plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he had seen enough. Sally</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amber! It was Sally who struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere in the depths of that nau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seating sea. And he--he was as help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less to aid her as though he were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He spun the wheel; the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounced and jogged toward the spot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As near as he could bring it without dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbing the gradually closing dent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slimy surface of the sea, he halted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the craft. He seized the twenty-foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope fastened to the bow, and tied one</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the-?rope firmly around his arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, fixing his gaze on the spot, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged down into the slime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was like trying to swim in heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil. To move his arms at all required</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great effort, and then he was not sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he was going down, or up, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewise, or was just churning. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff clogged his nose, his eyes, his ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">--even his mouth, when in an unguarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment he opened it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hand struck something solid. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an instant before he realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Sally's ankle. He clutched it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grasp of desperation, and gave a yank</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rope tied to his arm. Pulling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rope was difficult, as he had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one free hand with which to work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once he lost hold of the rope in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slime, and had to start all over again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">groping along it from where it was tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scarcely knew when he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface, so thick was the coating</seg><seg type="columnLine">of muck he carried with him. He thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl across the gunwale,- and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to stop to clear his nose and mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he could even breathe.

She cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in pain as her own finger nails were</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven into the flesh of her palm, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, suddenly, her eyes widened, flut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, and closed, and she sank first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her knees, then in a limp heap at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS DEEP NIGHT when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried her up the side of the U.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">president in person had radioed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Dick Lister pretended to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">elated, to join in the celebration--for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, he had to. But, through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, two fa'-es haunted him: the piquant</seg><seg type="columnLine">oriental features of the girl he loved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the grim, inexorable, duty-mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">features of Captain Cas$. Regardless</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fact that the war was now over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and won, regardless of the part which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lister had played in winning it, Cass</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never rest until he had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">death to the archspy of the late enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so, as soon as he could, Lister</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke away from the jollification, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged his leaden feet toward the ship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital.

Oolanth lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying in the god caves, and all the sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age deities called from the clouds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind could not halt the lowering</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebb of life. And Omar had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oolanth was very rigid. The saliva</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dried on his mouth and it hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. The reddish eyes had set. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dead. Omar arose, pulled the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains across the oval window, and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crystal lantern from its hook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">HE SHUT THE DOOR carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">and locked it. Turning around, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought for Enid, but the room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty, except for the metallic couches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chairs with vitrisheen cushions. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of Earth hung slackly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, above a bottle containing many</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored pebbles native to Venus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The front door was ajar, showing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strip of the foggy out-of-doors.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not soon to forget the look of ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror upon her drawn features as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, leaning on the balustrade, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked back at him. Beyond, a stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rocky soil was exposed to view, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath low-lying clouds, and many di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutive figures were creeping forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making scarcely a sound.

"Don't be a fool!" He wrenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun from her hand and turned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. "Now, do what I tell you. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">mustn't let them know you are afraid!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you understand? You must be con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptuous of them.

To her</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a horrid dream.

It took every bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her will power to stand there. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed up at the overcast skies to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">from fainting at the sickness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnawed at her. Omar knew she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid. Yet he had demanded that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay there. It was cruel of him. yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was determined not to falter. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was back, carrying two slicker gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, with transparent face sheathings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She realized, of a sudden, that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was wet with moisture, that her</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing was damp. It was hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep from falling. Her muscles seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to respond naturally, but she averted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face and struggled into the garment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing the transparent sheathing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and around her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Omar was descending the steps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she found herself walking behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">like, an automaton. Those ferocious lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle faces stood out in the fog like spec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ters in a dream, and then a way was</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Omar said nothing, but strode close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Enid's side, and a little ahead. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad vista was branded indelibly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her consciousness. The fog dipped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eddied. She could sense the closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed bodies of the Eolanians, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to either side, with barbaric weap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ons clenched in their small hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fog had choked the outlines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal building now, and the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked along beside the two terrestrials,</seg><seg type="columnLine">growling to themselves. Abruptly, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">commotion in the rear caused some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foremost to look back. Enid turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared for a moment. She saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of the natives bearing a rigid fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure over their heads. In the gloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">they looked like shadows. It was Ool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anth, stiff and horrid in death, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">they bore aloft. She told Omar what</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They got him then," said Omar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's just as well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The valley floor widened, and ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruptly they were in the Eolanian vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage, with the globular structures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud and rock plastered against precipi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tous obstructions like wasp nests.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smaller natives joined the procession,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing curiously shaped rocks of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors. Enid presumed these smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">green people to be women and children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She saw a creature about the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dog. looking something like a wasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">without wings. It was the only do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mestic animal known to the green men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and like them, it was of alien constitu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, independent of herbivorous plants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When it started toward them, Omar</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked at it, and it fled with a slobber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A MANIACAL FRENZY seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">born within the natives. Their feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamped the rocky floor of the canyon</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a wild cadence. Their pinkish eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">protruded, and the great bloated lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened widely to emit chortling screams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">MOON CRYSTALS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The procession had halted before a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff of black rock, from which yawned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steep triangular opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It's the entrance to the god caves,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Omar. "Don't be frightened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clamor. They're propitiating their</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are motioning for us to stop."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Keep going," he demanded curtly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We're not going to recognize their dei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties." Beyond the three-cornered open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, a faint luminosity was revealed. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went on into the cave, a vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ominous growling rippled over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grouped natives. Some of them leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cavorted, making demoniac and</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscene gestures. When the funeral</seg><seg type="columnLine">cortege for Oolanth passed solemnly</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the terrestrials, those behind made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mad rush for other cave entrances</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would converge on the god caves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How are you feeling, Enid?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I want to cry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold together. It may be worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">than this. When we get to the god</seg><seg type="columnLine">caves, give particular notice to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">domed structures on the cavern floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told you that I showed Oolanth how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cap the fumaroles in the floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">god caves. That is what those struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures will be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rugged walls of the cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed phosphorescently, lighting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limited confines. Behind, the trampling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many feet appraised them of Ool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anth's funeral procession, close upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heels. The corridor was worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare by the passage of many feet. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned twice, then gave into a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular cavern, with a massive altar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">red, glassy rock at the farther side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">above which was a monstrous idol,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carved into the phosphorescent rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The head of the idol was huge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">distorted. It looked something like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous squatted toad. Branching</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the central cavern were many</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings and runways, from which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives streamed, gesticulating and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Omar pointed to the low heaps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">domed stone, scarcely a foot high, plas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered over with thick cement. Enid</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled over one of them. The rum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling of many hoarse voices filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All around them were grimacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces. The little green men shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spat at the terrestrials, brandishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">their weapons. Only the way before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was left open, and that led up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the altar composed of a substance like</seg><seg type="columnLine">red glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they were carried past this also</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the surge of natives behind them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A second doorway yawned in the cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the idol. They were pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the opening. Omar frowned. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never been in this inner cavern.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enid was sobbing, despite her efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to quiet her emotions, and she clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">unashamedly to his arm. A glitter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silvery metal in one wall captured his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> HE STARED, although he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to stop and examine the formation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was almost solid with luxobe, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon crystals of Venus. A massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorite of the substance must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been imbedded here. Perhaps it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the core of the satellite that had crum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled and fallen from its orbit. So it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was here that the natives got their moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystals. He had supposed that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found them on the rocky surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad lands somewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly Omar knew that the Eolani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ans never intended that they return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell of this large deposit of moon crys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tals. He gripped at the needle-beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">gat hanging in its holster. The shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the green men reverberated deafen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly. Now a second and even larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern loomed ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They strode down into the bowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped cavity side by side, followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thronged green natives of Venus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Omar could have shouted aloud for</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy.

The fuma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roles had evidently broken loose in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern also, for he saw signs of native</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, capping the gaseous outlets with</seg><seg type="columnLine">concrete domes. He looked farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hung around against the walls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many whitened skeletons, one of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was large and unlike the others. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">one other Earth man had got here. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had died. It was a chamber of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oolanth's body was placed, face up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center. A group of natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a ring and danced about him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making superstitious gestures and bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing in strident tones. Then all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them knelt, and one arose over him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lifted his head high to scream a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous challenge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oolanth's soul had gone to the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Enid could scarcely believe her senses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Omar had arisen to face the little green</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and he too lifted his face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly screamed aloud in an answer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing challenge that rung to the phophor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escent roof and rebounded again with</seg><seg type="columnLine">eerie echoings. Omar Klegg knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the affront made by the little green man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been aimed at the terrestrials. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">native had proclaimed that the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings were not gods, and Omar had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled the defiant words back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's face as a lie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hemispherical sea of faces hemmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in. The green man came forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">threateningly, preparing to throw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp stone fragment, equipped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">filed spikes. Omar leveled the needle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam gat. When the Eolanian sprang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blue beam of intense light cut his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body in half. Omar turned as his ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versary sank to the floor, and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed a warning in the native</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face was almost bestial. Enid</seg><seg type="columnLine">cringed. It was hard to believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Omar was a terrestrial, and her man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She looked about into the ring of green-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ish faces, and knew suddenly that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures were as a pack of hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolves, without mercy. Another green</seg><seg type="columnLine">man leaped over the body of Oolanth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again the needle beam spat its ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Simultaneously the entire horde be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan edging in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be ready to run for it!" shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Omar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THEN he turned and shot the blu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish needle beam down along the cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. The slender ray bored into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome shape plastered into the rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. For a moment it ate into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stonework. Then something erupted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A shrill whistle of escaping vapor fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed a spray of rock upward. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the astonished natives could attack, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth from the deep interior of Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">spat up, and the expanding gas cre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated a column of ice that reared up like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cold flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back!" cried Omar, grasping Enid</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the arm. "It's carbon dioxide--pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">carbon dioxide. And it's been under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Enid seemed paralyzed. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen ice formed by the release of car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bon dioxide under pressure in liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen experiments. Heat was ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed from the air, and the pure oxy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gen became a cold liquid. She saw it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an icy, silvery stream, trickling away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the mounting column of ice to</seg><seg type="columnLine">run across the face of the dead Oolanth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blue disintegrator beam traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther along the cavern floor, cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy furrows to other mouths of ce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, which shrieked with escaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">gases and spouted up other tongues of</seg><seg type="columnLine">frigid ice. The natives were bent over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhing and screaming. The carbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">dioxide was a poison that acted rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them.

His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked like marionettes on a string from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the forty-foot tank with the profusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of apparatus in back of it to the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, gray door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fourth man was the most placid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them all.

But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were mistaken. The electrocution cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber was only a few steps from "Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demned Row"; the current should al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready have surged through the body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man whose life had been declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">forfeit by the State.

Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the technique, as a matter of fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his. Stubbs was not good at that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great tank was forty feet long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet wide, and five deep. It was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">filled almost to the top with a clear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lusterless jelly. Huge electrodes sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep into the thin, quivering stuff at</seg><seg type="columnLine">either end, and were connected by cables</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an instrument board on the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken pressed a button. A section of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass top slid smoothly underneath,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the tank exposed just wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to admit a human body. Above</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, suspended from a miniature crane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a cradle of extremely thin, longi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudinally stretched wires. At a gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Ken, the guards lifted the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobile body of the condemned man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposited it carefully into the cradle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he knifed a switch. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whir, and the cradle, with its strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">burden, dipped slowly from unwinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains into the transparent substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the tank. Down, down, ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, while the men in the room stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fixed, unwilling fascination. Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bascom forgot his pose of smooth bore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom, leaned eagerly forward. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards gaped blankly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken was tremendously cool now; all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his faculties concentrated on the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand. The jelly closed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiver over the descending form.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within its clear depths the cradled body</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed like a prehistoric monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in a huge globule of ancient am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a tiny bump. The cradle</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to rest on the floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank, close to the positive electrode.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ken pressed another button. The wires</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened out underneath the rigid body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the apparatus rose to its former</seg><seg type="columnLine">position again. The glass section slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly into place. The tiny click,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it closed, was loud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warden shivered, looked around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professional routine jerked him out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his haze. It would never do for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards to witness what was going on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They might talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O. K., you two," he said harshly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get back to your duties." The men</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered something, went out hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISOTOPE MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly as if they were glad to be done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even the tainted air of the prison cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridors outside seemed sweet after what</seg><seg type="columnLine">little they had seen in the converted</seg><seg type="columnLine">workshop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stubbs moved quickly to the instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment panel. For an instant his long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bony fingers clung with fierce grip to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bakelite handle of the master switch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes burned through the transpar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ency of the tank, fixed with a fanatical</seg><seg type="columnLine">light on the quiescent body within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The future of the world rested on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tug of his hand. If the experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment proved a success, his name would</seg><seg type="columnLine">go rocketing down the centuries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Darwin, Newton, Einstein, Galileo</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be pale, glimmering phantoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared to him. Yet he hesitated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Things his young assistant, Ken Craig,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said, flashed through his mind. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster had pleaded with him not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go through with this final test. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been damned persistent about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He, Malcolm Stubbs, had finally for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidden further discussion. The young</seg><seg type="columnLine">whippersnapper, with his silly talk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">outraged nature, of incalculable results.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What of them? Science was its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">justification. Nothing else mattered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suppose what Craig had said were true?</seg><seg type="columnLine">For an infinitesimal second a vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt disturbed his fanatic unity of pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose--then he was himself again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch knifed down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A TREMENDOUS current surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the electrodes. The jelly, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their base, stirred uneasily, blurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly with tiny bubbles. The seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly dead figure of Horty hazed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great experiment had begun!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The experiment that would change the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the world, that would bring to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass disruptions and transformations</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond anything even Ken, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguest and most inchoate fears, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever dreamed possible.

The experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was proceeding according to schedule.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The body of the immersed criminal</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have widened out.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could understand exactly how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warden felt.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not like any display of human emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion during the course of an experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.

His eyes were bulg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the tank. The jelly was quiver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with strange forces. Invisible</seg><seg type="columnLine">strains emanated from the positive elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trode, heaved the transparent substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in long, internally contained billows</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the length of the tank. The proc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ess was accelerating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Horty was no longer a solid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">compact body. He had lost shape and</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance. He was stretching out along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane of vibration in a tenuous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghostlike flow; he was blurred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">misty and unrecognizable; he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">parallelepiped of former length and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickness, but already he was three feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide and expanding visibly. Then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parker uttered a choked cry, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The misty, tenuous form seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">divide along the longitudinal axis of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, something like a cell reproducing</seg><seg type="columnLine">by binary fission. To the extreme right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left, dense, formless masses made</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark blotches within the jelly; in be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween, shading into the two heavier sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, was a thinner, more rarefied sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, through whose interstices the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague, adumbrating outlines of the tank</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind were dimly visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parker's face was gray and twitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Stark horror swept over him in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanketing cloud. He could stand it no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer, this thing that he was witness-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. With a shrill cry he wheeled, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindly toward the steel door, fumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with palsied fingers at the bolts, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was out. For the first time in his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warden had known fear; for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time in his life he had violated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple terms of his duty. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">quitted the side of a condemned crim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inal, had abandoned him to the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men not connected with the prison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until he reached the pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacy of his own office, and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling into a chair that he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that. But Horty was no longer alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he argued with himself. It was incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceivable, ghastly, what he had just seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not for a million dollars would he ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture back into that place of horror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let those inhuman scientists do what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they wished, as long as he did not see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> BACK in the converted laboratory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs was faintly amused. A sardonic</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile twisted his thin lips. "We're bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter off without him," he remarked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Bascom. "You don't feel the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">way about an epochal experiment in sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The prison doctor hastily stuffed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket the large handkerchief with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had been mopping his too-pink</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no, of course not," he replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily. ''I wouldn't miss this for</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds." Yet Ken was sure that only</seg><seg type="columnLine">professional pride kept him from fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing in the footsteps of the warden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken forced his eyes away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank. Everything was proceeding ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to schedule. There was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing else to be done now but wait.

His short, pudgy arm extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the tank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stubbs frowned. What did Craig</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean by his fool suggestion? He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he, Stubbs, hated explanations, es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecially to a layman.

Bah,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISOTOPE MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">worse than a layman!

So he un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bended slightly, and condescended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A good many years ago," he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather ungraciously, "I had a brother.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the War came, he was idiot</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to leave my laboratory, to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into the trenches. When it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over, he came back. But the War</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done things to him. Your fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">medico diagnosed it as shellshock. That,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt, was the inducing mechanism,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the result was definitely what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens in a very inconsiderable number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My brother was no longer himself;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was two other and distinct personal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ities.

The two states were sepa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate and s liar ply defined. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternate suddenly from one to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, and in each State he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly unaware of his other incarna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, so to speak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Bascom nodded his head vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously. He was interested now. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something in his own field. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear case of dissociation of personal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity," he remarked. "Or what is some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times called dual personality.

He must say something,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything, to rid him of that last glimpse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It struck me suddenly," Stubbs went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on incisively, "that in the isotopic ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments lay, possibly, the answer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem of my brother, of all similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases of dissociation of personality;</seg><seg type="columnLine">even, perhaps to the unconscious that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the psychoanalysts talk about so glibly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see how," Bascom said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly bewildered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is really quite simple," the scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist explained patiently. "The human</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, protoplasm, bone structure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, is composed chiefly of six elements.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulphur, and calcium, with a scattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of others. Every one of these has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissociated into its isotopes. They ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ist, as far as we know, in indisseverable</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixture. But suppose that isn't so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suppose that some internal mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">exists in the human body, in each cell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which under certain rare conditions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clicks, and dissociates the isotopes. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">already know much about the genes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">inheritance within the cell nucleus. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that there are present, side by</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, genes of opposing inherited char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acters. The stronger, or dominant gene</seg><seg type="columnLine">will mask the recessive characters, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they did not exist. Yet, in the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">generation, perhaps, the recessive gene,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by proper association, may in turn mask</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dominant characteristic."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Bascom was listening intently</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Ken Craig had heard this ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">position before. As a matter of fact, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was he who had suggested the analogy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Stubbs, had finally put him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right trail. Naturally it was too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an assistant to expect credit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why then, I thought," Stubbs went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AST--3</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISOTOPE MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "might not the isotopes of the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments in the human body act the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">way? Those present in the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantity would be dominant, the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">recessive. Less than one per cent are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the isotopes; the other ninety-nine per</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent what we had heretofore consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the entire element. Suppose, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the case of recessive genes, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing happens, and the minority isotopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly mask the dominant norm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What would you have?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor's eyes bulged. "Why, 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I'd say you'd have a different per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonality. The other part of what we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">called dual personalities."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," Stubbs declared trium-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a while there was silence. Bas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">com dared not look at the tank. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid. It was hard to digest what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had just heard. Then, diffidently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he ventured: "The theory sounds im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peccable. But-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How put it into practice?" Stubbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished for him. "Easiest thing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. The technique for separating</seg><seg type="columnLine">isotopes is pretty well established by</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. I've improved on it immensely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've done more than merely shift iso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">topes within the body. I'm able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate them entirely, make two sepa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate human bodies, two separate entities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where one existed before, each com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed of a unit set of isotopes. I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">done what nature has merely fumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at doing. I've taken the two personal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ities and clothed them in visible form</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time in the history of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> BASCOM GASPED. So that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was taking place within the tank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shrank away from its implications,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as Ken had done a while before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Stubbs thought his gasp was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of awe for his genius.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In that tank," pursued the scientist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"is a nutrient gelatin, properly treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry an electric current. The in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">AST-4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jection I gave Horty contained, beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">a powerful narcotic, a saline solution</seg><seg type="columnLine">to promote conductivity within his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am passing a current of extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">high amperage and low voltage through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gelatin. The body dissociates into</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions, and, following the laws of elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolytic separation, these ions migrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the gelatin very slowly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the positive to the negative electrode.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the speed of migration is not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same for the various isotopes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same element. The lighter isotope ions</seg><seg type="columnLine">move faster than the heavier ones. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lighter ones are invariably those ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments which make up ninety-nine per</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent of the whole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In other words, the heavy, dominant</seg><seg type="columnLine">personality will reach the negative elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trode first; the lighter, recessive per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonality will lag behind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But they'll both be mere dead ag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gregations of atoms," Bascom protested.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You've murdered a man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stubbs smiled bleakly. His lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted, as if to speak, when Ken, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the controls of the tank, absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the drama within, shouted excitedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think we've reached peak load,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stubbs rushed to the side of the tank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bascom followed with lagging feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oddly reluctant. The larger, heavy cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clustered now close to the base of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the negative electrode. Outlines were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, all trace that once it had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">human body. A mere mist trailed back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward toward the positive electrode,</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded almost to nothingness. Then it</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickened gradually until, some five feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, it became a small, thin cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">migrating ions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Test it with the mass spectograph,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs ordered, eyes glinting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange lights. But Ken was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the instrument. Two long tubes ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended into the tank, three inches apart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and connected outside with the spectro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph. Their ends protruded exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the point at which the cloud of ions</seg><seg type="columnLine">was vaguest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken opened a valve. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissing sound as a tiny amount of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gelatin sucked along the two tubes into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chamber of the instrument. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">then adjusted sights, watched intently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he lifted his head, it was hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to keep his voice matter-of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, coldly scientific.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The division is complete," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced. "All the light ions are in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right-hand sample, the heavier ones are</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly to the left."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stubbs raced swiftly to the master</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch, opened the interlocking knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges. The current shut off; the gela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinous substance within the tank heaved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddered, and came to a deathly quies-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cence. The two blobs of matter hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless in its depths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientist returned to a huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cameralike affair that faced the tank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He swung it slowly until its great lens</seg><seg type="columnLine">was focused sharply on the larger blob</seg><seg type="columnLine">of matter. He pressed a button. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet glow sprang out in a cylinder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance to bathe the formless mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions and their supporting medium with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its eerie light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The experiment is through, fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished." He turned to Bascom exult-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antly. "We've done it before with</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals; now it has been successful</seg><seg type="columnLine">with human beings.

There will be formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the gelatin an exact replica of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once been James Horty. Watch!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bascom watched, and felt the hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">bristle on his neck, all over his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly, but surely, the vague, amor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phous mass was taking shape and form.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the violet light continued to glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily and strongly within the tank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cloud lengthened, shifted with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ternal movement, showed strange, wa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vering outlines.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no way of telling. The animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">we worked with could give us no an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swers.

The other Horty is yours--to live,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do with as you please." One finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was close to a signal button. "If that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not satisfactory, I'll have to call the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long moment Stubbs stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock-still, clenching and unclenching his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. The veins on his forehead</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelled dangerously; his eye swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">from defiant assistant to Bascom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again. Ken had not moved from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the controls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well then," he acquiesced sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> denly. "Craig, help me lift Mr. Horty</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the tank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken's withheld breath exploded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief. That was better. He was sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs would soon realize the justice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his argument, agree with him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang to the mechanism that actuated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crane at the negative electrode. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire cradle dipped swiftly into the gela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin, closed beneath the immobile figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lifted it, dripping blobs of jelly, out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The agitation of the jelly substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered the small cloud that had hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended in colloidal solution, roiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ions into irreplacable confusion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other Horty was no more, was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead scientifically as well as legally. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter of the law had been observed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horty had died, under the auspices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the State, yet Horty still lived. A par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">adox which occupied some space in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison doctor's thoughts, but none at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in Ken's. He was a scientist, not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Together, the two scientists heaved at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body, carried it to a specially pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pared table. Light-radiant machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsed into action. Healing, life-giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiations glowed over the rigid limbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tension in the room reached in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">supportable heights. The three men</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched eagerly, waiting. Would the</seg><seg type="columnLine">isotopic Horty come to life, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller, less highly organized animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done? If so, what would he be</seg><seg type="columnLine">like? Questions that could only be an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered by the thing that still rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolidly on the table. In the minds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least two of the three the sharp dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pute of a minute before was forgotten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sealed book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seconds passed, grew into minutes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minutes ticked off interminably.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And still Horty did not move, did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe. Strange emotions stirred in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ken. As a scientist he felt sickening</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair at the apparent failure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment. As a man, a human being,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was secretly glad. There were im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISOTOPE MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plications in its success that he feared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. His gaze clung to the extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. It was Horty in every lineament</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's eyelids fluttered suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the beating light; his limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">twitched ; the warm color of life infused</seg><seg type="columnLine">his limbs. A simultaneous exclamation</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke from the three men. They re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained rooted to the ground, unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move. It was a resurrection of the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than dead!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jim Horty yawned, opened his eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked bewilderedly about him. Slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he raised himself to a sitting position</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the table. He blinked in the dazzle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the lamps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken sprang forward, turned them off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're all right now, Horty," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothed. "Take it easy. Here are your</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE MAN looked at him, then at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others with a puzzled, abstracted air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he looked down at his ill-fitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripes. He made a gesture of distaste,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he put them 011 obediently. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he swung to the floor. A shudder rip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled over him. He passed his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his eyes, as if trying to obliterate</seg><seg type="columnLine">an awful vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know," he said slowly, and Ken</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted with thumping heart that, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the voice of Horty, yet the dic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, the modulations, had changed, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come softer, more precise, "I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream, and it was a terrible one. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have fallen asleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked again at his prison clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Dr. Bascom. Then he smiled wryly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow his brutish features were suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused with new light. "I'm to be exe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuted, am I not? Well, I'm ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The sentence was fair and just. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a murderer. Funny though," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again that puzzled look crept into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, "I must have been crazy, doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things I did. Robbery! Murder!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, I--I wouldn't hurt a fly! O. K.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Di. Bascom. Let's get over with it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The prison doctor's eyes were liter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally popping out of his head. His mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled incoherently. His pudgy fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger trembled toward the tank. "You--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you were-" But the doctor couldn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">go on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the doctor is trying to say,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ken broke in sharply, "is that you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been pardoned. We just received word</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the governor. You're a free man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reintegrated man stared at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulously. Then, surprisingly, tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled down cheeks that had never felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">their channeled coursing before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tliank God!" he murmured reverently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is beyond my deserts. My crimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were many and horrible, and should</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have been expiated. But' now-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">His shoulders squared. Already the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy, cunning set of his features was</seg><seg type="columnLine">subtly changing, shifting with inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformation. "New life awaits me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feel things stirring here--inside." His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand went to his breast. "I want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn, to do things to help my fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, to keep them from the paths that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I once trod."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken thrilled with glad relief. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle had happened. This strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">new personality, this being who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloughed less than a hundredth of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">former being, was refined of all dross</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the isotope reintegration. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no question about it. Horty's tones rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sincerity, with conviction. Ken's</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance shifted to the murky diffusion in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tank, and shivered suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What unutterable evil must have in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hered in that minute residue, to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">masked this greater personality, to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Horty what he bad been--a vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminal without a single redeeming hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man quality! Stubbs must see now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was right, had been terribly right all</seg><seg type="columnLine">along. Never again would he attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to associate that dissociated, discarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">personality!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the scientist was staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">with devouring eyes at this being who</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was incredibly his own creation. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt drunk with godlike powers. Fame,</seg><seg type="columnLine">power illimitable, beckoned dizzily. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">his long, bony hands rested the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world. As in a glass, darkly, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the marvelous possibilities ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A race of beings, dissociated into pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">states, no longer inhibited by clinging,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragging personalities! What might</seg><seg type="columnLine">they not achieve!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ken had sensed the elements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger, was even now revolving in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind the means of eliminating them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not so Stubbs. His single-track brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">rejected all compromise contemptuously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His fanatical regard for science, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain still inchoate thoughts, permit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted no social elements, no humanitarian</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspects to interfere with the course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure experiment. Craig and Bascom</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stopped him this once. A grim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasant smile played over his angular</seg><seg type="columnLine">features. Next time-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THEY TOOK Jim Horty back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to the Stubbs laboratories on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outskirts of the metropolis. They hus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled him out secretly, wrapped in a muf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling overcoat, and whizzed him in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade-drawn sedan down congested</seg><seg type="columnLine">arteries of traffic. Dr. Bascom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warden Parker had insisted on that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was to be no publicity until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could communicate with the governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clear themselves of official respon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility in this very complex and unpre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cedented situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet they had not escaped unobserved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An enterprising reporter, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelled a story in the abrupt refusal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit outside witnesses to the execu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the notorious Jim Horty, lurked</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the prison walls, waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to break. He saw the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate swing open, the long, black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrouded car slide through. Suspicious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert, he followed his hunch, kicked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">starter of his ancient car into life, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ratded after it in close pursuit. Traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">being what it was, he was able to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speeding car in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When it turned into the side road</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading to Malcolm Stubbs' heavily en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dowed laboratories he was sure he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no mistake; when, his. car half</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden by masking shade trees, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs and his assistant, Ken Craig,</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerge, and solicitously help down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure swathed in a huge coat, his ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement grew. When, just as the trio</seg><seg type="columnLine">crunched up the gravel walk, the coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">collar fell away momentarily to reveal</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only too well-known features of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminal, the news hawk knew he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whale of a story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One hour later, to the dot, wild head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines flooded the city streets.

The story had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a vengeance!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before all that happened, another</seg><seg type="columnLine">drama, more personal in its nature, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">less world-shaking in its implications,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taking place within the close con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fines of the Stubbs laboratories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three men had hurried into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living quarters. Horty sagged into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, still physically unstrung from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific transformation he had under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, still mentally fumbling to express</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner changes that he felt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken shrugged his coat off eagerly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was brimming over with plans, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">new experiments which opened before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in never-ending vistas at the trium-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phantly successful conclusion of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">crucial test. He wanted to get into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISOTOPE MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory at once, to suggest certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">problems to Stubbs. He had forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely the late unpleasantness in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">converted workshop of the prison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Stubbs had not. He had sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffly in the car while Ken drove,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped in impenetrable silence, nurs-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his anger, maturing certain plans of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You had better put your coat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, Craig." His voice was tinged</seg><seg type="columnLine">venom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken stopped short.

"Are we going out?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are going out," Stubbs an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered vindictively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean, Mr. Craig," Stubbs retorted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you are discharged, fired, no longer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my employ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> KEN braced himself. "I see," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said quietly. "You want your assistant</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a 'yes-man.' You want no brake</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your inordinate ambitions. You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great scientist, Mr. Stubbs, but you</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't the true scientific spirit. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved you a little while ago from an</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment that might have ended dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">astrously, not only for us, but for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">human race. You are now venting your</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite on me for that; you are afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I might try to prevent you again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are right. I would. I'm warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">you again. Think long and hard be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore you even repeat what we have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far. Make sure there are no secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">defects; wait at least a year for them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to appear. That is the way of science;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is what distinguishes research from</seg><seg type="columnLine">charlatanry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get out!" Stubbs growled, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick with passion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-by," Ken answered evenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And remember what I said."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly he turned toward the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a wrench, this being cast off at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment of fruition. He knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs wanted to hog all the limelight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for himself. That did not matter. Ken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">preferred to remain in the background,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though he had contributed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">this particular bit of work more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs was willing to admit. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">epochal experiment was only begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horty, the pure isotopic man, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not merely a scientific problem; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a human, a social problem. Stubbs was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the man to cope with that side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation properly. Ken felt a sink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sensation. What did Stubbs intend</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing next?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horty stared bewilderedly from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other during the altercation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somehow his new personality instinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively trusted Ken Craig, and just as in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively shrank from the cold angu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larities of Stubbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Craig!" he called suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken stopped, turned, looked at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horty blushed--a novel sensation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His heavy features worked with strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotion. "I--I would like to go with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," he stammered diffidently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No you don't," Stubbs snarled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You stay here with me, as long as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want you.

"I thought the gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor had pardoned me, that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">free."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Free!" the scientist echoed sardoni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally, and laughed. It was not a pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh. "You're dead, Horty, do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand? The legal part of you is</seg><seg type="columnLine">back there in prison, scattered into in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguishable atoms. You're just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">resurrected chattel, a mere part of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, an experimental creature."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A frightened look crept into Horty's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. "Is that true, what he's saying?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he appealed to Ken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young scientist controlled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seething anger with an effort.

He dismissed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">nonsense the mystical terms with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychology was all too often impenetra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bly inwrapped.

"That doesn't bother</seg><seg type="columnLine">me one bit. Bill," he said earnestly.

But the highly placed offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cials did not know that, and Stubbs was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now a figure of international impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Furthermore, anything that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take these men off relief was eagerly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be grasped. Taxes were mounting</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily, and certain powerful business</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were complaining. So consent was</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted, all in the name of science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such was the power of propaganda</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the idea was at once universally</seg><seg type="columnLine">acclaimed. No one raised his voice in</seg><seg type="columnLine">objection; no one, that is, except the</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected hundred and their families. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">their protests were swept aside as im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pertinent and showing a dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendency toward radicalism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do these ignorant protestors</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the march of scientific progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect?" one influential newspaper edi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torialized indignantly.

Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test, forsooth! If anything proved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity of their submission to Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs' process, it is the very fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they do object."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken Craig and Bill Maynard ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected, too. But no one listened. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">editor who took the matter up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs was told that Craig was a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gruntled employee whom he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">compelled to discharge for utter incom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petency and worse, and thereafter Ken</seg><seg type="columnLine">was persona non grata in all the forums</seg><seg type="columnLine">where public opinion is plastically</seg><seg type="columnLine">molded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, with a fanfare of trumpets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">editorial handsprings, the great experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment went through. A huge tract of</seg><seg type="columnLine">land was set aside for experimental pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses. High, barbed fences surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hastily erected buildings; armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards patrolled the grounds day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. The disconsolate men were torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their weeping families and hustled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the inclosure. A series of tanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been set up, with a multiplication</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mass spectrographs, reintegrators,</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical generators, healing rays, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other essential equipment. Stubbs was</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparing for large-scale production.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Funds were unlimited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VI.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THEN CAME the fateful day. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">unemployed were narcotized in batches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust into the tanks of gelatin. Duly</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were ionized, dissociated, reinte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grated. This time there was no Ken</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craig to croak warnings. Furthermore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain military gentleman had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendously interested in the proceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. Not, you understand, in their sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">entific aspects, and certainly not in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible raising of the ethical stadards</seg><seg type="columnLine">or mental ability of the Isotope Men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the physical duplication, or tripli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation even, of available cannon fodder</seg><seg type="columnLine">that caught his undivided attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why, he argued, should this country</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for the slow, natural processes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">birth and growth? Here, at one swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke, it was possible to double the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the nation. His mind dazzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the glittering vistas it opened, of tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous armies called literally into ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istence with the aid of a scientific wand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw himself in the role of a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alexander, a new Ghengis Khan. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">economic and social dislocations to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">country already staggering under a peak</seg><seg type="columnLine">load of unemployment did not enter his</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple calculations. He was a soldier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a machine geared to one task only--</seg><seg type="columnLine">war! So Stubbs had the necessary back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISOTOPE MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for what he had secretly intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">all along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly, the reintegrators were</seg><seg type="columnLine">focused on all the inchoate masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">isotope atoms as they moved with vary-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing degrees of speed through the spe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially treated gelatin. In five of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred cases, three personalities had</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissociated themselves under the selec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive thrust of the tremendous current.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dominant isotopes, the ninety-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine-per-cent men, were easily handled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The technique had already been mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, thanks to Ken's unheralded, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acknowledged researches. The one-per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centers, or fractions thereof in the case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the triple dissociations, required more</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful consideration. Here, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ken had worked out the theoretic an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swers for Stubbs, more than once the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great scientist fumbled, and wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely that Craig was back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very carefully and very slowly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">requisite elements were injected into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">misty, ghostlike wraiths of the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed men--in tiny dosages, in fixed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unalterable proportions. And all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the reintegrators kept up their</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady patterned beat of rays, molding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new material into the interstices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sketchy personalities, filling them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a delicate process, and Stubbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not possess his former assistant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sureness of touch. As a result there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were many casualties, personalities that</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished again into irretrievable con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glomerations of atoms. And there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">others that did not vanish, that actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to life. These, because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungling technique, were such mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strosities, such frightening apparitions</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of a mythical, wonder-working past,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Stubbs, secretly and in scared haste,</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed them with powerful corrosives</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they lay quiescent, immobile, within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the transparencies of the gelatin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For minutes after, he sat gasping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddering in his chair.

He even</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed sardonically at himself. He,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great Malcolm Stubbs, pausing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his triumphant career because of silly</seg><seg type="columnLine">warnings. The experiment was suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful. There was no doubt about that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of the dominant isotopes, every one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hundred was even now stirring back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to life under the ministrations of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creet assistants, chosen more for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">manual dexterity and humble fidelity</seg><seg type="columnLine">than for brilliant scientific achievement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And of the recessive personalities, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty-odd were salvaged, expanding with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warm hues of life under the heal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rays.

Humanity transfigured, rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon above the poor planet to which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been chained, achieving the planets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nay, the stars themselves!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Certain small symptoms were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted in the accelerating rush of events.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Symptoms, however, that held in them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves the seeds of destruction. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the present the future was a shim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mering mirage. Malcolm Stubbs was</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical dictator of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was no fool. Already he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted that these creations of his were</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstripping him in his own special</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. In short order his carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded secret process would be dupli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated, improved on, and he. the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">begetter and initiator--you see, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this time forgotten that Kenneth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craig had ever existed--would be shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered aside just as the leaders in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields had been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For in this new world of Isotope Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no room for pity, for com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passion, for the nice amenities of life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were supermen, hard, efficient,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruthless--with the possible exception of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horty. No inhibitions held them back;</seg><seg type="columnLine">no recessive isotope personalities acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISOTOPE MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as secret brakes. They were single-pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed, driving, subject to no doubts or</seg><seg type="columnLine">indecisions. Sometimes they pushed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">extravagant lengths on small matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">that normal people would not have both-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered with. The seeds of future diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culties were there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor were they exactly happy. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were times when almost unbearable</seg><seg type="columnLine">aches stirred through them, when every</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom, it seemed, yearned vaguely for</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that was missing, for some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing they could not find. These mani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">festations, however, were rare in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning; and of short duration. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spasms came and passed almost imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, one memorable day, to the hosan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nas of an excited world, Malcolm</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs, stiff and immobile under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narcotic, was carefully lowered into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own dissociation bath, and two new</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malcolm Stubbs appeared in due course</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sight of all and sundry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> WE HAVE NOT as yet discoursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the recessive isotopes, the one-per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centers who were fed and nurtured un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til they became seemingly whole human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings. There had been good and suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient reason for this. In the first place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it took time and considerable effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring them to that state. In the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, it had been deemed wise to secrete</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the general view, even from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight and knowledge of their fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">isotopes, their complementary personal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ities, so to speak. For they had proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat of a shock to Stubbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In every limb, in every feature, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every bodily mark and pattern, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were twins with their counterparts. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">much so that it was positively frighten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, so much so that at first there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">several confused shufflings in which re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessives were sent out into the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dominants placed in camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The military gentleman had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of this second batch. It would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not do to have identical twins, between</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom it was impossible to differentiate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking and living in the same paths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence. The possibilities for confu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, for worse, were obvious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be somewhat of a shock for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man to see his mirror image approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him in the street; family life would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be subjected to certain alarming or</seg><seg type="columnLine">ludicrous situations, and in industry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">politics, anything might happen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the recessives were spirited away</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a huge concentration camp in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the Great Smoky National</seg><seg type="columnLine">Park. By the end of six months there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a hundred thousand of them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">military gentleman was in ecstasies. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained them and drilled them daily in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of modern arms, in the minutiae</seg><seg type="columnLine">of warfare. Soon, he figured, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have enough to start on his career of</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquest. Nothing less than the domi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation of the world floated before his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision. And that, mind you, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapping the regular man-strength of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, without dislocating in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest the normal processes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These recessives, too, had undergone</seg><seg type="columnLine">testings. Outwardly they were counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of their fellows. Inwardly, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, there was considerable difference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For one thing, they were not supermen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their abilities did not run to the arts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sciences, to all the differentiating</seg><seg type="columnLine">talents that make of the human race an</seg><seg type="columnLine">endless and infinite variety. Rather,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a certain essential sameness</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them all, a certain monotony that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to indicate a definite bedrock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This bothered Stubbs vaguely at first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something terrifying in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive alikeness. They did what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were told, obediently, yet sullenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their intellects seemed subordinated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emotions, to deep-seated instincts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, of course, did not bother the mili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary gentleman in the slightest. As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of fact it was cause for further</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">congratulations. Ideal soldiers, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">chortled, good cannon fodder!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, underneath, flashing into mani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">festation like fireflies on a moonless</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, and as suddenly extinguishing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were certain traits which escaped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">testing psychologists. A certain secre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiveness, a certain furtive cunning, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain electrical sparkling between re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessive and recessive, as if they were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystically united in a common bond of</seg><seg type="columnLine">racial integrity. But their drilling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">obedient marching went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The new Stubbs regained easily his</seg><seg type="columnLine">former leadership. His bleak fanaticism</seg><seg type="columnLine">intensified; all hesitancies, all former</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubts, were gone. He became Dicta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor of the Americas. He took over, bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">and baggage, the secret plans of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">military gentleman for his own use,</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to the latter's discomfiture. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">inward raging and outer submission,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that individual took subordinate com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once, and once only, did the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs feel at a loss. That was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning, when the recessive Stubbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">was brought before him. He had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient intellectual curiosity to wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see his counterpart, and he had felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">an understandable aversion to a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him being herded to the concentration</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that one experience was enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every atom in his being flamed out to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward that other Stubbs. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">longing of a lover for his mate, a mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion times intensified, a wrenching, sick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening force that left him weak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling and afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had Stubbs been a student of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">classics, as was Craig, he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known what had happened, would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized immediately to what dreadful</seg><seg type="columnLine">consequences his violent disruption of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human complex into its pure iso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">topes was inevitably tending. Plato, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Symposium, expressed the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">in words and phrases that were a re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">markable prophecy of what Stubbs had</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually achieved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the eyes of the recessive Stubbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flame also leaped; but it was not of</seg><seg type="columnLine">longing. It was the flame of unquench-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able hatred for this physical counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">part. Then, almost at once, it died into</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stubbs shivered. "Take him away,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cried to his assistants. "Send him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the camp. I don't ever want to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him again." Submissively, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a backward glance, the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs shuffled out of the room, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lost to his sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DURING this six months of world</seg><seg type="columnLine">turmoil and tremendous, seething</seg><seg type="columnLine">events. Ken Craig and Bill Maynard re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained stubbornly aloof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the thousands rushed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissociation tanks, they stuck to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory, normal, whole human be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. In the new regime of supermen</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were anonymous individuals, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conspicuous for learning, for dazzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">new discoveries. Yet they were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The feeling had grown on them</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the great change that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something radically and terribly wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it all. They could not put exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers on it, but every time they en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered an isotope man the feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck them with redoubled force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As if." Ken remarked, "there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a missing element. As if any moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole precariously balanced struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture would tumble into disintegration</seg><seg type="columnLine">before our very eyes."	-v</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the months passed and nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. More and more went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the baths. There was hardly a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominence, of recognized ability and</seg><seg type="columnLine">talent, in the United States, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been dissociated into his various</seg><seg type="columnLine">personalities. Only the dull average,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great mass of ordinarily anonymous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AST-4</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISOTOPE MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">65</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Brother, your sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinate intends to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill me, the integral</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of yourself. Or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der him to stop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">common hordes might have their turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile Ken worked desperately</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his laboratory, doing secret things</seg><seg type="columnLine">with mice and guinea pigs and poor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared rabbits. And always, at crucial</seg><seg type="columnLine">points in the experiments, he came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a dead wall, beyond which there</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed no further progress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Sometimes," he told Bill desperately,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I feel as if I too should dissociate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps my dominant phase might be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">people, were still what they had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, a natural mixture of isotopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not that they wished for that un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">desirable state. They clamored for dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sociation ; they besieged Stubbs with</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager cries. It was physically impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible as yet to handle millions. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who gave evidence of superman possibil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ities came first. Later, years later, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">AST--5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">able to solve the problems that puzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">me now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill looked at hhn humorously. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be jumping out of the frying pan</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the fire," he observed. "Better stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own dumb self and take no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances. Besides, there is no necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">as yet for your researches to be brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to a head. So far, the isotopes seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be inheriting the earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have a feeling that it won't last</seg><seg type="columnLine">much longer," Ken declared prophet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ically, and plunged back into his work</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was right. The first intimation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trouble came from an entirely unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected source. One night, just as Ken</seg><seg type="columnLine">was leaving the laboratory in bleary-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed despair, there came a timid, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">insistent knock on the front door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill, in slippers and dressing gown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was comfortably ensconced in a lounge</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, reading the latest report of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">isotope psychologist on certain neuronic</seg><seg type="columnLine">paths in the cortices of the brain. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">read on in fascinated interest. Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in luminous detail, were proved theories</seg><seg type="columnLine">at which he himself had only dimly nib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled. He had known the man in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pre-dissociated state as a dull, plodding</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of a fellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good night!'' he muttered to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. "Perhaps Ken is wrong after all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps-" Then came the knock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With an exclamation of annoyance</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shuffled his slippers to the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Ken, coming in from the lab,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself wearily into the chair he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just vacated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken heard the door open, saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim, muffled figure, heard Bill's sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation. Even when the midnight</seg><seg type="columnLine">intruder walked into the room, he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not at once raise his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a voice, timid, yet filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange excitement. "Mr. Craig! Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Craig!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked up quickly, gasped. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him stood a heavy, low-browed in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual, with jutting jaw and unpre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessing features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jim Horty!" he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE ex-condemned criminal was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivering with unnamable dread. "Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir, it's me. I've got to talk to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where have you been? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped out of sight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Horty reddened. As a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, from the most publicized man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world, he had gradually been shuf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled into the background, until even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs had forgotten his very existence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was free to come and go as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased, and when he finally disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, no one seemed aware of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Well--I--that is"--he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around in some embarrassment--"I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of hanging around the camp in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smokies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What on earth for?" Ken demanded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His embarrassment grew. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted his weight from leg to leg.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well--I was sort of hoping I'd see</seg><seg type="columnLine">my other self.

Horty gulped. "But that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't what I wanted to tell you, sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hanging around like that, I found out</seg><seg type="columnLine">something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The recessive fellows are revolting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They've started already on the march.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They've got guns and bayonets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything.

Let those recessives gain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">control and-" His voice trailed off,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was only too evident what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm coming, too," Bill decided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two minutes later the three men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding swiftly through the deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">early-morning streets of New York,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing their car to the utmost. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Bronx, they raced; up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albany Post Road, flinging left into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side road that led to the Stubbs labo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratories with a scream of recalcitrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">tires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> STUBBS, awakened at their insist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, viewed Craig with cold, hate-filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Somehow, he felt his former as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistant to be a threat against the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">order he had created. Ken returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his look with interest, but there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for that. He explained rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Incredulity lurked in the dictator's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze when he had finished, even after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Horty's breathless corroboration. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of the rebels' leader brought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp pang to his system, a resurgence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that former overwhelming feeling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled inextricably with queer dread.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had tried to school himself against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought of that other ego, so like</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, yet so different.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If this is a hoax," he said angrily,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll-" He left the threat hanging,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moved toward his commuincations</seg><seg type="columnLine">visor. Even as he did so it buzzed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang into life. A badly frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">isotope, Governor of the Southeastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coastal District, leaped into being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The recessives have broken loose,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he gasped. "A hundred thousand of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. They--they're animals, sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They're killing and burning and wal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing in blood.

We can't hold out much</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer unless we get help."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A concussion of sound shook the</seg><seg type="columnLine">televisor. The governor jerked around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw up his hand in terror. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear, a door burst inward, and a horde</seg><seg type="columnLine">of savage-looking men streamed in. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the helpless, horrified eyes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">onlookers they deliberately bayoneted</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the governor, stabbing again and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fiendish delight. Then they threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves down on the blood-smeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and lapped with greedy tongues</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the thing they had mangled. Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt suddenly sick. He could look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that far-off scene no longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the creatures raised himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the televisor. For one long mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment Stubbs, the recessive, stared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate-filled, triumphant gaze into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzed eyes of Stubbs, the dominant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isotope confronted isotope. Then, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliberately, his fist lifted, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">image shattered with a shiver of broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. The visor screen went blank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now do you believe?" Ken asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterly. He was shaken to his very</seg><seg type="columnLine">core by what he had seen. Yet even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bitterness, his anger against this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who was solely responsible for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror that had been unloosed upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, he felt quick pity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stubbs stood there, rigid, immobile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his .face more angular in its sudden hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowness than ever before.

He sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the visor screen, pressed button after</seg><seg type="columnLine">button.

Strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons of offense and defense that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ken had never heard of were named</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instant use. The isotope scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">had evolved terrible engines of destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Yet always, monotonously re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iterated, Stubbs insisted to all his sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinates : "The recessive Stubbs, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">isotope, is not to be harmed, on peril</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your head.

Kill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a human being, he declared, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in self-defense, was murder!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The unit moved swiftly, in small mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torized tanks capable of a hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour over the most rugged terrain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The superisotopes were grim, purpose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, efficient in their every move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stubbs, bleak and craggy as ever, led</seg><seg type="columnLine">the van. Ken and Bill sat at his side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">marveling at the smoothness with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beryllium-steel tank ripped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the southern highways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reports came to them at five-minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals by radio from fast scout</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes. The rebels had scattered, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling now in small bands, mopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the countryside with remorseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughness. Ken saw the results of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their handiwork as the tank entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">devastated area. It was frightful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everywhere were smoking ruins;</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere the butchered bodies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, women and children stared up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sightless eyes at the smoke-grimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">skies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken's eyes narrowed. Bill muttered:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good Lord!" over and over. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs maintained a flinty silence. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes passed over and through the sham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles with far-off blankness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Early that afternoon they made con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact. The ether cracked with messages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A scout plane reported the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large body of the recessives at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">site of what had once been Charlotte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ville. Now it was a pillar of fire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cloud of smoke in which the dim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen forms of the yelling horde seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like sooty demons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stubbs snapped out orders into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmitter unit.

A half dozen planes were div-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing headlong, recklessly, toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame-shot, ruining town. Tiny figures</seg><seg type="columnLine">squatted on the ground, pointing long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barreled anti-aircraft guns at the diving</seg><seg type="columnLine">targets. The earth shook with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder of exploding bombs, the dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">concussions of motorized artillery. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurid flare of burning houses made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister back-drop to a hellish scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One by one the planes jerked in mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">air as if on a string, crashed in flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For Heaven's sake, Stubbs," Ken</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed, "give the signal to attack."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the isotope scientist made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">move. His eye was glued to the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periscope that angled through the ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mored roof of the tank, straining with</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate eagerness to distinguish those</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-of figures--as though he were seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for some one he dreaded to see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the recessives were already aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the appearance of these new enemies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huge guns swiveled around. Puffs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white smoke rose lazily. The air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly filled with whining concus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions. Two of the tanks shuddered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaved, and exploded into a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling fragments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The transmitter buzzed with angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamor. Why wasn't Stubbs signaling</seg><seg type="columnLine">an attack? Were they to wait until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were picked off one by one?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But still the scientist said nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed in a trance, a moveless fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure at the periscope. Shells hurtled by,</seg><seg type="columnLine">searing the atmosphere with the friction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their flight. Another tank disin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tegrated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil!" Bill ejaculated. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I only knew how to manipulate these</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned weapons!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ken had sprung to the radio,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldering Stubbs rudely out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. He flipped the transmitter open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked out orders in the staccato brit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle accents of the bemused dictator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A ROAR of acquiescence swept back</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ether. Tiny, blue flames</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickered from outlets in the smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">surfaces of the still-surviving tanks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ridiculous little lights that seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">end not a foot away from the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">origin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet Ken, watching the distant town</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the view porte, gasped in in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credulous astonishment. Guns, men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors, even the back-drop of flaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">embers, seemed to whiff out of exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence in a long, clean swath. A deep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone-shaped furrow extended suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through smoking fields, with its apex at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tanks, and its base the obliterated</seg><seg type="columnLine">town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What--what was that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stubbs looked dully at him.

"Merely an atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">disintegrator. Nothing at all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great heavens!" Ken exploded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mean to say you discovered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle already?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mere child's play," the scientist an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered indifferently. "Half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">men came upon it simultaneously. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The radio drowned him out. "Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trict Supervisor Graham calling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commander!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stubbs opened the transmitter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What is it ?" he asked, wearily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir, we've located the main body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the recessives.

"I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">know what's come over our men, sir.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I--I wish you'd come up and take com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be there in an hour, Graham,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stubbs snapped. "Too bad you can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle the situation yourself," he fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished sarcastically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will be splendid, sir," Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered eagerly. And his voice stilled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Exactly an hour later the tanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed up the steep slope to the hud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled ranks of the isotopes. Some ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand there were, with strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squat-looking machines in serried rows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wide, gaping mouths pointing up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward at the mountaintop. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed trouble among the isotopes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were gesticulating and arguing an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grily among themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stubbs jerked out of the tank</seg><seg type="columnLine">stormily. The strange paralysis that</seg><seg type="columnLine">clogged his faculties back at Charlotte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ville had fallen from him like an out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn cloak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ken and Bill hurried out after him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ken's brows were knitted. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely something wrong with Stubbs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the isotopes in general. But puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled as he might, the solution had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawned on him as yet. Though some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing Horty had said the night before</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New York should have been suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient hint to piece the riddle together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham, the supervisor, saw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming, extricated himself from a knot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of quarreling isotopes, hurried toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. A desperate anguish struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">mightily on his harried features with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the respect due the dictator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the three men and their follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers from the other tanks stopped short</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly. They had seen !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up the mountain, not two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards away, a skillfully enfiladed series</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trenches bit deep into the soil. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain's flanks were broad, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trenches stretched interminably up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. A hundred thousand men could</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie concealed within those zigzagging</seg><seg type="columnLine">slashes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was not that which stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">them dead in their tracks, brought low</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamations to their lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ALONG the nearest trench, boldly</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed to the weapons of the super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isotopes, men were parading, carelessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconcernedly. Recessives, weaponless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">marching back and forth in slow, pac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing movement, fronting them with grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning countenance, anxious to be seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be observed by every member of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostile force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tank man screamed suddenly, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">believingly.

His simulacrum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mirror image, stared down from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trench rim, alike in every lineament,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every trick of gesture. Only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes were different.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham came up puffing. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what's wrong, sir," he reported in pant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, hurried tones to Stubbs. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I couldn't attack. The recessives</seg><seg type="columnLine">are watching us through powerful tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopes.

"That's how the trouble started.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had no compunctions about de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroying the recessives. But the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed themselves around the disin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tegrators. There was a fight--a fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">among our own men." His voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashamed. "More than a score were</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed. And all the while the rebels line</seg><seg type="columnLine">their trenches, sneering openly at us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">A tank man came forward determin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ISOTOPE MEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">edly, saluted.

And, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first coming of the green light, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air in the tunnel shot forward with tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nado force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It sent Driggs sprawling to the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He rolled over and over, then his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned lengthwise of the tube and slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">at frightful speed as the pull of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solenoid and the hurricane of wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept him on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last he crashed against a solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall and lay battered and breathless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking above him at a vent out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the air rushed. But at one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the purple passage to the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrine--the temple of Dra Vonga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dragged himself toward the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage while the wind battered against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and held him almost immovable</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the end wall. But, at last, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell into the cool, purple light, and ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him was not darkness as had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case before, but the soft opalescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing of the dome above the throne</seg><seg type="columnLine">room of the ruler of the Xandrian</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a matter of minutes only until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood on the platform where Katha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rine had been. He counted the arch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, then ran swiftly but soundlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the third arch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Darkness lay beyond, and out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness came sounds: the soft whir</seg><seg type="columnLine">of generators turning at high speed; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">recurrent sighing, and a shrill tremu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lousness above the range of sound that</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught Driggs' nerves and set them</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrating in sympathy; and other sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">less easily identified. The torture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that soundless quiver was beyond bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But down there somewhere Duvau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rier had seen machines and haa felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold, torturing flames. The green light</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tunnel meant that the big coils</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in operation. And now, in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of abomination, Katharine Put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nam was a captive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew it, suddenly, with sure cer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty, and he flung himself forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the dark. For three strides he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor beneath him, then that ended.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He pitched forward; then blue light</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamed upward from below and</seg><seg type="columnLine">played upon him as he fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XIII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE LIGHT was like a fountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water. It buoyed him up; the solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust of it came up from beneath and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held him. But, after a moment, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountain sank and lowered him gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the hard surface of a floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fountain of light, splashing about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, had cut off his view. He had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. Now all that was gone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he scrambled to his feet and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, then left, trying to see every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was in a room--a place filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery. Twenty feet above him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling reflected a ghastly green light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light came from some distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">source, but it flooded across under that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling and poured down upon the pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished metal and glass of great machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set them to glittering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamos whirled and made steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">green lines of light. Strange devices</seg><seg type="columnLine">with big gleaming balls of metal above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them reflected from a thousand curves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and here and there great quartz tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">held light of their own--wavering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet light that played incessantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet all this meant nothing. Driggs</seg><seg type="columnLine">was looking for the girl and nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">else mattered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran one hand into his pocket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped the bulb end of his weapon. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not even know what the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, but it was a ray projector of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort, and he knew how that ray had</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn at his brain. He pulled the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his pocket and held it in his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then stepped silently forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sound had filled the room, as wel!</seg><seg type="columnLine">as light. That humming whir that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard before came from the dy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLUE MAGIC</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">namos, and off at the right a purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">light imprisoned in a spiral of glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew from a mere pin point to a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing mass, then died away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighed with an almost human breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">each time that it waned. And over all</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sound Driggs could not identify</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a weird, ghostly singing like night</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind in the shrouds of a ship--a wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">that blew without ceasing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But these were noises only of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines, and his ears were straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear other sounds--voices--Katha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rine Putnam's voice. Yet it seemed he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was alone, until, pat-patting through</seg><seg type="columnLine">these other noises, was the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare feet running on stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From among the machines something</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted forward and stopped by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiral of glass. And the green light</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down from above and threw its</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly glow over what seemed the liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mummy of a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was something that lived, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no right to be among the li"inf ,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something--Driggs knew this suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">--whose whole body had been blasted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duvaurier's hand had been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man stood in front of the purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and watched it as it grew and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded and gradually grew again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung his withered, shriveled body</seg><seg type="columnLine">from side to side, in time with the light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his skin creased stiffly like old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown parchment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly, his swaying motion ended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he threw himself upon the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then rolled over and over, shrieking with</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter. Driggs got one look at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrunken face and knew the man's rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The laughter ceased abruptly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunken eyes stared at Driggs. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a wild flinging of arms and legs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brown, naked thing came to its feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and darted back among the machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his voice rose in a shrill scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lie ran toward the source of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green light, and his screams stopped,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not far away. Then other sounds came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A woman spoke sharply, and a deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice barked sounds such as the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">men used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRST VOICE was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Katharine Putnam's. It might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been Dra Vonga's--Driggs could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. But the sounds were near. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped his weapon beneath his khaki</seg><seg type="columnLine">C02t, but kept his hands on the firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever. Then he ran where the withered</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A battery of cylinders with funnel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped tops reached away in a curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. Above each was a black disk in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ceiling, and Driggs knew, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he was straining to throw him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self forward, that here were the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erators of the blue flames he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the temple room above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cylinders blocked off the view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what lay beyond, but light, ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">green, came from something back there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a barking shout sounded loud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, suddenly, a girl's voice cried out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Katharine Putnam, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound checked Driggs for one instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," she said, "I will never con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Driggs did not mean to call out. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to rush in silently, but one cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wrung from him. "Kitten!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called, and heard her reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ranee!" a piercing cry. And again:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ranee!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Driggs ran swiftly past the bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery of gleaming machines--on, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a green flame blazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The green light blinded him only for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant, then he saw figures. Dra</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vonga, standing--and the green light</seg><seg type="columnLine">sallowed her skin and made her dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes look haggard, draining even Dra</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vonga of her beauty. She was wear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a robe of some soft, dark material</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hung in graceful folds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beside her was a pedestal that ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a flat top. A metal arm arched above</seg><seg type="columnLine">92</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and held a single brilliant point of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">light above the pedestal top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arkos stood near, and he took one</seg><seg type="columnLine">step toward Driggs before Dra Vonga</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "No!" and stopped him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The withered man was crouched on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor at Dra Vonga's feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Driggs was darting wild glances</seg><seg type="columnLine">about. He called once, "Kitten!" then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw her, locked in a whirl of flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Green flames! Here was the source</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light that flooded the room. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no; they were blue; but they whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a central core of yellow light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that projected above the blue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached in a round bar of yellow to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Singing flames! For the weird, wail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing song he had heard came from them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blue flames whirled at blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed and sang as they whirled until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they fused together and made a cylin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der of light, and the yellow inner core</seg><seg type="columnLine">merged with it in green, spectral glow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. A blue, whirling wall; and inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue flame, in the golden central</seg><seg type="columnLine">core, Katharine Putnam was standing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was looking directly at him, star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the whirl of flame, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow of it merged with the red of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress to make it seem black and leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face whiter by contrast. She said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, but looked at Driggs from</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, horror-filled eyes, until he moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward her. Then she called out:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't!" she cried. "Don't touch it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ranee! The flame-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stopped, and again stood staring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cylinder--Driggs knew it now for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time--was shrinking, drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in closer and closer to the slender figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As if from some terrible distance he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Dra Vonga laughing--soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">throaty laughter. Then she was speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See, Ranee Driggs, this little brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">man beside me.

Soon this Kitten will</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer attract you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> DRIGGS turned and whipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white weapon from beneath his coat. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">glinted with deadly menace under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green light. He aimed it first at Dra</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vonga, then at Arkos, then swung it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turn it off," he said. "Quick!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quick, I say!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dra Vonga was not ten feet away;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arkos was a little nearer because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one move he had made.

She said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You dare to threaten me?" And after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she made sounds such as the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones used, and the sounds sent Arkos</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward in one giant leap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Driggs caught him in mid-air with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his weapon, then sprang aside to let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big green body crash to the floor.

Turn it off, I say! I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">count three."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dra Vonga laughed then, easily, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidently. She reached out with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and brought it under the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of white light so that the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her hand fell on the plate beneath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The deadly menace of the green light</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted, but the song of the flames</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to a lower, droning note.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From back of him, Katharine Put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nam's voice said, "It's moved away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from me, Ranee. The circle is bigger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now it's holding still."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dra Vonga let her hand fall to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. "No one but Dra Vonga," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "knows the secret of this.

When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he straightened he had Arkos' weapon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had also his own .45.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, though he knew it was foolish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the feel of it in his hand gave him new</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> HE snapped it open with a jerk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrist, throwing the cylinder out</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideways.

It lighted Katharine Putnam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and made very lovely the soft oval</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it and the delicate olive tints in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin. But it showed, too, a little flush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heightened color in each cheek, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's eyes were very steady and</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly contemptuous when they rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Dra Vonga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dra Vonga was reclining indolently</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a broad and very long flat couch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carved apparently from a single block</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dark wood and richly inlaid with</seg><seg type="columnLine">other woods of delicate sheen.

It was thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">negligently across Dra Vonga's reclin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing figure, and the filmy laces with Dra</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vonga's creamy skin and her hair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun gold were sheer beauty against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darker background.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Katharine was standing. She crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room to an embrasure in the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood looking out. A huge gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship of metal was out there on a wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">checkered pavement. It was the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had brought Ranee Driggs and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Earth.

"That's Fozan," Driggs said ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sently, but his thoughts were elsewhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm beginning to get it," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And all this helps.

He stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved to them. Then Driggs, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, stared beyond the bronzed figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fozan and made inarticulate sounds in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his throat. He was looking at a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast that came out from among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees and stood looking up the hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the same as the one he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Katharine had seen from the ship--an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous brute, its body slung close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground, long, shaggy hair almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushing the rock on which it stood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its head was mounted on a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leathery neck; and the head, with little</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears pricked forward, was high in air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointed uphill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wind blew down the slope, and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent must have come to the beast, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it opened its mouth and emitted a sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle scream, a blast of savage fury that</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked Driggs to his feet; then stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dashed down the slope with clat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering sounds as the beast charged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Driggs turned. Back of him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green guards were staring past him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their mouths were opened wide. They,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, screamed, but their cries were cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear. They tugged at their weapons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turned and ran for the caves at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of the gash in the mountain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLUE MAGIC</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">101</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Driggs knew suddenly that Duvaurier</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not moved.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still hanging and fluttering when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gray shape swung toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain and passed almost overhead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Driggs did not move; neither did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe. But his head bent slowly back</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the ship moved above. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching it as the bit of red broke loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was left dancing in the breeze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He slid off the ledge then and moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hill. Duvaurier went with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, while the green guards came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the caves and followed with white tubes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in their hands. At the foot of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree the bit of red came to rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Driggs picked it up, and still he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, but his hands trembled, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were holding a scrap of cloth that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been part of Katharine Putnam's</seg><seg type="columnLine">frock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached in his pocket and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the fragment that had been left in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand when the girl was torn from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in the midday darkness when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was blind.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">speck melted while they watched, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue took it up as if the sky had</seg><seg type="columnLine">blotted it out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are heading," Duvaurier said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"into space."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">XVI.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THEY returned to the ships in si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence, and only one sentence came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Driggs' nervously twitching lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The green guards were back of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could not see when Driggs held out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his two hands and brought the tense</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers curling in toward the palms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll break her--like that!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He regretted it instantly, for Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaurier only glanced at him, then looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and Driggs wondered, if it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a show-down, just how far he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">count on Duvaurier's help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time passed--hours of time.

Scant inches from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center point, Prock called out the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc correction.

Then, slamming</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder viciously against the pprt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he scrambled energetically out upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass-domed observation deck beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the protecting hull of the transport.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The queer ball of greenish mist hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionlessly in black space.

At the polar extrem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity nearest the W62, the strange ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed with a quaint yellowish illumina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were making it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A scant body length from the tip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball opposite the glowing end, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grappling hook in Wiljon Kar's ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended hands sank into the soft, rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery stuff of the ball. With a vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">twist the engineer changed the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his flight so that his head moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly along the contour of the ball to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the glowing end. At the cable's</seg><seg type="columnLine">length behind him followed Hals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no time for fear. Indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wiljon Kar felt as if he were enduring</seg><seg type="columnLine">some strangely wondrous dream. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of the thing was great. Fully ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">times that of the W62. Edging along</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, the grappling hook feeling along</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully as he pulled himself forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rounded the extreme diameter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball and then halted abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suspended beneath the greenish mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">and comprising fully a third of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere there was a shiplike structure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. Midway upon this metal cab ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended a row of fluorescent disks, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximately the width of a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, even as he stared, Wiljon Kar</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensed the subtle flow of energy from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disks. Fully a score of them fo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cused their weird rays to a convergence</seg><seg type="columnLine">some distance from the ship. From this</seg><seg type="columnLine">point a narrow beam of light stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">bevond to the black mass which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the W62. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tugging upon the cable announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hals' approach. Wiljon Kar felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanic's hooked gloves fumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his own space cap. Now the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">flow of energy from Hals' radio phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused him to realize how cold he was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fearful realization charged through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blood. He must hurry. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly freezing to death. And off there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the darlc, lifeless W62 were the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">three faithful ones of the crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hals' whisper cut sharply upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly numbing consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the left-see it, Wiljon Kar?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It looks like a port."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wiljon Kar's gaze became fixed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curious irregularity. Upon this side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strange, glowing disks the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as smooth as glass. Beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disks the remaining mass of the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapered to a single vast torplike pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuberance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THEY had to move slowly and cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously across the slick surface. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest jar would send them spinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">helplessly in space. Eagerly Wiljon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kar's clawing glove tips grasped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight rectangular projection. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling over the smooth metal, seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">vainly to touch some releasing lever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His body felt stiff. There was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">any sensation in his hands and feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hals, too, worked upon the plate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The terrible fear arose that possibly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, this was no port at all. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mechanic was swinging his blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">torch into line. Wiljon Kar strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">to align his own torch so that the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">might eat into the hard metal quick'y.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every move that he made was slow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His body responded with deadening fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tigue. How much longer could he en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dure?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This searing flame of the torches</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded him. By contrast, the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of space seemed a thick, impenetra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble substance. Even the distant sparks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stars were lost from view. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sun, which had been scarcely more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a candle in the eternal night, was lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wiljon Kar felt utterly alone. Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scarcely more than the memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pleasant dream. For a moment he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have lost consciousness. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp cry from Hals beat through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio phone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''We're through the stuff--shut off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout Wiljon Kar's frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">body seared a new consciousness. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt oddly alert; his brain was feverishly</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear. In a gallant upthrust of will, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong stuff of his being exerted itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a last supreme effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beneath them the aperture opened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vast room. Yellowish light, seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly emanating from the stuff of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, made everything as bright as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth day at noon. Swiftly, Wiljon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kar poised above the opening. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As his body slowly descended into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room he grasped the Venusite plate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding it before him as a shield.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Should the strange invaders attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike them down the Venusite, and ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solute ray reflector, would serve to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tect them. In his other hand he still</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried the blasting torch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A peculiar shudder shook the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through the thick soles of his boots</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle points of energy tingled sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The walls of the room grew brilliant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stuff of which they were composed</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming to flow as if a boiling liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">were restrained by some perfectly trans-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">parent shell. Now Hals was beside him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing his huge back against Wiljon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kar's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're getting closer!" Hals ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed. "What to do--quick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wiljon Kar poised alertly. Comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing warmth surged through his body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt suddenly free. And Hals' voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">had rung loudly in the radio phone! In</seg><seg type="columnLine">that brief moment of realization Wiljon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kar understood that the imprisoned en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ergy of the batteries within the suit had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been liberated. Whatever the weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">control these tilings commanded, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least limited within their own ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the walls were closing in upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The fearsome stuff boiled furi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously now and the light grew dazzlingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">white. Yet even before a plan could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">formulated Hals swung up his blasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch, pressed the lever down to full</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. The hot, searing flame leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the creeping wall. Hals swerved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch wildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Glaring blue-white sparks of tortured</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy exploded in blinding sheets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame. The room quivered, and charg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bolts of fiery energy burned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor to the thick soles of their boots</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever a foot was lifted. Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space suits the Earthmen dripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">perspiration. The heat was becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffocating. Yet the horrible advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the walls had ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wiljon Kar was firing his own torch</seg><seg type="columnLine">.now. Twin beams of atom-destroying</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame tore at the wall. The strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowing matter swirled in fantastic cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rents. Then, abruptly, from ceiling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, the wall ripped apart. Hals had</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed it first. Speedily, he grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineer's ami. They hurled their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies through the aperture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> HALS had stopped so abruptly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wiljon Kar ran into him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's dark here--blacker than a Plu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonian eclipse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The wall closed again. We jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out just in time." Wiljon Kar was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AST--7</seg><seg type="columnLine">STRANGER FROM FOMALHAUT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling his way in the darkness. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooring sloped downward in a spiral-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like curve. By extending both arms he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could touch metallic hardness upon each</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They moved forward cautiously now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The place seemed to be some vast tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than a hall. In the bulky space</seg><seg type="columnLine">suits they moved with uncertain steps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so sharp was the decline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's wider now," Wiljon Kar was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying. And then, a little farther on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he suddenly checked their movement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This must be a room. The left wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">curves away at nearly a right angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. And we're somewhere near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">core of the metal part of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?" Hals whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely and moved near so that his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder touched Wiljon Kar's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Straight ahead there--ten yards or</seg><seg type="columnLine">so--there's a round, gray thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady, Hals." Wiljon Kar placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself between the mechanic and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghostly gray sphere. He could see it</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly now. The thing seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">building up energy within itself. Did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he imagine it or was there really a soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsation of energy emanating from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball? It was difficult to determine</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the bulky space suit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Step by step, Wiljon Kar approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing. The sphere grew distinct,</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming now a deep purple and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing until the whole of the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber became suffused with the soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-violet light. The sphere itself was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no larger than a man's head and hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless and unsupported several feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the somber gray metal of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hals had grasped his elbow. "Shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">I blast it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wiljon Kar gestured for Hals to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain his fighting impulse. The mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter engineer's gaze was riveted stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily upon the glowing sphere. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely to breathe at all and every cell</seg><seg type="columnLine">AST-8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in his body was attuned to the intensity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his concentration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, now, he raised the blasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch and deliberately aimed it at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very center of the sphere. Instantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strange thing assumed a weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement. A tentacle of energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned upward to a suddenly charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulb upon the domed ceiling high above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simultaneously Wiljon Kar experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enced a tingling along the arm which</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the torch. Instinctively his fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers tightened upon the firing stud. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came no crash of flame. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch had become a lifeless club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hals, seeing the maneuver, groaned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too late--we could have struck--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Silence," Wiljon Kar commanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply. He was adjusting the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone so that his voice might be broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casted beyond the suit. Then, draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a deep breath and eyeing the sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">squarely, he shouted: "Who are you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stranger from Fomalhaut--in the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the council, I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wiljon Kar's throat constricted pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. He could not continue. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere had become viciously alive. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiery tentacles reached forth to encircle</seg><seg type="columnLine">the daring Earthmen. Wiljon Kar</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhed as the keen lashes cut into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. He felt himself lifted bodily</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the floor. Now he fell before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere, twisting and turning as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought vaintly to escape the vengeful</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a hull roar the maddened Hals</seg><seg type="columnLine">went berserk. Waving his lifeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch in a war club swing he hurled him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self with wild fury toward the menac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ball.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wiljon Kar attempted to get to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet again. The sting of the lashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-blinded him with searing pain. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was crying to Hals. But the crazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanic was beyond hearing commands</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. His voice roared a battle cry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood of Viking ancestors churn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his huge body to a warrior's mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">114</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. To Hals this was death, and death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to such as he, meant the final glorious</seg><seg type="columnLine">flourish of a true fighting man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He charged straight toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere. With all the strength of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty arms, Hals crashed the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch down upon the sphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE ROOM became brilliant with</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet flares. The torch had sunk scant</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches into the strange stuff and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not budged it from its position. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the searing tentacles lashed a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiplike flames about the room. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinging cuts brought a maddened roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Hals, yet he did not go down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bracing his feet firmly he lifted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">torch--crashed it again. Still the fiery</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacles whipped in merciless fury.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hals spat crazed curses from between</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched teeth. But still he fought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again and again the war club beat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the sphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wiljon Kar had scrambled to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was gasping for breath. Hot tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred his vision for the moment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of Hals' enraged curses hammered</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely upon his brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could see clearly now. The light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning flashes of the sphere's energy ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacles illuminated the gruesome place</seg><seg type="columnLine">with glaring brilliancy. The wall be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the sphere was irregular with</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless rows of knoblike extensions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Running swiftly, Wiljon Kar skirted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. Holding his grappling hook</seg><seg type="columnLine">securely lie swung his way up the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes held to the gleaming bulb</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was just above the sphere. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed hotly, sending a steady flow of</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy to the madly flailing sphere just</seg><seg type="columnLine">below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, upon the topmost row of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knobs, Wiljon Kar braced himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With one hand he gripped his torch</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly. Tensing himself, he swung out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His body shot straight toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming disk. Frantically, viciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">he struck. The torch crashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a swishing arc squarely into the disk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as he fell, Wiljon Kar felt his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body tingle from the explosion. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden flare of blinding flame the disk</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to tear itself from the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal of the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hals!" Wiljon Kar cried out as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the floor. He rolled dizzily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then lay still, for a moment, while his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned senses held rigidly. Then si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence and darkness seemed to bury him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with impenetrable vastness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hals was tugging at his suit, calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. Oddly, the mechanic's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was weak and choked as he struggled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe steadily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wiljon Kar," Hals was shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "Are you hurt? Wiljon Kar!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But the sphere!" Wiljon Kar strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled to his feet awkwardly.

Grimly, Hals pointed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There before them, quivering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flabby helplessness, lay the weirdly</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing stuff which had been the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere.

As he went over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last events they seemed far away, a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance. The way he felt traveling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe, with home far away, and a glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling as he finally sailed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">America. Now the feeling was exag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerated, the distance much greater; such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">distance was hard to grasp, and far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from pleasant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The picture of the little laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very clear: the perfect equipment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with every type of television and radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the walls.

He was not dreaming, but awake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">WHERE? The question burned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew fear.

He was utterly and helplessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was the gigantic rotor he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fled from, so exhausted he fell asleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his brain numbed by the energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blades threw off. He had thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it some kind of animal, and that he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape reach of the legs!

They were beyond im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From tip to center axis they stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">a full half mile, and must measure over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile from tip to tip.

The shaft which swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blades slowly around was several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet in diameter, and from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance heavy cables were led down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the nine blades at the top. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing looked, to Tom Corbin, as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">were suddenly the size of a small in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect. Cold sweat poured down his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the change in things and their lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of proportion became apparent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood in a room so vast a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">city could be housed within and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">have room to spare. Slowly turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head, he found other machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the walls, all dwarfed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">central rotor. A hum so smooth it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no vibration brought a sigh of admira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for men who built such perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">working machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not over a quarter of a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wall of the building and hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of smaller machines, standing row</seg><seg type="columnLine">after row, gave hope that men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be found near them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The main machines were dynamos</seg><seg type="columnLine">and converters. But what beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">things: silent, spinning armatures in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside casings, spark gaps that</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatically increased or lessened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They ranged in size from a few feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">high to those one hundred and fifty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. As he watched some would stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">as others started of their own accord,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so automatic it gave the impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men tending them unseen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cabinet to the left attracted his at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention and he wandered that way. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface appeared like glass, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a tint to the clear wall never seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ordinary glass. It had warmth with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intangible old-rose coloring. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">color, yet did not retard the clearness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the panel in any way. But the inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew his attention. It contained con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol boards for all machines in the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It stood thirty feet high by sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">square, with row after row of switches</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening and closing constantly. Watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them closely, Tom could see they</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut out certain machines as others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown into a giant circuit that centered</seg><seg type="columnLine">all action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The energy within that immense box</seg><seg type="columnLine">was inconceivable. It could come only</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a source as great as the rotor in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the building. But where</seg><seg type="columnLine">could the energy be gathered from?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Millions upon millions of volts--enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">lierht and power for the civilized world!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What could be done with it ? Whoever</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed such a planet must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous use for energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he turned away from a scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">more interesting than any play or movie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was because a pang, that recurred so</seg><seg type="columnLine">often it couldn't be denied, told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hadn't eaten for hours. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungrier than he had ever been before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Life hadn't taught him to go without</seg><seg type="columnLine">food for any length of time, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stomach was crying for something</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A MEAL became a very important</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing as he started out to find some one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one! The outside walls showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sign of an opening for a long way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was beginning to despair when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small doorway appeared in the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance. H»: forgot to go slow and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no on,; caught him in his nakedness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The metal door refused to give as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar swung to the side. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">disconcerting and he gave it a jerk that</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have opened it. Instead, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">120</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on his back several feet away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the door still in his hand. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door had pulled out by the hinges!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The metal was very light, and Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">got back to his feet with a queer sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation. The hinges had ripped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal casing as though under ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific strain; and it was with mixed feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that he walked back to the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The distance he landed from the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">was astounding without considering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force cf ripping the metal apart to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">it open. The door had been locked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other side, and lock as well as hinges</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung a wreck in his hand. For a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute, this strange thing held him fasci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated, before stepping through the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into a room about six feet square</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no sign of an opening beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he stood examining the walls for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some opening beyond, the sensation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving became strong. Glancing back</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the engine room he found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sensation of speed increased by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second as he started to throw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight against the partition. Thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">better of it as he remembered the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, he put his hand against the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed tentatively. This wall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger and, after testing it for a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute, he pressed his whole weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wall bulged where his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed and the car began to lurch with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grating sound. When he was thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear of the side by the jerk of the car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal sprang back and the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up speed again. The certainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of speed made him hesitate to break</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Stalling this strange conveyance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be in a worse predicament than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let it travel and see what the result</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air became unpleasantly hot after</seg><seg type="columnLine">several minutes of the terrific speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The friction was heating the air to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high temperature. Touching one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls it burned his hand, and the feel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing came over him that he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned to a crisp if the trip continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">long. The floor was insulated, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed fairly cool. Moving his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept them from getting uncomfortably</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot. The air was getting too hot to</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathe, before the car began to slacken</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The speed lessened for several min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes before the car came to a halt. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip seemed to take an hour. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute of standing, there was a grat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sound at the partition, but it didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. Placing his hand on the wall to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the source, a slight vibration</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It only took a moment for the reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become apparent. The metal couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be moved by the motor operating it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it was bent. Realizing he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">imprisoned, Tom put both hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the surface, trying the panel</seg><seg type="columnLine">first one way then the other until a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack appeared at the edge. Forcing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers through, it took only a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute to slide the panel far enough to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, despite the fact that the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still hot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once on the outside, he pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the plate and was gratified to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the metal straighten to a semblance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its former shape. The motor, pull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from some place out of sight, slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew it back to fit against the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">with only a slight variation to show it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ever out of shape. This was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief. Damage left behind wouldn't set</seg><seg type="columnLine">very well with the beings who owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned his back to the car and</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced a small room with clothing hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the wall, like the dressing room of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a masquerade ball. Gaudy uniforms</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung from hooks, complete with long</seg><seg type="columnLine">swords. But he was still naked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be better to meet people</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in one of these than undressed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking over the clothing, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">one suit about the right size. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little loose but made him feel more</seg><seg type="columnLine">STRANGE CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">121</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like a man. A doorway in the far wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew his attention, while fastening the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last of countless buttons, for the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of voices came drifting on an air</seg><seg type="columnLine">current.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">HE STARTED FORWARD, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated. A feeling of uneasiness crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him, and he took down the sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hung with the uniform, fastening</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belt around his waist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried the steel to be sure it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not soft material like the door he pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart. The metal had a greenish tint</seg><seg type="columnLine">but seemed of excellent quality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passage turned a few feet be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the door, and as he went forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">he watched carefully. Looking around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the turn before stepping out, he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A room full of men, but men of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange race, were gathered around a</seg><seg type="columnLine">table playing some game. He could at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least look them over before they saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their uniforms were similar but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the one he had helped himself to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the men drew attention. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same features as any of the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">race, but the color of their skin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling: a brilliant pink! It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the color of a girl's blush, but the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fresh bum, with no counterpart in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ordinary complexion. It was a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct color of its own. Yet they looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like so many men dressed for a mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">querade ball. The color was not dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasing, but looked as if they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">never out in the sun; always lived in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hothouse. They carried swords at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sides, worn enough on the hilt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know they were not carried for appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When one of them glanced up, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">-startled exclamation brought the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their feet and Tom faced a row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn swords. The men filled the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">from wall to wall, silently watching as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he stepped around the corner into full</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. There was a minute of silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Tom managed to say "hello," al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though knowing they couldn't under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand from the few words spoken while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stood stupefied a minute longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">before one of them could manage a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word. Tom listened respectfully to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man said, but it sounded different</seg><seg type="columnLine">from anything he had ever heard. Shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his head he tried to show them he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was friendly. He stepped forward hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out his hand but they only raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">their swords higher. Finding this</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't work he tried rubbing his stom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ach and pointing to his mouth to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was hungry, but they still stood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a minute, the man tried again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It sounded like a different tongue, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke slowly. Tom shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A puzzled frown appeared this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a fleeting look of distrust. He gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">an order and the men dropped their</seg><seg type="columnLine">swords and came toward him. His own</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword, in the belt at his side, was use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, so he waited to see what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted. But when one of them grabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him around the legs it was too much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted to be friendly and they tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to knock him down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reaching down he caught hold of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man at his legs, tossing him in the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the others before they could get hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. They were knocked back ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet as they fell like tenpins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This sobered them and, scrambling</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their swords, they kept back as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible from this wild man. Won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and a little awe showed in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces now. They didn't seem anxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">to try again. As he faced them across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room Tom thought of the sword at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side and wasted no time drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Since they weren't friendly, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't going to be caught napping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader picked out three men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four came slowly forward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn swords. He smiled to think they</seg><seg type="columnLine">122</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had more respect than when try ing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture him a moment before. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader would be the worst to face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he watched him carefully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> TOM was in a tight spot. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to hurt them as he needed friends.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had no quarrel with them. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not his fault he faced, them now, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't intend to be cut up if he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">help it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When only a few feet remained, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed. It was all he could do to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">from running them through as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked their blades aside. Swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiously the blade of the leader was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first ne touched. His blade was</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling so fast when they met that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other sword was thrown ten feet away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next one broke short as the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">two were knocked out of the men's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They retreated at this, talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">amongst themselves. The leader came</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and spoke again. Tom didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand, but knew he was asking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question. Later he found it was lucky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an answer would probably have cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life for being a liar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man was very grave as he asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who are you that wear the clothes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a god and fight like fifty men?" His</seg><seg type="columnLine">face fell as Tom shook his head, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he understood the smile. That meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendliness, and as none were hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly they put away their swords.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When Tom replaced his they seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much relieved. Beckoning him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow they entered a passage on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With some misgiving he followed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they showed good will by going ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a minute, the leader dropped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to walk by his side. He couldn't fail</seg><seg type="columnLine">to admire the tremendous courage it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have taken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they walked, the man timidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out to feel the muscle in Tom's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. The wonder appearing in his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was eloquent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom thought it a friendly gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he reached over and did the same,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but was sorry when the man winced</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bit his lip to keep from crying out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How it must have hurt, although unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentionally! The man's arm was soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his thumb sank in an inch before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized he could break it with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The feeling that everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong returned as he tried to show the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man he was sorry. The flesh of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">people was very tender, more like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new-born baby than full-grown men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man he tossed across the room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely light as well, seeming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">weigh no more than twenty pounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they walked, Tom wondered what</seg><seg type="columnLine">material the floor was made of. Instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hard feeling of stone it felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">springy as though covered with carpet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It gave a bouncing sensation rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant to walk on. The man couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his hands off Tom and kept reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out to feel of his arms. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a great wonder to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Passing branch after branch in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel, they approached stronger light</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it widened at the entrance of a room</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would hold a thousand people with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out crowding. Everything was of stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no sign of the metal that</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in the engine room, anywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight. The benches were worn in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollows and at every door deep grooves</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed the passing of time. The room</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been here a long time. It was tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture to think he could ask about noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but had to content himself with sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">language.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader of the guard, or "Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral" as he nicknamed him, had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">a liking to him and spent his time peer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into his face and examining him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from head to foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room they were in contained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred more men in uniform similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the others and they gathered around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newcomers, pointing and asking ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cited questions. It struck Tom so funny</seg><seg type="columnLine">STRANGE CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he couldn't help smiling, which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to embarrass them, but only for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wonder in their faces made Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick up the General and hold him above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head with one hand, to show he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually a man. A shout went up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throng as they drew their swords</seg><seg type="columnLine">menacingly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Too late, he realized the mistake, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to see it through, so he set the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his shoulder and stood his ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man in his hands hadn't said a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his face masked his feelings. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the action of the others in the room he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a man of importance and Tom's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind raced for a way of straightening</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' Setting him on his feet carefully, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed, then pulling the sword from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scabbard handed it over hilt first. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the right impression and the ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of a moment before melted away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> HIS -NEW FRIEND took the sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">very seriously, saying a few words be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore handing it back. Tom breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier as the men lost their hostile look</seg><seg type="columnLine">and resumed conversation. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">General took him by the arm, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked slowly across the room to sit at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beckoning to one of the men he sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on an errand, after several minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of conversation. The rest of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the room kept a respectful distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">but talked excitedly as they glanced in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they had been waiting several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, he called the General's atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, making motions to show he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry. It was quite a job to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man understand, but when he did two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men went hurrying away to do his bid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding. In a short time they were back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with several girls evidently of a servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">class, carrying trays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had cloths wrapped around</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in place of clothes and were afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coming close to the stranger until</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the general spoke to them. Then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached to serve the dishes. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a little reassured when Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled, but still glad to keep back when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they finished their duties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They carried food of a dozen kinds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all smelled delicious at the moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None was familiar, and he tasted each</seg><seg type="columnLine">before deciding upon a food that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very pleasant, tasting like mushrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">with some delicate meat added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl who tended the table handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a piece of metal shaped like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oyster shell and it took several minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to decide what to do with it. One edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sharpened to cut with, and if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges were pressed it hollowed like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoon. After a little practice it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed knife, fork, and spoon very</seg><seg type="columnLine">nicely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While eating, the serving girls caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention. Their coloring was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same as the men in the room but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed chiseled out of marble, stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing perfectly still until he wanted some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, when the head girl would wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him. The features of each were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect he forgot to eat, lost in admira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, until the General motioned him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hurry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he finished the meal, the messen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger returned and bowed slightly before</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking. Tom was motioned to fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low again as they left through a side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Entering a car that rattled and shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it rose, the party ascended story after</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. The car rose fully a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and al! the way it made Tom nerv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous listening to -the straining as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeaked to the top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passages at the upper level were</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliantly lighted and as they walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">along people stopped to stare. Hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds were wandering along as if walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing were the only occupation. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dressed in brilliant clothes and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women's dress vied with the men's in</seg><seg type="columnLine">color. Everything was like a giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mardi gras.</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one seemed seriously occupied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The women did not appear as beauti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful as the servant girls, being thinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and much more ana;mic looking. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked cultured, but showed a complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of physical exercise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little farther they entered a door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, where Tom found himself in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other car similar to the one that brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from the engine room. But this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also in a bad state of repair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked along its track which felt worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the breaking point. Tom knew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves wouldn't stand much more rack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing when they came to a halt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">THE GENERAL took his arm as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they passed row after row of standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards. Swords were presented and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling of importance began to creep</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him. Why they should honor him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a perfect stranger was beyond un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstanding. Tom watched everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">they passed, closely, and was surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see light bulbs broken every little</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, left as they were in the sockets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not replaced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lack of repair was terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">amongst such perfect machinery. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of mechanical equipment they passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far better than anything Tom had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen, but badly in need of work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Things were so different from the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine room where everything was in per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect shape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't have long to think about it</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they entered a doorway into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast chamber. At the other end a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat on a high chair from which he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see well over the heads of others in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. He knew they had entered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne room and he was being taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">before a ruler. Every guard in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party flattened himself on the floor ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept the General who bent one knee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To follow suit, seemed the thing to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ruler was far from pleased that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't join the men on the floor but</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending his knee was as far as Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go. When he saw the expression</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the man's face he w?s sorry he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">done that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were called forward and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">for several minutes while the "Ruler"</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked to the General. Tom stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">through an examination lasting several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes before the man was satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turning to the General spoke a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">more words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The General called over one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards, whose knees shook as he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, and motioned for Tom to lift</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He was the biggest man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group and Tom had some misgiving as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whether he could handle him, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man didn't weigh over twenty pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he held him over his head. Seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it pleased the Ruler he tossed him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air about twenty feet, and, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men in the room groaned, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as easily as a rubber ball.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When set back on his feet the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook like a leaf and had lost all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">color he ever had. The look on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces made Tom laugh and suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach forward to the block of stone the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne stood on, raising it slightly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone would weigh several tons if as</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy as he was used to, but this only</seg><seg type="columnLine">required a little exertion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ruler jumped as the stone slanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">but was soon all smiles again as Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to talk to him. After several</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruitless attempts he gave up, while Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried every language he had an inkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of. He knew a little French, German</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Spanish but none were understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ruler beckoned to him, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he came closer, felt of his arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This seemed the strangest of all and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardness of his muscles held the man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">awe. Several times he let go, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out again, trying to believe it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was real and not imaginary. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom flexed his muscle he was delighted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had him do it several times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Tom was led away he could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gradual swelling conversation in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">they passed objects Tom named them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in English while the General gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name in his own tongue. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reached their destination the names</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twenty objects were understandable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and several more he was not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">III.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THEY finally reached the apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">assigned to him, and, as he examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, three of the girls who brought his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner in the lower chamber, entered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The one who served the food was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought forward by the General and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented to Tom. It was hard to un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand what was meant but he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was being given to him, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact they were slaves became a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she started to kiss the floor at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet he grabbed her by the shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, jerking her erect. He was sorry</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute later; he had forgotten his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and it shook her up quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit. His action seemed a complete sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise to her as well as the General as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she backed away cringing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later he learned it was a means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing displeasure to stop their</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeisance and he hurt the girl's feelings</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than he hurt her physically. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">General tried to replace her with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other girls and it wa&gt; hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuade Him he hadn't shown dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom called the girl back and stroked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her head, but as she bent toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor he stopped her. He wouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, and the easiest way was to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in the beginning. Although the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a puzzled look, adoration shone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes, and from that moment she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">never out of his sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The other girls came forward and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">General made it known they were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve, but they didn't try to kiss the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. When he was left alone he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head girl by the arm, motioning for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to show him around. She seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarrassed to have him touch her but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she obeyed. It was not for her to ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion anything the master did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The apartment had outside windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she took him to look out. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pulled back the curtain a faint glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared and in a minute he was gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the strangest scene man ever saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A purple light covered the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. The window was slightly above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground or possibly he was looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at gardens on the roof of the building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was a mile in extent. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had the strange lack of deep color</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people showed and though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth of plant life was very thick it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked sickly and pale. The sky was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a purple glow that started nowhere and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trying to show the girl the shape of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sun and the light from it was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a task, but he finally made her under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand he was asking about a big light in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. After considerable time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found there was no other light at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">time than the purple glow before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The reason for the people being so pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">became apparent, with no stronger light</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a glow equal to very early dawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they returned to the room for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping, Tom had her name every ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject he could find. This went on for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time and he wouldn't have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied then, if she had been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide a yawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He realized everything was still. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the building had throbbed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">life earlier. Try as he might he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get her out of the room, so at last he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to go to bed with his clothes on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This didn't suit her in the least and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she tried taking them off, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">adamant. Evidently the men had girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">servants who waited on them at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">126</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">times, as this girl was very much hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he wouldn't let her put him to bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was with a very uncomfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling that he lay down on the pad in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner and fell asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he awoke the first thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his eye was the cloth the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had around her the night before, hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a rack at the side of the room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could just see her bare arm lying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor at the foot of his bed. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spent the rest time on the stone at .</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet, and removed her cloth to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom found himself more embarrassed</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he ever remembered, and was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a quandary as to what to do. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare get out of bed. She might wake</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and chase him around without both-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering to put anything on. He soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that thought of propriety between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the masters and slaves didn't exist, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more considered than animal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">master. Although amongst people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same class the strictest rules were</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He decided to make enough noise to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake her up, then turn his face to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall while she donned her robe, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it was not much more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bath towel thrown around her. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time he gave a little cough she</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed on the floor beside his bed, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An argument started shortly when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she tried to get him to take a bath. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">water poured constantly through a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool adjoining the room and she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">her best to get him to take a bath while</seg><seg type="columnLine">she held a towel and what looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar soap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was too much and after con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable motioning Tom got her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the room. It was not without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt look, and lack of understanding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she withdrew. While lying in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool he could see a stool a short way</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him with a clean uniform laid out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he came out of the water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started toward the clothes on the chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">he jumped. The girl had appeared be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him and started to rub down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. This time he gave up trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change their customs to suit himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From then on he put up with the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant at all the occasions he was used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to privacy and it was not long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he became accustomed to her company</seg><seg type="columnLine">and paid no more attention to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE GIRL had an appeal of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, and as time went by he was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more to her society. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time in his life he watched for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest movement of a girl. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he was immune but this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had become very seriously interested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several days passed with the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">other company a call from the General</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day, or between the times he slept,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they ate only one meal. The Ruler</seg><seg type="columnLine">was allowing him to learn the language</seg><seg type="columnLine">before trying to converse again. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">time passed he mastered one word after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another until he had a faint grasp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation, from then on learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl seemed tireless; and he spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour after hour talking to her. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">for more than five minutes at a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">night or day, was she away from him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the thought came that he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost if he gave up her company. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he had known her it was different.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now that she had become a part of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">daily life it would be like tearing away</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their conversation covered every part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life in Borid, as the city was called.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he couldn't find what country he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in. Every question asked about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">location of Borid only brought a puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He no longer tried to explain how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came. He didn't know. But he did tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">about some of the life He led before</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming. It seemed as marvelous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as this country did to him, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to understand the reason for there</seg><seg type="columnLine">being no sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time was not a set thing, but varied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">STRANGE CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">127</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and though the masters slept at certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">times it was because the Ruler set aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">every so often for sleep. The time was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rung on bells throughout the city when-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever he happened to get sleepy. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girls were enslaved from child-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood, he learned; had been slaves for</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many generations the time was lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in history. Originally they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured from a distant city, the name</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which had been forgotten, as genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions lived and died without communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation. With the gods had ended all</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gods were the builders of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great city, with lighting systems and ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines that carried on their work</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the ages. They had been gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">for untold time and still the machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on untended. When one went</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong it was discarded. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">replacement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people inhabiting the city were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a race the gods befriended when their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own people were dying off, bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and their slaves within the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">to act as guards and do the work re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired. The gods, or engineers, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">built the great machines died with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical knowledge possessed by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people of the city knew the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them went the way Tom came--into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building several distances below</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. He was looked upon as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gods returned. Back through an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiquity they had guarded the way, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was far from the way history told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them he should look. They were weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lings. he a giant in strength, but after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first scare it was decided he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come from the gods or he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have entered through the forbidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he mastered enough of the lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage to converse with the General it</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a certainty he was a messenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the gods. He knew a great deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">about machinery and fixed various lit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tle electrical appliances they brought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, although he thought it just a favor</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he repaired the different things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The period of inaction on his part</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave plenty of time for thought. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">conviction he was in a different world</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew. In some inexplicable way the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new radio wave had carried him over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The giant rotor had drawn him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine room and deposited him near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the axis. His escape was miraculous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He passed the worst torment from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power before full consciousness re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, and blind instinct carried his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in the right direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The world he landed in was like their</seg><seg type="columnLine">world of five thousand years before, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the highest developed engineering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The warmth of the buildings, the light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every known convenience was an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heritance from a race nonexistent for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of years. What they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">or where they came from was a mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery. The servant girl gave little rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son for the present race knowing noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about machinery or the things they</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in daily life: The gods had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">them into the city and turned over com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts built for another race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engineering died with the gods</seg><seg type="columnLine">who kept mechanical knowledge as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold over the multitude brought within</seg><seg type="columnLine">their doors. They taught them to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">all mechanical equipment alone by shut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting off the power when the guests tres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed too far; and the fear of touch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing anything had grown to be a religion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The race of people who left all the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts rose higher and higher in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">esteem until they were worshiped as</seg><seg type="columnLine">deities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Placing the races in their proper posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion eased his mind considerably. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared the engineers' discovery of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence until it became a certainty he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the only man in the city who knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything about the machinery they</seg><seg type="columnLine">used:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The servant girl proved to have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest intelligence, fully as developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">128</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as the General. His friendship was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great help. He was the son of the Ruler</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held a very high position. He it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was who suggested that Tom was a god,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was responsible for the comfort he</seg><seg type="columnLine">received as a guest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> FROM THE WINDOWS gardens</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched for a great distance and Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned they were the source of food</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the city. Hundreds of girls toiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them and the crops, although grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing very fast, were very fragile. Ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals grazed in small fields farther away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the distance a wall several hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet high could be seen to inclose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire city and gardens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tom turned to the girl, whose name</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sounded like Zola. "Zola, why is it no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">men are ever at work? I have watched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the girls toiling day after day but have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">never seen a man working. There cer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tainly must be men of your class in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the city who are much better fitted to do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the work than the girls out there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Zola was surprised at the question,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and showed it. "Why! The few men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there are never do any kind of labor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They are kept in every comfort."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "So few men, you say?" Tom asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in surprise. "How does your race con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tinue if there are so many more women</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than men?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There have been very few men left</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alive for hundreds of generations now,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">replied Zola. "The men, unless they are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kept alive for breeding purposes, are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">killed soon after birth. Only those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chosen by the masters to propagate the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">race are let live. History tells that in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the past men were let live but when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they tried to overthrow the masters they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were condemned to death. Since then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only about fifty men are kept alive in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">each generation, to father the children</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of our race."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the look of mixed emotions on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tom's face she continued, "The women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who are to be mothers are chosen, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the only work they have is to raise chil-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dren. There are about five hundred of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them who live with the men. I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chosen but my master had me kept for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">private work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tom was very glad Zola had belonged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the General--whose real name was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Prince Cama. When he reached out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and touched the girl she was trembling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The look of adoration was stronger on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her face than he had ever seen it. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">found her in his arms and was cover-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing her face with kisses before he knew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what he was doing, then, as he let her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">go, tears rolled down her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'll have to leave you now, Tom."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had learned to call him by name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I must give myself up to be done away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with. If I don't and they find that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">care for me I'll be tortured. It will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">much easier if I die now than to wait."</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the first time in his life Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew what it was to completely lose his</seg><seg type="columnLine">temper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You'll what?" he stormed. "You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">do nothing of the kind. I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have something to say about that. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member you belong to me and what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine I take care of. The whole city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Borid can't take you away from me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can wreck it in a few minutes with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short circuit; and before they can take</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, I will!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  While he talked, he paced the floor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the look on his face was stormy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"They may think I'm a god, but if they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">try any funny work they'll find I am</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more than they can deal with."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At the look on Zola's face he swung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">around to face the door and saw Prince</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cama standing there with a look it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">impossible to describe on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well," said Tom, as he realized he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knew, "what are you going to do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After what seemed an age he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. "I'm sorry, Tom"--he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to call him by name as well--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but it is against all the laws of the city</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AST-8</seg><seg type="columnLine">STRANGE CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to have anything to do with one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">servant girls.

"But neither is there</seg><seg type="columnLine">power enough in this city to take her</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from me. I'll wreck every mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing part in your city as weil as cut off</seg><seg type="columnLine">your light the minute you try anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bring on your guard and I'll stack them</seg><seg type="columnLine">up for mince meat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a vain boast but the prince was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken back and didn't question that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do as he said. The color left his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and it turned a sickly white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When Tom saw his advantage he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued. "This may be your city now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I'm taking orders from no man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you don't listen to a little reason every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of you will find yourselves outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls where you came from.

There is only one elevator</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this building in good condition, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others are in bad shape and only two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them still work at all. There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one electric bulb out of fifty that</seg><seg type="columnLine">still burns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know you have had to crowd up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and desert many buildings for the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason. All the equipment has gone bad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it will only be a short time until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the equipments in the others is the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. For generations you have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">no work and have deteriorated to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">race of weaklings.

"I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am only a prince of the city while you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are one of the gods; it is not for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to question and I will do as you say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My father is very proud and stubborn</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I hope that we may still be friends.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Do you intend to rule the city from</seg><seg type="columnLine">now on ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!

"Maybe I've been taking too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for granted, Zola? If I have,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm sorry. Don't think I'll demand</seg><seg type="columnLine">your affection because you're a slave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wouldn't want you that way."</seg><seg type="columnLine">130</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The look she turned toward him told</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more than words as she dropped at his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feet and threw her arms around his legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There was no question of her affection</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for him.

"Please, Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You can't fight the whole palace guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You will have plenty of time to fight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> all you want to, but now we must get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> away from here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "There are plenty of empty buildings</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> where they can't find you in a long time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and I've seen you fix enough of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">machines they brought so I know you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">can make the things work and be com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fortable.

When he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sure she was trying to lift it he reached</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">down with one hand and picked it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The look of consternation on her facc</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">told she had never seen his strength</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">before.

Then she motioned for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> him to enter the space below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    It was pitch-black and for a minute,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as his feet hung in mid-air, he had the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> feeling of falling, but a&lt; he let go the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> floor met him only a few inches away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking up he saw Zola trying to re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> place the stone block from the upper</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> side, leaving herself out of the exit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    He tried calling to her to come down,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  but she only tried the harder to get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  the stone back in place. When he knew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  she wouldn't come he jumped for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  opening and to his amazement bis mus-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  cles carried him back to the floor al&gt;ove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He landed in a heap and as he got to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  feet Zola was again staring at him as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  though he came from another world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">STRANGE CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Although a thousand feet away, he could feel the energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">from each blade--it was beyond imagination!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as the truth of it struck him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't stare at me that way.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only seconds before he tipped the trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">back on edge and slid himself down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone settling back above. It was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a job to hold it with one hand as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got ready to let go, but one final</seg><seg type="columnLine">'push and his fingers were free. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed beside her as the stone slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the groove it had occupied for</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "WHERE ARE YOU, Zola?

He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">two to think of now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had to feel their way along as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no light but, as he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, he felt a bulb overhead that was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken. Searching a minute, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switch and the way was lighted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every hundred feet there was another</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulb and they found they could see from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one light to another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From there, the traveling was faster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While he turned off one light, she turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the one ahead, so they had constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.

He was going to stop and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take out some of the bulbs to carry along</seg><seg type="columnLine">until she assured him they could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty from a storeroom before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached their destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "If we hadn't come this way together</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have tread it alone, seeking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place none of the masters know exist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll show you something very startling</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we have gone much farther.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are many things I have never told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you about my people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They started down such a steep in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cline it was impossible to talk.

Zola laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. That is where we're going,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I'll show you a city the masters</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know is here. It's a city of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. Every once in a while one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slaves disappears and this is their</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven. There are several thousand liv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the building, deserted by the mas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ters long ago and supposed to lie un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We knew where there were plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lights stored and have been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">light the places, but have never had any</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat. The heating plants were burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out generations ago, before the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings were deserted. My people haye</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually increased in number until</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are only about ten times as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the masters in the city as there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "When they started to kill off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men at the time of rebellion a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">many escaped and came here but our</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers have never been strong enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to overcome the masters.

There was no feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of right or wrong between the two. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely a case of who had the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. If the positions were reversed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others would be enslaved and af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forded the same treatment they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves granted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As the light grew plainer Tom could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear voices and at the next turn they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were stopped by guards but recogniz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Zola they bowed down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your highness, we thought you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never come.

"Yes, I am of royal</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood that has been kept in a direct line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although we marry outside of our fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily to keep the blood strong. Our line</seg><seg type="columnLine">STRANGE CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">133</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">has been kept unbroken from the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our capture in our own distant city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The line has come down to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As they entered the building Tom felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little glow of gladness. She was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a child of the breeding rooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> IT WAS not long before they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking upstairs to the upper levels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They traveled down to near the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the building before they approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entry from the passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several times they passed the doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of elevators long since out of order.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hoped to find men who could help</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the repair work. But if they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">as helpless as the masters he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to train them before they could be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they climbed from floor to floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size of the building was apparent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They traveled several hundred feet be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween stairs on some floors, passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of rooms showing signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">usage. A chill in the air told the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort they lived under, while other</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings had warmth and comfort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zola explained that, of the servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls in the city, many would be loyal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their masters and would not help</seg><seg type="columnLine">overthrow them. So they counted with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the servants when they thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own people. Only those showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a decided race feeling were taken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hide-out and then after the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid tests. That was why they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to live within the city without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masters' knowledge for generations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Near the top, the absence of people</seg><seg type="columnLine">became more apparent as vacant apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment after vacant apartment was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind. All worked except the ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">tending the children, and as they came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the glow of the outside world he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw them toiling in the gardens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had changed the roof of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building into a garden spot and spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">their time raising food there. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight from the rest of the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the top stood well above the nearest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings and there was none in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance quite as tall. They were as safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though a thousand miles separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">them from the rest of the city and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">toiled here undetected for a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years or more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The philosophy of the people in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">world was beyond comprehension.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They toiled for a thousand years, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing forward to the time they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">change places with the masters. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">never thought of looking beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside wall to see what the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world was like. They just stayed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A legend of monsters beyond the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so strong they didn't dare attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cross it, but were content to live in</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace. The gods had rescued them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their masters back in the dim ages or</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would have been killed on the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, and the belief of certain death kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">them within the walls of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This building was formerly the palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and everything in it the finest in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city.

Tom decided to investigate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first chance he had. Now his attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taken up while the people gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">around and Zola told them one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods had returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Hours later, having slept, he decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do something about the chill of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. It ate into the marrow of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones. The chill seemed to grow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every hour that passed it went farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it reached the point of numbness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No wonder the people hadn't multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied faster.

But now a god</seg><seg type="columnLine">had returned and was taking them into</seg><seg type="columnLine">forbidden ground to fix some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines. It took a lot of grit to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come the fear they had entertained for</seg><seg type="columnLine">generations, but they didn't hesitate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, filing silently clown the stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fanaticism was pitiful. Genera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions let the machinery in the city stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deteriorate through lack of care.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The builders had instilled the fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching anything, so strongly it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried on as a tradition. If nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was done to repair the damage the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">city would soon be a heap of deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery which only needed a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trip down the runways and stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">took considerable time, and long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reached bottom Tom lost track of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the number of stories. The building</seg><seg type="columnLine">could easily house thousands of people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The city at its height must have had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous number of inhabitants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ravages of disease had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">them like flies at a certain stage, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">prior to bringing in the people who now</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived as masters. The lack of sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gradually weakened the race to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point where they could no longer with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand any hardship, and disease had run</seg><seg type="columnLine">riot amongst them. The present in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitants were doomed the same way</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless some artificial means of creating</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal health could be found in a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doors that were all Tom could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">to force open led to basements far be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low the point where the building was</seg><seg type="columnLine">used. They found subcellars far below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom story. The building was</seg><seg type="columnLine">constructed mainly below ground. At</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">least fifty of the floors were below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface, vet the basements were far l&gt;e-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath these. It was hard to realize the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance down to the entrance of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine room stretching for several hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From ceiling to floor was a solid mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of machinery and Tom knew he had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost impossible task. It would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a month to find the use for even a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of the motors and coils in sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finding only a few of the bulbs could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lighted, he sent two men back for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply. These people were very care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of their stock and showed they</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked ahead farther than the masters</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were content to waste. The rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son for the difference was clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The masters had nothing to look for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to. Every day into the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">future was repetition without change.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no advancement, no possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility of any gain for the race. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of touching any equipment had</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed any possible interest in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city itself. Life was just to be lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the time everything was either</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn out or out of commission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slaves looked forward to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comforts the masters enjoyed and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reversing their positions. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more health among the slaves due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men and women laboring day after</seg><seg type="columnLine">day in the gardens to eke out an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The machinery for cultivation had</seg><seg type="columnLine">long since been discarded and no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make more. A few hand imple-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were still in the use of the mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters but it was one of the greatest lacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the city. There had been no manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">facture of any kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clothing had l&gt;een stored for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of years in warehouses. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply was very short and the slaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only found small quantities in rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjoining the secret passages which</seg><seg type="columnLine">honeycombed the city. Clothes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealously guarded and the use restricted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to appearances in public. None of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">STRANGE CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">135</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">workers who toiled in the fields and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardens wore any. The lack of clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become a standard thing and if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't been for the feeling of reverence</seg><seg type="columnLine">the masters felt for him Tom would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been denied their use in his apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the men returned and the lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">were replaced Tom could see every inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room from a small platform at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one end. An automatic switchboard on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one wall was the only moving thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the feeing of desertion was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> HE felt the first twinge of home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickness and only by supreme effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">could dispel it. There was work to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done and he felt that the channel once</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed from Earth was not to be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed. He had work to do here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be the salvation of this race.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their hope for the return of the race</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had built the city would be real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized through him. He knew enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle most of the equipment, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal was new to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Before turning away from the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form he tried a door in the wall behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. As it opened lights appeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls behind clear partitions simi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar to the walls of the switchboard in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine room. Tiny models of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery stood before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was like a dream to see the minia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture models of the vast machines so</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain. It simplified matters greatly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parts were placed so their re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation to the rest of the machine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very plain. It would mean hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">study instead of weeks to find their use.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hope began to return. The task was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not insurmountable at that. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">repair them in less time than he thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the question of material was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Questioning, he found that a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantity of cable and all types of parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were packed in a room they never en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered but which was of such size it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">might contain the repair parts for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machinery in the city. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long way off and it would be almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to bring any sized part with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out fixing the car which went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he studied the small machines be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him the scheme of things took</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. The equipment was quite sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple. Few moving parts showed, so few</seg><seg type="columnLine">he couldn't at first grasp the meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stationary parts. Then it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came clear! Instead of the usual gears</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wheels he expected, they used mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nets to operate the parts sliding back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forth in grooves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the simplicity took form in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind it was clear why they had run for</seg><seg type="columnLine">generations. Deterioration from stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was so small it would take a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand years for the amount of rust to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather that a year would see on Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each part had a small magnet at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached which tripped the flow of energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">so it always had pull from coils ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the limit of action was reached it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would reverse while it slid back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Twice he reached to feel of some part, -</seg><seg type="columnLine">the models appeared so plain through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the transparent surface. Each time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped as he hit the smooth wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men were dozing when he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out once before returning to the task</seg><seg type="columnLine">of digesting the layout of machinery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the picture took form in his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not a complicated but a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple room that lay before him. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticing a button below the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew was the heating plant, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The coloring of the model changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and certain parts were brought out</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger, tinged a peculiar shade of green.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first Tom closed his eyes to change</seg><seg type="columnLine">the optical illusion but when he opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the model remained the same and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew he looked at a type of tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision. The actual machines were pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On closer examination, the parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">136</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">showed in relief those which ceased to	He believed somewhere there would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">function and the trouble with each part	be a car leading directly to the ware-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear.

The man's legs shook as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tom opened a door in the metal and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beckoned for them to follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A SWITCH inside the door lighted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up every part, and the vast heating coils</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">took his breath away. The amount of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">energy they must burn would tax the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">largest plant on Earth to supply. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">energy source for the city was incon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ceivable, yet somehow it hooked up with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the engjne room he had first seen. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">energy in that room would be sufficient</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to handle these parts, but any smaller</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">machine would hardly handle the lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The heating unit was in good shape</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the parts which had failed proved</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to be in working order. One part had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">frozen to the track due to lack of lubri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cation. The tank which supplied it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drained and the track deeply scored</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where the metal had traveled long after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the lubricant was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When he tried to send one of the men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the storehouse for oil they were so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">afraid he decided to go himself and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bring what was needed while checking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over the parts stored there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Further examination proved that only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cable replacement was necessary to have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the machine working again. The men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with him were exhausted and it was only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through supreme effort they followed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him along the line of cars in the wall,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">searching for the one which would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">carry them for the parts required.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tioned the storehouse. Several were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very puzzling as they had a list of names</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with buttons beside each.

The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cars with more than one name beside</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them were always larger and this tended</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to prove the theory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One of the men discovered another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">car directly below the platform and this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proved to be the one to the supply house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  None of the men had ever been in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one of the cars, they had always lived</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in deserted buildings and not one of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the cars on the upper floors still worked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When they had all entered the car</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with Tom's urging he closed the door</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and waited to start, but nothing hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pened. After several minutes he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">given up all hope when a button on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wall caught his eye. Pressing proved</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to be the key. The car started and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">picked up speed until it tore along at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a terrific rate. He hoped they were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">headed for the right place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The car hadn't been used since the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">race of engineers had gone from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">city, yet was in as perfect condition now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as when it wls built. It would mean</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only a short time until the building</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be functioning again with every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">machine in shape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The car slowed to a halt after sev-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eral minutes and when the door slid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back his eyes wandered over rows of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">material: every type of part from cable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to armature! Complete cars such as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they had just come in were hung sus-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pended from the roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They were operated on the same prin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ciple of magnetism as the other mov-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing parts he had seen and the simplicity</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">showed it wouldn't be hard to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">STRANGE CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">137</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them all working in the building, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">communication resumed.

Heat had the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of putting them to sleep.

It came to a smooth stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the given floor as the door opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them. It was a great thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zola and she tried pushing first one</seg><seg type="columnLine">button and then another to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car go up and down while Tom tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to hide a smile at her childish</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she tired he took the car to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the basement and they came out to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men standing in a group with looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear on their faces but the return of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their princess reassured them. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the number of buttons there were well</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a hundred stories, although he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't count them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the men entered the car to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go he thought of something else and</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to the storehouse for tools for</seg><seg type="columnLine">working the gardens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sent several loads to the basement</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he was satisfied. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor-driven machines with storage bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries for power that could do the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fifty people in a day. He must re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place some of the labor so they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">help in rebuilding, or the food couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">be grown to take care of the people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A unit to hook into a light socket for</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging batteries next caught his eye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a little searching he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">several.

With them you can grow plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of food with few of your people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This reassured her somewhat but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">still worried when he took several peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple to instruct in the use of the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines. It was an arduous task for them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to operate machines they had never seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">before but one man was especially adept.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom spent some time teaching him to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">handle one very well. One man learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take the charger from one machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another and keep the batteries up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">full charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving his prize student to instruct</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others in the use of the machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom went looking for Zola in the gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE PEOPLE were working des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately to straighten out the crops and</seg><seg type="columnLine">harvest those ready to come in. Zola</seg><seg type="columnLine">went everywhere to see they put forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">every effort, though every man, woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and child was laboring against time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape starvation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the most intensive training men</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove the electric tractors and culti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vators into the fields and the work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultivation went forward faster than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole population could carry it before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few hours meant a great deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm to the crops. The fragile plants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the only ones edible. The weeds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of a rope-vine type of growth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">choked out everything. It was a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuous struggle to grow sufficient food</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the people and the lack of care for at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least two work periods was near dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aster. The food shortage could never</seg><seg type="columnLine">be caught up. It meant short rations</seg><seg type="columnLine">for several weeks to get them back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point of sufficient output to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of the needed supply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten tractors were busy before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next rest period and the crops in fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape, although a lot were crushed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wheels rolling over them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crops were saved, but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great loss of quantity. The machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">could put more ground under cultiva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion but the seed would take away a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good portion of the food supply. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked forward to weeks of the slim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mest rations to gather the extra seed</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom started a school when the trac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors had replaced many of the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fields, and before long a crew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanics could tend crudely to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">140</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ASTOUNDING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">machines at work. Then he stopped for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a breathing spell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shortage of food was serious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom tried to find some way of helping</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out, but without result. They had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for the crops to mature seed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow again. The main crops matured</seg><seg type="columnLine">in about thirty rest periods, but that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time to go hungry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He often wondered, as the days</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, whether the Ruler had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">any trace of his escape and whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prince Cama was suspected of warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He had missed Cama, the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend he had made in Borid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AT the first opportunity, he ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the building in the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was only a small door and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">took time to find the way to open it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When it finally gave, he jumped ! One</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand had pressed a stone out of place</seg><seg type="columnLine">accidentally and worked the combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. It swung to the side as he mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veled at the thickness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Metal almost a foot thick, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstand an army. He stepped inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of walls whose thickness was in pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion to the door. Without question</seg><seg type="columnLine">built for refuge in time of attack, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would withstand almost any force. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">builders of the city were obviously not</seg><seg type="columnLine">free from attack when they built the</seg><seg type="columnLine">massive structure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Occupying the whole interior was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge metal object. Longer than high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it resembled the shape of an egg. Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached slowly, not knowing what</seg><seg type="columnLine">to expect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the larger end a panel of clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance shone, but there seemed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other break in the surface. Following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curved side toward the smaller end</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to a door with steps leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the interior. Looking to see where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faint glow of light came from, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered there was no top on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. It was open to the sky but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls reached so high they let in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">only a small part of the outside glow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he went on into the egg there seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no explanation for the lack of roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt along the wall in the pitch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">black as he crept along. His hand en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered a switch and suddenly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior flooded with light as he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It appeared like quarters for men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a bunk along the wall that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">accommodate forty or fifty for sleeping.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tables and small stools were fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor. Every object was fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">down!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Passing through a door toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front, he entered an engine room. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center stood a rotor about twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet across, a miniature model of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one he first saw deep in the Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several small machines stood near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved walls, but all centered at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotor as if it were their guiding force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A slight'movement appeared at the rotor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on closer examination he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blades were turning very slowly; so</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly they had to be watched very close</seg><seg type="columnLine">to detect the change in position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he touched the blades to feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">the movement he jumped back. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a current in them--only equal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary house current but sufficient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure be wouldn't touch them again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was sufficient energy for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights and he knew they must be hooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in some way. Where did the energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from ? There was no outside con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nection with the main building; it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be created within the egg. A great</seg><seg type="columnLine">light dawned on him. The apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was creating it from some force con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained on this planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big rotor he escaped from came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mind. It was the source of energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the entire city and had been un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">failing for thousands of years. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotors gathered energy from the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere in some way. It wasn't created</seg><seg type="columnLine">by them; they were just the gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had evidently tapped the energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">STRANGE CITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">141</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">waves on Earth that compared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those here and the rotor had drawn him</seg><seg type="columnLine">over! The location of this planet was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mystery. It wasn't in the solar sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem as no other heavenly body had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown in the sky since his arrival. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must occupy the same space as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, but in a different dimension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surface of the planet would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">very interesting. What if it had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same oceans as the Earth--the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and mountain ranges? It was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier to understand being pulled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one dimension to another than to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being carried through space to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet so distant there was no sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earth's planets or Sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the front of the room, toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big end of the egg, a circular stairway</seg><seg type="columnLine">led upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The floor above the first level only</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his eye for a fleeting look. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched the full length of the ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every few feet a tube was turned up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air, as if to be lowered through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the egg where sealed portholes</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THE NEXT FLOOR was quite dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent and the room he came into had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clear plate in front. He could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outside, and, by getting his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">close and peering down, could just catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the small door in the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were switches on the wall near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stair and the room leaped into bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. The lights controlled from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch downstairs were only a skeleton</seg><seg type="columnLine">system. They were just guiding lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach other parts of the egg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A flat board in front drew his atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and, examining it, the feeling it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the instrument on some type of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship became a certainty. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dials strangely like a compass but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">more points while-some seemed to point</seg><seg type="columnLine">out certain names as though pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spots on the planet--and he won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half a dozen small levers looked like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">controls. Moving one he jumped back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hum began to come up through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shaft from the engine room and run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to a cabinet at the side lie threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a switch.

He pulled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever to take it up or there might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been quite a smash, but that offset the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall enough to stop more than a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">bump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom left the ship after turning off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights with a feeling he was lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be stranded somewhere in the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">above Borid to drift with the elements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship wasn't injured as there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">springs on the bottom to take the shock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He determined to train some men. as</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew, at the first opportunity and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explore the surrounding territory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside the door in the wall was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabinet he had not seen before.

Replacing it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his finger touched a button on the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a heavy shock similar to a gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Looking up where the end of the rod</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been pointed a hole appeared in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone of the wall about two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet overhead.

After</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying one of the other guns he took it</seg><seg type="columnLine">along and carried several new charges</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. So far he had no need for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a weapon but he never knew.

It would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to make them sec, but it could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done and he intended to do it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">question was how?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men he trained as mechanics</seg><seg type="columnLine">were much slower than the women who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lived amongst mechanical equipment</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good share of their lives.

What</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the meaning, Tom?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His look was pleading and Tom had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They walked through the halls to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment Cama was to occupy before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told a great deal about the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation of the city.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have been when I brought you</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, but you have been here long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to understand what I want.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have seen for yourself what</seg><seg type="columnLine">work does for people when they know</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are accomplishing something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are interested in everything I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing. They have far more comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">than your own people who hold them</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves. I've given them many advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tages that you lack and I want to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same for your people. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one requirement I must make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There are to be no more slaves.

These</seg><seg type="columnLine">people have a great deal to offer you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you have not in exchange. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be their protection from your</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater numbers. I will open up com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munication between all the buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and will put mechanics to work on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings you occupy to restore the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can have tools to work your</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields that will do the work of fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.

You have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing for so long it will be hard for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your people to take up the work when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slaves leave, but they will help you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It will not be long before you will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad of the exchange you have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the advantages you receive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time Cama sat with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in his hands and said nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Tom watched. It was a long step</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a ruler to take and the decision was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great import. The moment spelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">life for all future generations. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be no turning back. The change</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be permanent--intermarriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">would so knit the two peoples.

The one he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the September number was rotten. Iu the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first place, it looked like a steamship poster, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded one unpleasantly of a map. The color</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hard and disagreeable, the subject mailer</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no attraction, and the general composition</seg><seg type="columnLine">was crude. There really was no composition, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak of. In fact, it had no appeal to one's</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity or aesthetic sense, either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cover on the October number was par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly good l'or its colors. They were har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monious and pleasing. The greens and warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">blues fitted in well with the more intense yellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reds of the letterhead. Perhaps you editors</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't realize it, but the actual artistic attraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a cover. Its pleasing of the eye alone, has a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great deal to do with the selling powers of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine. Naturally you do realize it, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way I mean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cover has to do more than startle the public.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And perhaps you are not entirely aware of It.</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the public taste in artistic matters is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderably better than It was ten years ago. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist probably knows what good illustration is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Give him free rein, and see how it turns out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let him pick his own story and illustrate it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way he thinks most fitting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This business of trying to give the public ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly what it says it wants is no bed of roses--</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it doesn't exactly know. It knows what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it likes when it sees it. but it is unable to sav</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly, in a great many ca«es.

Also it lucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">plausibility.
