The work of the chemist</seg><seg type="columnLine">can hardly be called work at all. It is the keenest and most enjoyable</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of pleasure.

They are done--today and every day--not on</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert islands, but in the chemical laboratories throughout your own coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. Quietly, systematically, the chemist works. His work is difficult, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">more adventurous than the blood-curdling deeds of the Spanish Main.

Herman Frasch, who showed how to extract sulphur, built</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a huge fortune. C. M.

As a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, many people who read such stories are prone to vent</seg><seg type="columnLine">their exasperations--and frequently in no uncertain manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other hand, I maintain that the average fiction writer</seg><seg type="columnLine">now seems entirely too tame and will have to draw a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal more on his imagination if he is to keep going. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproach of the present day fiction writer ten years hence prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably will be ridicule, not because he overshot the mark, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather because he undershot it considerably. And so our present</seg><seg type="columnLine">day reader snorts with disgust at the once incredible exploita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, written years ago. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">then science and progress have caught up with both Wells</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Verne to an astonishing degree; what was audacious fiction</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, is so much a reality today, that some of their writings</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer make good reading, but actually sound commonplace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many writers in the past have written about the queer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so-called "impossible" effects to be had with future unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays and unknown waves, but none of these authors probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">was prepared to write of the "absurdities" which now have</seg><seg type="columnLine">become facts. In a current issue of Radio News, there will</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found an article entitled "High-Frequency Magic in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radio Laboratory." These astounding experiments were made</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently by no less than the research scientists of the General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Electric Company at Schenectady. A new vacuum tube has</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it possible, for the first time, to combine ultra-high fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quencies with high power, hitherto available only for the longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavelengths. The new tube works on 50,000 kilocycles (6</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters), with a power of 15 kilowatts and when the tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">begins to operate, the following are the altogether astounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that happen:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men who work near the apparatus immediately notice a</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct warming effect, although nothing touches them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">human temperature is increased to nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit</seg><seg type="columnLine">•in about fifteen minutes; the experiments were discontinued</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the body heat reached that temperature. Mind you, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room temperature stayed the same--the air was not heated. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sausage was placed in a glass tube, hung from the end of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">receiving aerial and in a few minutes the sausage started</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming, showing that it was being cooked. Yet no metal ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">torched it. With a similar arrangement, cookies have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">baked and water boiled, without any metal near them. An apple</seg><seg type="columnLine">was baked from the inside out, without any perceptible heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bake it. As a- matter of fact, there was no heat around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire of the aerial itself. An incandescent lamp pulled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its shipping carton the first time lighted to its full brilliancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">without wires or a socket touching it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stranger yet, a copper bar lying on the floor heat-blistered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand that picked it up, although the metal was--and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained--cold. In other words, you actually do burn your</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers from a cold metal, which is at room- temperature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   A neon tube, suspended in the room, without anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching it, lights Tip to its brilliant characteristic red glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely when someone touches it with his hand. Electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters in adjoining rooms run wild and electrical instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a distance are twisted or broken, making all scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">measuring work in the vicinity of the operating tube impossible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, then, we have, in a small way, the beginning of a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendously important art and even the scientists who performed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the experiments are loath to predict to what actual use the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new power tube may be put. Evidently, we have not as yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratched the surface of this particular subject. There is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt in anyone's mind, who witnessed these important experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, that power by radio is already here and while the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginnings are modest, no one dares to foretell its possibilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">five or ten years hence, because the wildest expectations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">today will no doubt be exceedingly tame a few years hence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only three short years ago, in the December, 1925, issue</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Radio News, I wrote an editorial entitled "Power by Wire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less" and I remember a number of letters from scientists and</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineers who wrote me some rather uncomplimentary letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointed out to me, that the tilings which I had said were</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible and would never come about. Yet, they are here</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and in a way have exceeded my predictions of that time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To be sure, what we do in the laboratory is not immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">done on a large and practical scale, but it is usually found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">what can be accomplished in the laboratory sooner or later</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be done on a large scale after more is known and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been learned in the art. That was the case with radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, when Hertz made his original experiment; it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case with the telephone; it was the case with the electric light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was the case with the dynamo which furnishes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and with many others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^ Mr. Hugo Gernsback speaks every Tuesday at 9.30 P.

He got the cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomer on the phone and told him his policy had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in the basket. The next morning, the owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his safe deposit box and found it absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. Approximately twenty thousand dollars worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bonds had been removed from the box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Within the next few days several other renters re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported thefts aggregating about half a million dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We were called into the case at the very outset, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were able to get a complete record of everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had happened to date.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At first it looked like an inside job.

When you rent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, you get two keys which are duplicates and are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only ones in existence that will open your box. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the company that installed the vault is not able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a third key that will fit your lock. If you lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">one key, you can have a duplicate made from the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, but if both keys become lost at the same time, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only way to open your box is to force the door, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a long hard job.

He continued thus:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The method used by the bank employee in Los</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angeles was so simple that it's funny no one ever had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of it before.

When, as it frequently happened, the vault was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unoccupied while one of these customers was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his papers, the bank attendant would remove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the customer's key, make a wax impression of it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly put it back in the lock again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From this wax impression he would file out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">duplicate key, and the next time he was alone in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vault, he would open the patron's box and rifle it of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its contents, after which he would lock it. In this way</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lifted about a hundred thousand dollars worth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds, but we set a trap for him and finally landed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in jail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A confidential report of this case was sent to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">president of every bank in the country and practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of them adopted the rule of requiring all customers</seg><seg type="columnLine">who left the vault to take their keys with them. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">rule was being enforced in the Milwaukee bank at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the big robbery took place there, so the wax</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression scheme could hardly have been used. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other thing that made us give up the idea that this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inside job was the fact that the only person who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a position to pull anything of this sort was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had reported finding the insurance policy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naturally, if he were a thief, he would have known</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than to throw the policy in the waste-basket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if he had been such a dumb-bell, he certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have reported it to the bank officials.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "At that, we put the poor guy through the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree and checked up on his private life and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of money he had been spending, but we couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get anything on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Just about this time, five other banks--four in Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cago and one in Detroit--reported similar robberies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we knew at once that the jobs were being pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the outside and that we had to deal with one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cleverest and most dangerous crooks that ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But surely, you don't suspect me!"

One reason why I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't is that neither of these objects comes anywhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">near being like a line, which would have neither width</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor thickness, but only length. However. I can draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a picture showing what a cube would look like if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were extended into four dimensions. Mathematicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">call such an object a tesseract or hyper-cube. It is what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd get if you moved a cube having a volume of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">cubic inch for a distance of one inch in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fourth dimension. And while I'm about it, I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">illustrate my point still further by drawing a picture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a three-dimensional transparent glass cube, as it looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a point directly above it." I picked up a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper and drew these two sketches:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">_</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Three Dimensional Glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cube as seen from directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course you understand that this is drawn in</seg><seg type="columnLine">perspective and for that reason it looks somewhat dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted to anyone who is not accustomed to looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">four-dimensional objects. To get the idea, you'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use your imagination. The small cube in the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">is really exactly the same size as the outer cube. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat similar to the effect you get when you look</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight down on a three-dimensional cube made out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent glass. W'hat you seem to see is a square</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a smaller square inside it, and with the corners</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two squares connected with diagonal lines. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know perfectly well that in reality both of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">square faces are equal in size and the four lines which</seg><seg type="columnLine">look diagonal are really perpendicular.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You also know that the four figures grouped around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center square, which look like trapezoids, are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">actuality squares.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's exactly the same sort of effect you get from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of a tesseract.

These</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines form the edges of four more cubes, exactly equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">in size to each of the other two cubes and grouped</seg><seg type="columnLine">around or through them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you'll count the various parts of the tesseract,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll see that it is bounded by six cubes, twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">square faces, thirty-two edges and sixteen corners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simple enough, isn't it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Simple as mud," grunted Clancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You follow me, don't you, Mr. Dern?"

As soon as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">established with reasonable likelihood, that the criminal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rifling the safe deposit boxes by means of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hyper-Forceps, it was easy to figure out just how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would operate. His first move would be to rent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">box for himself, since that would be the only way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get inside the vault. He would make frequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">visits to the vault until he happened to strike a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he was all alone. Then, with the aid of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hyper-Forceps, he would remove the contents of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four boxes, putting the bonds and other valuables</seg><seg type="columnLine">which could easily be converted into cash, into his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, and carrying the worthless papers away in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket. On his first robbery he had made the mistake</seg><seg type="columnLine">of throwing an insurance policy into the waste basket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This error was never repeated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since we knew that our quarry was numbered among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the renters of safe deposit boxes in the various banks</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been robbed, the next logical step was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtain from these banks copies of all new signature</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards which had been made out between the last time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had seen the Hyper-Forceps and the date the rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bery was discovered in each bank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">108</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From this assortment of signatures, it didn't take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a handwriting expert long to pick out the cards which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been signed by the same person.

One thing that helped us most</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that the robber, for obvious reasons, had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">rented one of the largest boxes available, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently unusual to attract attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't long before we picked up a hot scent.

Evidently he had become so</seg><seg type="columnLine">careless and cocksure that he would never be discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered, that he had even used the same alias as on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the previous robberies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without waiting even to pack a grip, Clancy and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarded an airplane which had been kept in readiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">for just such a call, and hopped off to the land of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Latter Day Saints.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We landed at Woodward Field at about two o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the afternoon and immediately went to the bank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upon presenting our credentials, we secured permis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion to keep the vault open after the regular business</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours. Under Clancy's direction, two workmen made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few changes in the scenery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He selected one of the small private booths, located</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost directly opposite the entrance of the vault, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had two concealed peep holes put in the door. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">further end of the vault there were already two large</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirrors. Clancy instructed the workmen to install four</seg><seg type="columnLine">more mirrors on the portions of the walls not occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the doors of safe deposit compartments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When this was done he went into the "doctored"</seg><seg type="columnLine">booth and looked through each of the peep holes, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I moved from one part of the vault to another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O.

This was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be our signal that the suspected person was about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter the vault.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as the bank opened on the following morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, Clancy and I took our positions inside the booth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was not until about fifteen minutes before clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing time that the little light flashed on.

After going through the cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomary routine of inserting each of the two keys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening the door and drawing the tin box part way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the compartment, the bank attendant withdrew</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left Mr. Suspect alone in the vault.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took his box to the table in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vault and pretended to examine a few papers. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">reality he was stealthily looking around to see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone else was at the counter preparing to enter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vault. Apparently satisfied that he would not be inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted, he picked up his box and carried it to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It happened to be in a front corner, out of sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anyone standing in front of the vault's entrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we could easily see his reflection in one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirrors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Placing his box on the floor, he reached in his breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket and drew forth a peculiar-looking article resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling a physician's forceps with two sets of handles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Hyper-Forceps!" I. whispered to Clancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sle nodded to indicate that he had understood me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH both hands, the man manipulated the han-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dles of the instrument until the jaws seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">melt right into the thick steel walls of the vault.

I whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, but I won't need it with this bird." It turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out that his boast was a bit premature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without making a sound, we opened the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiptoed into the vault, just as the thief was removing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second box from its compartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clancy laid his hand on the crook's shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronounced the conventional formula: "You're under</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Hyper-Forceps, together with the safe deposit</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, clattered to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the quickness of a rattlesnake, the criminal</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached back and grasped Clancy's neck between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasped hands, at the same time bending forward in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a way that he heaved the detective's body over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and threw him to the floor of the vault.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clancy passed out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the thug turned to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before I could make a move to defend myself, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealt me a terrific blow in the pit of my stomach.

"Check me if I go wrong. Diouma-Mbobo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and about a dozen of the Senegalese have dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared mysteriously. So did the sailor Ferentini on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat that brought me here. In no case was any trace</seg><seg type="columnLine">found of the man after he disappeared, and in the cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the island when anything was found it was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">a knife or a rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I his report," he ruffled the papers, "from one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senegalese, says that he saw his companion jerked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a tree by a huge black rope, but when he rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the tree he could see nothing. It was late in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening. Now this account agrees singularly with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sailor Dugasse--and moreover, if natives were</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for the disappearances, they would at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken the knives, if not the guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Iherefore, I consider that the disappearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ferentini, the Senegalese and the natives was due to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same agency, and that the agency was not human;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, therefore, I think the Tanosy and the sailor Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasse, although he is still in jail, should be acquitted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duperret nodded a grave assent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I am sure it was nothing supernatural. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">something on that boat, Duperret, and the Senegalese</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw something. Moreover, there is Dugasse's knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have analyzed that liquid which dripped from it; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is blood, indubitably, but blood different from any I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ever seen. It contains a tremendous number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpuscles of a new character, not red, but greenish</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow, and the liquid in which they float is similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of all other bloods. More than anything, it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembles the blood of an oyster, which is impossible, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">oysters do not lift men into trees. Therefore, I accuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">some hitherto unknown animal of these deaths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what kind of an animal are we dealing with?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weyl went on without paying any attention to an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terruption from Duperret. "Evidently a very swift and</seg><seg type="columnLine">formidable one. It killed Ferentini in a few seconds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It dragged a powerful Senegalese, who was provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a rifle, off with equal swiftness,'and the stabs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugasse were as futile against it as the rifle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other black boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In both cases, the attack came from above, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am inclined to think, since we were attacked some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance off the coast and the natives some distance inland,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the animal possesses extraordinary mobility--prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably wings.

The post-mortem of that lamentably</seg><seg type="columnLine">deceased visitor on the Morgana's deck ought to tell us</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of his weak points. Do you want to go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there now ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With chairs tilted back against the cabin of the Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gana, the three men regarded the sundown sky in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moody and depressed silence. Their dissection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">octopus killed by Mujgrave's pump-gun had added little</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their knowledge of the anatomy of the menacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutes, save a confirmation of Weyl's hypothesis that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their breathing, while on land, was conducted by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the same gills which supplied them with oxygen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water, protected, like the lobster's, by a covering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chitin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mulgrave's chair scraped on the deck. "Well, let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">get back ashore," he said. "Can't do any more now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancy, unless they decide to stage a party for us this</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It comes down to this, then," said Weyl, continuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conversation which had been abandoned with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of their anatomical researches. "Fire, or some kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of guns heavier than the ordinary service rifle, are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only things that will do any particular good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you thought of gas, my friend?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duperret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Huh," answered Weyl shortly. "Airplanes? Chemi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cals? And what about all the men on the island--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should have to cover it all with gas to be of any use."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The time is rather short, too, I fancy," chirped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mulgrave. "How long will provisions last?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not long," agreed Duperret, moodily. "A week, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a little more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, within seven days, or at the most ten, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE OCTOPUS CYCLE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">119</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">must concoct a plan and put it into force--a plan that</seg><seg type="columnLine">will wipe out God knows how many of these unearthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies of the earth. It must be extermination, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for if one pair were left to breed . . . I'm more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">half convinced that the thing is hopeless. Yet I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to show the white flag. These are, after all, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts. Super-beasts, it is true, but the equals and heirs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of man? I hate to believe it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But, my friend, you forget the force of mere num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers," said Duperret. "So many rats could easily over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">power us, guns and all, from mere lack of time to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as fast as they came on. Comparative values, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">of man and beast, are insignificant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. Weyl nodded a pessimistic agreement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's only one chance," he said. "If we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find some way to attack them in the water--they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">go there to breed at least, and I fancy they must make</seg><seg type="columnLine">periodic visits to the water to wet their gill plumes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">addition."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T was three days later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Another octopus attack on the little fort had</seg><seg type="columnLine">met with a bloody repulse, and a score of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies lay at the edge of the jungle in varying stages</seg><seg type="columnLine">of decomposition, where they had been blown to extinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion by the swift shells of the seventy-fives. A con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference was in progress on Major Larivet's verandah;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a conference of beaten men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "As a last resort," Duperret was saying, "there is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open sea and Mulgrave's yacht."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, as for that," Weyl answered, "it wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold a tenth of us, even crowded to the rails. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave those natives behind? Damn it, they trust us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It would hardly be cricket," said Mulgrave. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mail steamer ? Aren't they apt to send someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look us up when she does not appear ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">i "Not even yet is the boat due at Andovoranto," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Major Larivet, "and there is the time for the news to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach Andananarivo . . . The lack of news to them will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be but a token that we have pacified the Tanosy and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in need of nothing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Duperret agreed, "I know these officials.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are aware of something unusual only when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seventeen dossiers, each neatly tied in red tape</seg><seg type="columnLine">and endorsed by the proper department head. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends, we are alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 "Which means," Weyl continued, "that we have about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week more to live before the food runs out or they</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelm us. And then--good-by world of men!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a little silence, broken only by the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mulgrave puffing at his pipe. It was ended by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot and a shout from one of the sentries at the western</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the fort; the signal of another attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  During that night the great octopuses twice fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way down to the fort, and twice were repulsed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the second effort, longer and more violently sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained than the first, only ended when Mulgrave, called</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the crew of his yacht and their flammenwerfer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As the following day drew on, the unrest in the jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the army post became more pronounced. Major</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larivet, Duperret, and Weyl, worn with lack of sleep,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">kept vigil by the little counterscarp, listening to the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerable whistlings and rustlings so near to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the soldiers and natives, visibly shaken, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult to keep in line.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When evening came, it seemed as though the octo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">puses had concentrated their forces for a great drive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whistlings had increased to such a volume that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep was nearly impossible, and as soon as the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down, the movements of dark forms could be ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served where the animals were silhouetted against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky along the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first attack came half an hour later. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sporadic outburst, apparently, consisting of only three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four individuals, and these were quickly dispersed</seg><seg type="columnLine">or slain by a few bursts from the seventy-fives. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was followed by another, and another, the numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the attackers ranging all the way from three to fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">or twenty. Unlike the previous attempts on the fort</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were fren/.ied and unorganized as though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">directing intelligence behind them had suddenly failed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Immune to fear, the living octopuses came right on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the hail c5f fire and died at the foot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rampart, or dashed over it even, to be wounded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death by bayonets fixed on long poles with which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black soldiers reached and stabbed frenziedly at eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and softer parts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once, during a lull in the combat, the commandant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Weyl were called to witness a monstrous duel, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very edge of the fort between two of the hideous</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts. The ungainly creatures locked in each others'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacles, rolled hideously together, tearing at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other with their great beaks, till a Senegalese reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">over with one of those improvised bayonet pikes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealt first one and then the other mortal stabs. Weyl</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a singular sensation of nausea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward dawn it became evident to the exhausted</seg><seg type="columnLine">artillerymen and their wearied leaders that the octopuses</seg><seg type="columnLine">were now aiming not so much at conquest, as at escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They no longer blundered into the fires that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">built about the fort and village; no longer hurled them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves upon Mulgrave's crew of flame-throwers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shells of the seventy-fives. They seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading for the beach, to be striving to reach the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when dawn broke, the men in the enclosure</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a few stragglers from the hideous army at the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jungle, making their way, like the others, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ungainly flappings and swishings, always toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach. It was impossible to watch them without feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing an almost physical sensation of illness, of sinking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what did it mean ?

Aro Brittlestone came through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■	of my inner office I had the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bull charging in at me. Brit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an inch or two above six feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">t, big boned, and big framed. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeleton would have delighted the eye of a bone special-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ist, or so I imagined from the outer appearance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. This structure carried a maximum of flesh, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minimum of fat. He weighed over two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds, all solid, hard bone and muscle. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crudely constructed man from his huge feet to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarse, black hair, and there was a common strain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that had been but thinly concealed by his educa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, his advent to a society that was above him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the better environment that success had given him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had acquired by hard work and driving ambition</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ease of manner and a pseudo-refinement that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">really to his credit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had never met Brittlestone until the day he entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">my office, coming without appointment, pushing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way in past the attendant and a whole roomful of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">patients. But I had heard of him long before, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sanatorium in the Mendalato Mountains had gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">some fame, a fame that had never waned, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was even now steadily increasing. He himself seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a quite skillful physician, and the many who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come under his care were only too ready to speak a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good word for the sanatorium. He catered to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely wealthy, I understood, but he kept a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain number of charity cases always, some ten or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty. In the six years that his sanatorium had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in existence, he had, I imagine, put away quite a sum; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintained a place in so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciety, a place he had carved</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for himself by sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">force and lavish expendi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. Pie was known in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle, I believe, as gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous to prodigality. Yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never saw a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked so avidly on money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning I met him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he loomed so huge in the doorway, had promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a particularly busy one for me. I glanced up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">annoyance at his abrupt entrance, but Brittlestone ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently failed to notice my attitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Strang?" he asked heartily, his thick lips parted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a smile. He came to a pause, close before me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed down from his commanding height with cordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ality in his small eyes. "I'm Brittlestone of Happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lane in the Mendalatoes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Content that this was introduction enough, and evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently certain that his name was a familiar one to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me, he thrust forth a hand that much grooming had</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to make attractive. After a moment of hesita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, I shook hands with him, invited him to be seated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and waited questioningly and none too cordially to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn his mission. Pie dropped into the chair, crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs, and puffed once on his huge, black cigar. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the only time that I ever saw him without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloak of cultivated, watchful dignity that had almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a part of him. Perhaps his lapse into a coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-sufficiency on our first meeting tinged my whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion of him, and overshadowed later impressions</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would have been more pleasant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine spring we're having, isn't it?" he remarked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently in no hurry to state his object, and uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious that he was taking up time that I could better</seg><seg type="columnLine">have devoted to my practice. Thereafter he rambled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on casually upon unimportant subjects until I was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an excellent murder mood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was a fascination about the man that almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">reconciled me to the lost time, and prevented my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brusquely terminating the interview. The ruggedness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, his huge bulk, and the stark coarseness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">every feature made a striking ensemble, with the veneer</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had acquired. I noted particularly his very</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar eyes. They were almost hidden by huge under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lids, until they gazed from small slits that scarcely re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed the deadness of the iris, and the lacklustre light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pupil. His carefully trimmed, black Vandyke</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard was thin so that the outlines of his chin showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brittlestone, as he talked along, was studying me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. I had the feeling that from their flesh burrows</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">those dull-lit eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching out, taking every</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression of me, and stor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them away in an alert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">active brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether impressed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my impatience, or rebuffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by my monosyllabic replies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brittlestone presently lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ease of manner, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came obviously embarrassed. Abruptly he rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, doctor, I'm afraid I've taken up too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your valuable time, and I humbly apologize, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I started up here to see you, I had a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposition in mind." He hesitated. "It--well, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">really was nothing vital, and hardly warranted'my</seg><seg type="columnLine">intrusion. Something I shall broach to you at another</seg><seg type="columnLine">time perhaps. Perhaps I'll be in, and see you some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time again soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do so," I replied, shaking his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood hesitantly a moment, seemed about to add</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Z_T ERE is another story by Samuel M.

Then other matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept away speculation on the incident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came to my mind several days later, when I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">called upon to treat one of my oldest, and certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealthiest, patients, James Hart, the packer. Mr</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hart had, for the past year, been suffering from digest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ive disorders, and I had repeatedly advised him to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a sanatorium, but without effect. He had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been inclined to accept advice. Indeed, he had forged</seg><seg type="columnLine">through to his great monetary success on his quality</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flouting it. But whereas in the financial world he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been rewarded for his independence, in this case</seg><seg type="columnLine">he paid dearly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1HAD a call from the Hart home. I found Hart</seg><seg type="columnLine">in bed, his face rather anemic, his eyes droopy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He smiled up at me feebly, and there was a despondent</seg><seg type="columnLine">note to his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although Hart's social sphere was removed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine by some millions of dollars, we were close friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had been since the years-ago time when I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a student of medicine, and he had earned his living as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clerk in the packing house he now owned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Tom," he said. "It's got me down good this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Same old trouble. I'm afraid the Lord didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me a very good stomach."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not at all," I returned severely. "Your stomach's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right, or would be if you gave it any chance at all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You wouldn't have had this attack, if you had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">my advice. Your whole system needs toning up, Jim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A couple of months at a sanatorium would set you up</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fit as a fiddle. All you need are regular hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular meals, and a proper diet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And if I don't go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, if you don't go--I'm afraid you'll be a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick man, Jim."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He considered a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what Doc Brittlestone said," he returned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was talking to him yesterday. He told me he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friend of yours, Tom. Fine man, isn't he? I only</seg><seg type="columnLine">met him a week ago, but we're good friends already.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Met him out at the Benvo Club. He's an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">golf player.

He agrees that unless I go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sanatorium, I'll be in bad shape. He suggested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I come to his place. That's one reason I called you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom. I wanted you to take another look at me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you still thought I needed the treatment, T wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask you what you think of Brittlestone's sanatorium."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"To the best of my knowledge, it is all right, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to go there," I replied, a trifle stiffly. "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">never heard anything against it, and I have heard some</seg><seg type="columnLine">good reports upon it. You know, Jim--I've named it</seg><seg type="columnLine">often enough--that I always advise East Lake Sana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torium. I've recommended it for years, and have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a complaint on it. I know that it is excellent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every respect. I still advise it to you, Jim. But if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you prefer Dr. Brittlestone's, why, as I said, I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing against it. But the main thing, man, is to go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to one of them immediately. I'll guarantee that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of months will work wonders with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hart shifted his position, and laid his head back</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearily on his pillow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'll sleep on it. In the morning, I'll make</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangements to go to one of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Content with this promise, I left. I was somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">chagrined at Hart's having accepted the services of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another physician, even though it had been only in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"friendly" way. While he naturally had the right to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain all the medical advice he wished, and to go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">any sanatorium he desired, still my long connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him as family physician and friend gave me, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt, a right to more consideration than I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown. I might, at least, have been apprised before-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward Brittlestone I felt an increasing dislike. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, in a way, abruptly shouldered me aside, and taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">a case away under the artifice of a friendly call. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt that he had deliberately cultivated Hart's</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquaintance for the purpose of obtaining another</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealthy patient for his sanatorium. I remembered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange call upon me, and wondered what connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might have with Hart. Possibly Brittlestone had</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to broach the subject of sending Hart to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own sanatorium, but had felt at a loss how to open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter with me. I felt quite bitter toward Brittle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, and vastly displeased with Hart, as I drove back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning I received a message from Hart</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying that he had decided upon Happy Lane Sana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torium, and would leave town that afternoon. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">displeasure I felt at his choice was displaced by satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction that he had at last been prevailed upon to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper treatment. After all, Happy Lane Sanatorium</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fully as good as East Lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the following several months I received regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters from him, each cheerier than the one preceding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Four months after he had entered Happy Lane, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">received the following:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dear Tom:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    I thought I would drop you a line to let you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> know that I shall be back in the city in two weeks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at most. I am feeling better than I have for ten</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> years. It is all due to Dr. Brittlestone. He is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> really a wonderful physician, Tom. And he is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a wonderful man in every way. His kindness is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> unbounded. He has twenty charity patients here,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and he attends them all personally. He seems</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> more interested in them than in the paying pa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tients even. His ambition is to turn Happy Lane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> entirely into a charitable institution, and he intends</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to do so as soon as he has money enough. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> he may build another place for paying cases. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> is a dreamer and idealist of the highest type, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a wonderful man in every way. Besides my grati-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tude to him for saving me--and he assures me I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> would have been dead in a few months--I admire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> him and like him for his noble qualities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    The sanatorium is situated in a paradise. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  scenery itself is an incentive to health and happi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ness.

BRITTLESTONE'S METHOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a long rambling letter, with a care-free note</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was remarkable in Hart. He described his activi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties with a zest and buoyancy that made me think</seg><seg type="columnLine">longingly of vacation. He had been hunting and fish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and swimming during the past week. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been on long tramps in the mountains. He was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">complaining about the food. Brittlestone would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">allow him enough, he said, and he was always hungry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His letter was filled with such things, but the excerpt</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have quoted was that which most interested me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt no enthusiasm at his eulogy of Brittlestone. W hile</seg><seg type="columnLine">my aversion may have been due in some degree to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessional jealousy, I like to think that it was divination</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my part of his true character. Whatever the cause,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I read that paragraph of Hart's letter with distinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">displeasure. Evidently, Brittlestone had over-empha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized the seriousness of Hart's condition, and played</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the hypochondriac instinct that is in all of us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Certainly he had not saved the millionaire's life. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to see why Brittlestone's patients were so loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">in "praise of the sanatorium. Brittlestone appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me more and more as a wiley money grabber, and pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly even a quack and scoundrel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1WAS totally unprepared for the shock of the letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">I received ten days later:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dear Tom:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Probably you expected me to be home by this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  time. But I have suffered a setback in health.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The day before yesterday when I rose, I felt very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  tired, although I had had a good night's sleep. All</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  that day I felt as tired as though I had been with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  out sleep for a week. Yesterday I felt worse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  fatigued than ever, so much so that I refused to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  get tip. I slept all day, and night--steadily, only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  waking once or twice--but this morning I am no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  better. It is nothing serious according to Dr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Brittlestone. He says that I have auto-intoxication</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  from wrong eating. But I have eaten only the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  prescribed diet. I am worried over my condition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I would like to have you come up, and give your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  opinion, as I think Dr. Brittlestone is mistaken in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  his diagnosis, and that I may be taking some viru-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  lent disease. Are these the symptoms of sleeping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  sickness? I wish you would come right up. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  suggested this to Dr. Brittlestone, and he prom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ised to notify you by letter, as the telephone here</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  is out of order. But I thought I would write you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  myself to be sure you would come. I am having</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Brand mail this, as Dr. Brittlestone has forbidden</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  my writing any letters or receiving visitors for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  next few days. He fears that any excitement or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  exertion would lie harmful. I hope you will come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  up, Tom, as soon as you can get started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                          Hart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Hart's letter alarmed me greatly. Such a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">lassitude is often the prodrome of some serious dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease. At Brittlestone's diagnosis I scoffed. At best</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was no tribute to the efficiency of his institution. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">started immediately for Happy Lane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It is a good sixty mile drive, and I was the better</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the day reaching the little mountain town of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harkinville. Then a two hour climb up a winding can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon road brought me to Happy Lane Sanatorium, huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">towering, and white, with great green lawns, and many</seg><seg type="columnLine">white out-buildings. Enclosing the extensive grounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a high and ornate iron fence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Within, the building was entirely of white tile, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacious, gleaming halls that carried the very atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere of sanitation. But, as in all things Brittlestone</seg><seg type="columnLine">did, this whiteness was more an appeal to impression-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability than a factor toward health. White is known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a harsh effect on the convalescent system. Much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more beneficial is some restful color, preferably one</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked by the patient. The office was magnificently but</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastefully furnished, with really beautiful tapestries and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rugs. Behind a mahogany desk sat a tall, lean, remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably hard-faced woman. She glanced up at my en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance, and gave me a searching look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I approached the desk, she informed me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter finality that visitors were allowed only upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thursdays. Then she returned to her work. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">reception incensed 'me greatly, inasmuch as she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet learned my object in calling, and since my medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cine case must have told her that I was a physician.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This is a professional visit," I said with severity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have a patient here, and have received a hurry call."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, that is different," she returned. She paused.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Whom do you wish to see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Mr. Hart. Will you kindly direct me to his room?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You will have to see Dr. Brittlestone first. He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his laboratory, Room 105. I will show you to it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">At that moment, Brittlestone appeared in the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Upon seeing me, he started slightly, and a fleet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing look of what might have been alarm, or annoyance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed his face. Then he advanced smilingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, doctor," he said. "This is indeed a surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had hardly expected you so soon. You received my</seg><seg type="columnLine">message, then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Recalling that Hart had sent his letter surreptitiously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Naturally I came at once. Have you any</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory as to the cause of Mr. Hart's relapse?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brittlestone seemed nonplussed for a moment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied me sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must confess, no," he returned slowly. "How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, I think collapse would be the better word. Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hart seems to be suffering from an excessive lassitude.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course, I suspected immediately that he had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an acute attack of indigestion, and later I feared he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have developed some malignant disease. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have given him a thorough examination, and can say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he is perfectly sound. So I am forced to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he is suffering from over-exertion. He did rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">overdo it, too, doctor. Against my advice, you may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. The first day he rose from bed, he took a tramp</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many miles. I am in error, of course, in having</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed him to over-ride me. But," Brittlestone smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">deprecatively, "he is a rather difficult man to oppose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come, and I will take you to him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Apparently perfectly friendly, Brittlestone chatted</seg><seg type="columnLine">away as he led me down the wide, white hall. I gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the decided impression that he was neither puzzled nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmed over Hart, that he regarded his ailment as</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">merely fatigue. He was more interested in describing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sanatorium, which he promised to show to me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as I had seen Hart. Before the open door of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">right wing room, he paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is in here, doctor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I entered first, and as I crossed the threshold, I knew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hart lay on his back, his face in repose, his eyes closed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a weariness to his face that was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly fading. 1 had been in the presence of death too</seg><seg type="columnLine">often not to sense it. Brittlestone seemed to realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, too. There was surprise and alarm on his features.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I crossed to the bed, and took up Hart's hand. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no indication of pulse in his wrist, and the flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What--what--" began Brittlestone in an excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "Is he--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is dead," I returned, facing him with an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignation that was perhaps not justified. "Where is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Brand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--" Brittlestone stepped to the bedside, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the dead man's hand. Then he let it fall. "Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must be around. I'll find him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He left the room hurriedly. His odd behavior and</seg><seg type="columnLine">great agitation struck me as exceedingly strange, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more in keeping with the reaction of a close relative</seg><seg type="columnLine">than with a physician. He returned shortly with John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brand, Hart's secretary-lawyer. In the meantime I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had examined the dead man carefully, and found no</seg><seg type="columnLine">clue as to the cause of his death. As Brittlestone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brand entered, I was examining the left arm of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpse. I had found it dotted with the marks of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypodermic needle. With a brief nod to Brand, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed these out to Brittlestone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was morphine administered to the patient with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanction, doctor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes," returned Brittlestone hastily. "He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in frequent pain during the last week. He was utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to sleep at night. I was forced to give him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieting dose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was not aware of that," I said, gazing sternly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the physician. "Nor did you mention it to me, doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was the cause of this pain?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RITTLESTONE licked his lips nervously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had failed to mention it because I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you understood Mr. Hart's condition thoroughly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was subject to violent headaches, a symptom of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequent attacks of acute indigestion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gazed thoughtfully at Brittlestone, and he avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">my glance. I realized, of course, that he had lied. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a clumsy lie, too, evidently spun on the spur of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. But I could see no reason for his falsehood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say he was in pain?" I returned. "That you</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he was suffering from headache? Did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">make no attempt to determine what was wrong? Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you administer drugs here merely upon request ? There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are a dozen hypodermic marks upon his arm. Had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">not died as he did, you were in a fair way to make an</seg><seg type="columnLine">addict of him, for you admit that you administered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drug only this last week."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A dozen ?" Brittlestone, evidently surprised, stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, and examined the dead man's arm. "I ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ministered it to him but three times."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The nurse?" I asked. "Where is she?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," Brittlestone hesitated. "She left yesterday.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is, the one who has been in attendance the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">month. I granted her a two months' vacation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">new one--she is around somewhere. Shall I call her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. She would be of no aid," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That there was something seriously wrong was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent. But each moment I became more puzzled. Brit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlestone's attitude was certainly suspicious, and I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suspect him of criminal activity, and even murder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It left me stunned for a moment, the possibility that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hart had been murdered. I dismissed the idea imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately. For if it was murder, what motive could there</seg><seg type="columnLine">be? A physician does not kill his patients. Yet Hart's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death had been suspiciously sudden, and his illness</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspiciously unnatural. And Brittlestone said he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered intense pain, while in his letter to me he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">described himself as only terribly fatigued. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange circumstance was the absence of any one in</seg><seg type="columnLine">attendance on Hart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to the hypodermic marks, there was no evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of death from morphine, nor indeed from any drug.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither was death from any known disease indicated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brittlestone's confusion concerning the hypodermic</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks was suspicious. Alsdg thought I, he had lied</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them. But his astoni ament and dismay when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had found Hart dead had seemed genuine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was in an absolute quandary. The thought came</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it might be suicide. Perhaps Brittlestone had told</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth, and Hart had simulated pain in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain the drug. But he had not died from morphine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there were nine more marks on the arm than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brittlestone admitted. Perhaps Hart had bribed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurse for the additional doses. Still, what was it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had killed him? I could think, at the moment, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he might have committed suicide by injecting an</seg><seg type="columnLine">air bubble into his blood stream, though this, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not explain his lassitude. I faced my companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Hart seems to have succumbed to an excessive</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigue caused by over-exertion," I declared. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">these extra ministrations of a drug of some kind raises</seg><seg type="columnLine">a doubt that will justify an inquest. Will you kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">notify the coroner, doctor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Brittlestone's eyes flickered oddly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly," he replied, and there was an eagerness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his tone. "I dislike, of course, having any question</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised that will reflect on Happy Lane, but in this case</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feel that it is necessary. I am sure that Mr. Hart</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have bribed his nurse for added amounts of mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phine, but it is evident that this did not cause his death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An inquest will establish that he died from natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">causes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this formal speech, he left the room. I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage of his absence to question Hart's lawyer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary. Brand informed me that he had been with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his employer constantly during the daytime, though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept several rooms away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Were Mr. Hart's affairs in good shape?" I asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did he have any troubles, financial or otherwise, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know of ? Any serious enough to have preyed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No indeed, doctor. In fact, he was more free of</seg><seg type="columnLine">entanglements than he had been at any time I handled</seg><seg type="columnLine">DR. BRITTLESTONES METHOD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his affairs. There was not even a lawsuit pending</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You had noticed no change in him mentally?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--well, he did one thing I, personally, thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, two weeks ago he drew a will leaving half of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his estate to this sanatorium. But it was because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gratitude at having recovered his health here. That-</seg><seg type="columnLine">was before his relapse, you know. He told me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Brittlestone was working wonders both with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanatorium work, and in research. You know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor has a laboratory here, and he spends most of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare time in it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS too overwhelmed for speech. Without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word to Brand, I stepped into the long hallway of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sanatorium, and walked slowly down it. I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Hart had been the victim of an infernally clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">scoundrel, that this Brittlestone was as dangerous a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man as had ever walked the earth. He had made Hart</seg><seg type="columnLine">die a "natural death," a death due to some mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance--some poison utterly unknown. I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Brittlestone's laboratory. I walked to Room 105.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door was unlocked. Quickly entering, I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself in a well-appointed laboratory, replete with</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus for physiological research. As I stood there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspecting the room, fearful of Brittlestone's coming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard a sound. It was the faint footsteps of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, methodical, weary, unvarying. It came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left of me, evidently in the room next. I listened for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several moments. The person in that room was step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping with a measured tread, never slowing up, never</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing his pace. I noted that there was a door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening into that chamber, and I stepped to it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was locked, with the key in the lock. I drew back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolt, and cautiously opened the door. Then I stared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement. A man, lagging of step, was circling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. His hands were manacled behind him. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently worn out, and now and again he sighed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony. His head was drooping, his face lined with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigue. Often he half stumbled as though about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall. I saw that he was held up by a harness that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped to his shoulders, and that this harness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened to a motor on a high track on the wall. Evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently operated by electricity, the car made an endless</seg><seg type="columnLine">round of the chamber. The man, pulled onward by it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forced to walk continuously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I leaped forward, and removed the straps from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders. With a moan, he collapsed into my arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bolt continued to traverse the room, dragging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harness after it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a sound from the doorway. Glancing up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw the huge form of Brittlestone, and farther back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brand. Without a word, Brittlestone stepped back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slammed the door, and locked it. I hearcTa mumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">of voices, a scuffling sound, and the crash of glass. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moment later the door opened again. Brand came in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding a revolver. His face was red, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing heavily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's all this, doctor?" he panted. "Dr. Brittle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone acted like a madman. He tried to shoot me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a time getting the gun. Then he jumped through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window. I guess he's killed. He's lying out there</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the cement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Brittlestone, we found, was dead, his skull fractured.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his laboratory we found memoranda that fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared up the mystery of Hart's death. Hart had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed died from fatigue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brittlestone had made discoveries in physiology that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been much to his credit had he not turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to the nefarious end he did. He had long studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the katabolism of muscular activity, and had succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in preparing a serum containing muscle fatigue stuffs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rather, I gathered from his notes, the actual poison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous principle that induces fatigue. Among his memo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">randa were several pages torn from a work by Angelo</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moss, the Italian physiologist. Certain passages, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were marked, I shall quote:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have now given a rapid glance at the toxic sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances which are produced in the organism." "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">these waste products accumulate in the blood, we feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigued; when their amount passes the physiological</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit, we become ill." " * * * and so long ago as 1887</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found that the blood of a fatigued animal is toxic, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">if injected into another animal, it produces the phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomena characteristic of fatigue." "* * * The idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fatigue is a kind of poisoning resulting from prod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ucts derived from chemical changes in the cells is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">new. The physiologists, Pfluger, Preyer, and Zuntz</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially did much to establish the basis for this opin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion. But we are still at the beginning of our researches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and can say nothing as to the nature of these sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances, and the question is so complex and so contro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versial that I shall certainly not attempt to indicate our</seg><seg type="columnLine">present position with regard to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man I had found a prisoner was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charity patients and from him Brittlestone had gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supply of blood for his experiments. He had kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man eternally walking, allowing him no rest more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than was necessary to keep him alive. Recently Brit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlestone had gone farther than the isolation of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison from the blood of the wearied man. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to synthesize the poison from organic sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Money mad, Brittlestone had made a business of</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing upon the gratitude of his wealthy patients,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining mention in their wills, and then murdering them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his serum. At least five, we learned, had met</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same fate as Hart, but in their cases no question had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been raised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had Brittlestone not killed himself, he would surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">have hanged. As it was, three of his staff were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">victed as accomplices, and sentenced to life imprison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE END.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THOUSAND AND SECOND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TALE OF SCHEHERAZADE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hy Edgar Allan Poe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Author of " The Facts in the Case of M.

The tubular part is internally</seg><seg type="columnLine">beset with stiff hairs, pointing downward. The globular part</seg><seg type="columnLine">contains the pistil, which consists merely of a germen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stigma, together with the surrounding stamens. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamens, being shorter than even the germen, cannot discharge</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma, as the flower stands</seg><seg type="columnLine">always upright till after impregnation. And hence, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">some additional and peculiar aid, the pollen must necessarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall down to the bottom of the flower. Now, the aid that nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">has furnished in this case is, that of the Tiputa Pennicornis, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small insect, which, entering the tube of the corolla in quest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">honey, descends to the bottom and rummages about till it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes quite covered with pollen; but not being able to force its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way out again, owing to the downward position of the hairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which converge to a point like the wires of a mouse-trap, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">being somewhat impatient of its confinement, it brushes back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward and forward, trying every corner, till, after repeatedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversing the stigma, it covers it with pollen sufficient for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">impregnation, in consequence of which the flower soon begins to</seg><seg type="columnLine">droop and the hairs to shrink to the side of the tube, affecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">an easy passage for the escape of the insect."--Rev.

He came to this intercourse re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luctantly. His upbringing had been refined, and, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ill fortune had brought him to that costume, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never spoken in his life, except by way of command or</seg><seg type="columnLine">some immediate necessity, to the white-faced wearers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue canvas. Now at last came contact; he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work beside them, share their tools, eat with them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To both Elizabeth and himself this seemed a further</seg><seg type="columnLine">degradation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His taste would have seemed extreme to a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nineteenth century. But slowly and inevitably in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intervening years a gulf had opened between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearers of the blue canvas and the classes above, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">difference not simply of cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstances and habits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, but of habits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought--even of language.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The underways had devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oped a dialect of their own:</seg><seg type="columnLine">above, too, had arisen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialect, a code of thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a language of "culture,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">which aimed by a sedulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">search after fresh distinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to widen perpetually</seg><seg type="columnLine">the space between itself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"vulgarity." The bond of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a common faith, moreover, no longer held the race to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether.

While we may</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not like all that he has to say about the future, it begins to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">look more and more as though he might be right, and time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only will tell whether he was 100% right when he wrote this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">story. Those of us zvho contemplate the future as a- place</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where none of us will have to work and where zee all will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be glorified loafers, are probably due for sad disappointment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The idea certainly does not seem to be held by Wells, nor is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it borne out in modern day by day progress.

The Labor Company's field workers, in huge wheeled mechanical vehicles, were hurrying back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their meals . . .

And, in spite of their inclina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion towards the ancient fashion of living, neither Eliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beth nor Denton had been sufficiently original to escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suggestion of their surroundings. In matters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">common behavior they had followed the ways of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">class, and so, when they fell at last to be Labor Serfs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed to them almost as though they were falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">among offensive inferior animals; they felt as a nine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teenth-century duke and duchess might have felt who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were forced to take rooms in the Jago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their natural impulse was to maintain a "distance."</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Denton's first idea of a dignified isolation from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his new surroundings was soon rudely dispelled. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had imagined that his fall to the position of a Labor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Serf was the end of his lesson, that when their little</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter had died, he had plumbed the deeps of life;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but indeed these things were only the beginning. Life</seg><seg type="columnLine">demands something more from us than acquiescence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And now in a roomful of machine minders he was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn a wider lesson, to make the acquaintance of an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other factor in life, a factor as elemental as the loss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things dear to us, more elemental even than toil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His quiet discouragement of conversation was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate cause of offense--was interpreted, rightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough I fear, as disdain. His ignorance of the vulgar</seg><seg type="columnLine">dialect, a thing upon which he had hitherto prided</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, suddenly took upon itself a new aspect. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to perceive at once that his reception of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarse and stupid but genially intended remarks that</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted his appearance must have stung the makers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these advances like blows in their faces. "Don't under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand," he said rather coldly, and at hazard, "No, thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man who had addressed him stared, scowled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A second, who also failed at Denton's unaccustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear, took the trouble to repeat his remark, and Denton</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered he was being offered the use of an oil can.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He expressed polite thanks, and this second man em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked upon a penetrating conversation. Denton, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked, had been a swell, and he wanted to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he had come to wear the blue. He clearly expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">an interesting record of vice and extravagance. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denton ever been at a Pleasure City? Denton was</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedily to discover how the existence of these won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful places of delight permeated and defiled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought and honor of these unwilling, hopeless workers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the underworld.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His aristocratic temperament resented these ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. He answered "No" curtly. The man persisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a still more personal question, and this time it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Denton who turned away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gorblimey!" said his interlocutor, much astonished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's a swell."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It presently forced itself upon Denton's mind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this remarkable conversation was being repeated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">indignant tones to more sympathetic hearers, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it gave rise to astonishment and ironical laughter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They looked at Denton with manifestly enhanced in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest. A curious perception of isolation dawned upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him. _ He tried to think of his press and its unfamiliar</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarities. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE machines kept everybody pretty busy during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first spell, and then came a reccss. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only an interval for refreshment, too brief for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to go out to a Labor Company dining-room. Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton followed his fellow-workers into a short gallery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which were a number of bins of refuse from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each man produced a packet of food. Denton had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no packet. The manager, a careless young man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">held his position by influence, had omitted "to warn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denton that it was necessary to apply for this provi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. He stood apart, feeling hungry. The others</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew together in a group and talked in undertones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glancing at him ever and again. He became uneasy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His appearance of disregard cost him an increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort. He tried to think of the levers of his new</seg><seg type="columnLine">press.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently one, a man much shorter but much</seg><seg type="columnLine">broader and stouter than Denton, came forward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Denton turned to him as unconcernedly as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible. "Here!" said the delegate-- as Denton judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to be--extending a cube of bread in a not too</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean hand. He had a swart, broad-nosed face, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth hung down towards one corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton felt doubtful for the instant whether this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was meant for civility or insult. His impulse was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">decline. "No, thanks," he said; and, at the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">change of expression, "I'm not hungry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a laugh from the group behind. "Told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you so," said the man who had offered Denton the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loan of an oil can. "He's top side, he is. .You ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">good enough for 'im."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The swart face grew a shade darker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here," said its owner, still extending the bread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and speaking in a lower tone; "you got to eat this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">See?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton looked into the threatening face before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and odd little currents of energy seemed to be run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning through his limbs and body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't want it," he said, trying a pleasant smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">that twitched and failed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thickset man advanced his face, and the bread</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a physical threat in his hand. Denton's mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed together to the one problem of his antagonist's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eat it," said the swart man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a pause, and then they both moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. The cube of bread described a complicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">path, a curve that would have ended in Denton's face;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then his fist hit the wrist of the hand that gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and it flew upward, and out of the conflict--its</seg><seg type="columnLine">part played.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped back quickly, fists clenched and arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense. The hot, dark countenance receded, became an</seg><seg type="columnLine">alert hostility, watching its chance. Denton for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant felt confident, and strangely buoyant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">serene. His heart beat quickly. He felt his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive, and glowing to the tips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Scrap, boys!" shouted some one, and then the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure had leapt forward, ducked back and sideways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">137</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and come in again. Denton struck out, and was hit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">One of his eyes seemed to him to be demolished, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he felt a soft lip under his fist just before he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hit again--this time under the chin. A huge fan of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fiery needles shot open. He had a momentary per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">suasion that his head was knocked to pieces, and then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something hit his head and back from behind, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fight became an uninteresting, an impersonal thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	He was aware that time--seconds or minutes--had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passed, abstract, uneventful time. He was lying with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his head in a heap of ashes, and something wet and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">warm ran swiftly into his neck. The first shock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">broke up into discrete sensations. All his head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">throbbed; his eye and his chin throbbed exceedingly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the taste of blood was in his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "He's all right," said a voice. "He's opening his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eyes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Serve him - well right," said a second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His mates were standing about him. He made an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">effort and sat up. He put his hand to the back of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his head, and his hair was wet and full of cinders. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">laugh greeted the gesture. His eye was partially</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">closed. He perceived what had happened. His mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mentary anticipation of a final victory had vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Looks surprised," said some one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   " 'Ave any more ?" said a wit; and then, imitating</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Denton's refined accent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No, thank you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Denton perceived the swart man with a blood-stained</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> handkerchief before his face, and somewhat in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> background.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Where's that bit of bread he's got to eat?" said a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> little ferret-faced creature; and sought with his foot in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the ashes of the adjacent bin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Denton had a moment of internal debate. He knew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the code of honor requires a man to pursue a fight he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has begun to the bitter end; but this was his first taste</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the bitterness. He was resolved to rise again, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he felt no passionate impulse. It occurred to him--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and the thought was no very violent spur--that he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perhaps after all a coward. For a moment his will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was heavy, a lump of lead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   " 'Ere it is," said the little ferret-faced man, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stooped to pick up a cindery cube. He looked at Den-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ton, then at the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Slowly, unwillingly, Denton stood up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   A dirty-faced albino extended a hand to the ferret-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> faced man. "Gimme that toke,"* he said. He advanced</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> threateningly, bread in hand, to Denton. "So you ain't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'ad your bellyful yet," he said. "Eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now it was coming. "No, I haven't," said Denton,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a catching of the breath, and resolved to try this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brute behind the ear before he himself got stunned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again. He knew he would be stunned again. He was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">astonished how ill he had judged himself beforehand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A few ridiculous lunges, and down he would go again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He watched the albino's eyes. The albino was grin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ning confidently, like a man who plans an agreeable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trick. A sudden perception of impending indignities</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stung Denton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "You leave 'im alone, Jim," said the swart man sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   ♦Toke is an English slang word meaning food, especially</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> bread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">denly over the blood-stained rag.

He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one to the other. It seemed to Denton that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swart man demanded the privilege of his destruction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The albino would have been better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You leave 'im alone," said the swart man. "See?</seg><seg type="columnLine">'E's 'ad 'is licks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CLATTERING bell lifted up its voice and solved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation. The albino hesitated. "Lucky for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," he said, adding a foul metaphor, and turned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others towards the press-room again. "Wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the spell, mate," said the albino over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder--an afterthought. The swart man waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the albino to precede him. Denton realized that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reprieve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men passed towards an open door. Denton be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came aware of his duties, and hurried to join the tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the queue. At the doorway of the vaulted gallery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of presses a yellow-uniformed labor policeman stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticking a card. He had ignored the swart man's hemor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurry up there!" he said to Denton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello!" he said, at the sight of his facial disarray.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who's been hitting you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's my affair," said Denton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not if it spiles your work, it ain't," said the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in yellow. "You mind that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton made no answer. He was a rough--a laborer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wore the blue canvas. The laws of assault and</seg><seg type="columnLine">battery, he knew, were not for the likes of him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to his press</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could feel the skin of his brow and chin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">head lifting themselves to noble bruises, felt the throb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pain of each aspiring contusion. His nervous sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem slid down to lethargy; at each movement in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">press adjustment he felt he lifted a weight. And as for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his honor--that too throbbed and puffed. How did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stand? What precisely had happened in the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten minutes? What would happen next? He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that here was enormous matter for thought, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not think save in disordered snatches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His mood was a sort of stagnant astonishment. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">his conceptions were overthrown. He had regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">his security from physical violence as inherent, as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the conditions of life. So, indeed, it had been while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wore his middle-class costume, had his middle-class</seg><seg type="columnLine">property to serve for his defense. But who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">interfere among Labor roughs fighting together? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed in those days no man would. In the Under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">world there was no law between man and man; the law</seg><seg type="columnLine">and machinery of the state had become for them some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that held men down, fended them off from much</seg><seg type="columnLine">desirable property and pleasure, and that was all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Violence, that ocean in which the brutes live forever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from which a thousand dykes and contrivances</seg><seg type="columnLine">have won our hazardous civilized life, had flowed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">again upon the sinking underways and submerged them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fist ruled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton had come right down at last to the elemental</seg><seg type="columnLine">--fist and trick and the stubborn heart and fellowship--</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as it was in the beginning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">138</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rhythm of his machine changed,.and his thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he could think again. Strange how quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">things had happened! He bore these men who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrashed him no very vivid ill-will. He was bruised</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enlightened, lie saw with absolute fairness now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reasonableness of his unpopularity. He had behaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a fool. Disdain, seclusion, are the privilege of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong. The fallen aristocrat still clinging to his point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less distinction is surely the most pitiful creature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretense in all this claimant universe. Good heavens!</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was there for him to despise in these men ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What a pity he had not appreciated all this better</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hours ago!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What would happen at the end of the spell? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not tell. He could not imagine. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine the thoughts of these men. He was sensible</seg><seg type="columnLine">only of their hostility and utter want of sympathy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vague possibilities of shame and violence chased one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another across his mind. Could he devise some weapon?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He recalled his assault upon the hypnotist, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no detachable lamps here. He could see nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could catch up in his defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a space he thought of a headlong bolt for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">security of the public ways directly the spell was over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apart from the trivial consideration of his self-respect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he perceived that this would be only a foolish postpone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and aggravation of his trouble. He perceived the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferret-faced man and the albino talking together with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes towards him. Presently they were talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the swart man, who stood with his broad back studi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously towards Denton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last came the end of the second spell. The lender</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oil cans stopped his press sharply and turned round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. *His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the quiet expectation of one who seats himself in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now was the crisis, and all the little nerves of Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's being seemed leaping and dancing. He had decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show fight if any fresh indignity was offered him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stopped his press and turned. With an enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">affectation of ease he walked down the vault and entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passage of the ash pits, only to discover he had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jacket--which he had taken off because of the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vault--beside his press. He walked back. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">met the albino eye to eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard the ferret-faced man in expostulation. " 'E</seg><seg type="columnLine">reely ought, eat it," said the ferret-faced man. " 'E</seg><seg type="columnLine">did reely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--you leave 'im alone," said the swart man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">APPARENTLY nothing further was to happen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that day. He passed out to the passage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">staircase that led up to the moving platforms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He 'emerged on the livid brilliance and streaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement of the public street. He became acutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of his disfigured face,and felt his swelling bruises</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a limp, investigatory hand. He went up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftest platform, and seated himself on a Labor Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany bench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lapsed into a pensive torpor. The immediate dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers and stresses of his position he saw with a sort of?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">static clearness. What would they do to-morrow ? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not tell. WTiat would Elizabeth think of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutalization? He could not tell. He was exhausted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was aroused presently by a hand upon his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked up, and saw the swart man seated beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He started. Surely he was safe from violence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the public way!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The swart man's face retained no traces of his share</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fight; his expression was free from hostility--</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed almost deferential. " 'Scuse me," he said, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a total absence of truculence. Denton realized that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">assault was intended. He stared, awaiting the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">development.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was evident the next sentence was premeditated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Whad--I--was--going--to say--was this," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swart man, and sought through a silence for further</seg><seg type="columnLine">words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whad--I--was--going--to say--was this," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he abandoned that gambit. "You're aw</seg><seg type="columnLine">right," he cried, laying a grimy hand on Denton's grimy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve. "You're aw right. You're a ge'man. Sorry--</seg><seg type="columnLine">very sorry. Wanted to tell you that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton realized that there must exist motives be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond a mere impulse to abominable proceedings in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He meditated, and swallowed an unworthy pride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did not mean to be offensive to you," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"in refusing that bit of bread."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Meant it friendly," said the swart man, recalling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scene; "but--in front of that blarsted Whitey and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his snigger--Well--I 'ad to scrap."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Denton with sudden fervor: "I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">•fool."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ah!" said the swart man, with great satisfaction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's aw right. Shake!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Denton shook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moving platform was rushing by the establish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of a face moulder, and its lower front was a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">display of mirror, designed to stimulate the thirst for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more symmetrical features. Denton caught the reflec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of himself and his new friend, enormously twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broadened. His own face was puffed, one-sided,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blood-stained; a grin of idiotic and insincere ami-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability distorted its latitude. A wisp of hair occluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">one eye. The trick of the mirror presented the swart</seg><seg type="columnLine">man as a gross expansion of lip and nostril. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were linked by shaking hands. Then abruptly this vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion passed--to return to memory in the anaemic medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tations of a waking dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he shook, the swart man made some muddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">remark, to the effect that he had always known he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get on with a gentleman if one came his way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He prolonged the shaking until Denton, under the influ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of the mirror, withdrew his hand. The swart man</seg><seg type="columnLine">became pensive, spat impressively on the platform, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed his theme.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whad I was going to say was this," he said; was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravelled, and shook his head at his foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Denton became curious. "Go on," he said, attentive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The swart man took the plunge. He grasped Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's arm, became intimate in his attitude. " 'Scuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," he said. "Fact is, you done know 'ow to scrap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Done know 'oiv to. Why--you done know 'ow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">139</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">begin. You'll get killed if you don't mind. 'Ouldin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hands--There!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reinforced his statement by objurgation, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the effect of each oath with a wary eye.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "F'r instance. You're tall. Long arms. You get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer reach than any one in the brasted vault. Gob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blimey, but I thought I'd got a Tough on.

He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">good enough to say he liked the look of Denton, thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had stood up "amazing plucky.

"But--" he said, "I can't give you</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the ge'man all over," said the swart man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who arst you to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But your time ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you don't get learnt scrapping you'll get killed,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you make no bones of that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton thought. "I don't know," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at the face beside him, and all its native</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarseness shouted at him. He felt a quick revulsion</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his transient friendliness. It seemed to him in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible that it should be necessary for him to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">indebted to such a creature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The chaps are always scrapping," said the swart</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. "Always. And, of course--if one gets waxy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 'its you vital. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By God!" cried Denton; "I wish one would."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, if you feel like that--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't understand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "P'raps I don't," said the swart man; and lapsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a fuming silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he spoke again his voice was less friendly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he prodded Denton by way of address. "Look see!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said; "are you going to let me show you 'ow to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrap ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's tremendously kind of you," said Denton;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a pause. The swart man rose and bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Denton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Too much ge'man," he said--"eh? I got a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. ... By gosh ! you are--you arc a brasted fool!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned away, and instantly Denton realized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth of this remark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE swart man descended with dignity to a cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and Denton, after a momentary impulse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit, remained on the platform. For a time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that had happened filled his mind. In one day</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his graceful system of resignation had been shattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond hope. Brute force, the final, the fundamental,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thrust its face through all his explanations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glosses and consolations and grinned enigmatically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though he was hungry and tired, he did not go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly to the Labor Hotel, where he would meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth. lie found he was beginning to think, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted very greatly to think; and so, wrapped in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous cloud of meditation, he went the circuit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city on his moving platform twice. You figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, tearing through the glaring, thunder-voiced city</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a pace of fifty miles an hour, the city upon the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">that spins along its chartless path through space many</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of miles an hour, funking most terribly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to understand why the heart and will in him</seg><seg type="columnLine">should suffer and keep alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When at last he came to Elizabeth, she was white</seg><seg type="columnLine">and anxious. He might have noted she was in trouble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it not been for his own preoccupation. He feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">most that she would desire to know every detail of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">indignities, that she would be sympathetic or indig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant. He saw her eyebrows rise at the sight of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've had rough handling," he said, and gasped. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">too fresh--too hot. I don't want to talk about it." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down with an unavoidable air of sullenness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stared at him in astonishment, and as she read</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of the significant hieroglyphic of his battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, her lips whitened. Her hand--it was thinner now</seg><seg type="columnLine">than in the days of their prosperity, and her first finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little altered by the metal punching she did--</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched convulsively. "This horrible world!" she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In these latter days they had become a very silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple; they said scarcely a word to each other that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, but each followed a private train of thought. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small hours, as Elizabeth lay awake, Denton started</seg><seg type="columnLine">up beside her suddenly--he had been lying as still as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I cannot stand it!" cried Denton. "I will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She saw him dimly, sitting up; saw his arm lunge</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if in a furious blow at the enshrouding night. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a space he was still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is too much--it is more than one can bear!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She could say nothing. To her, also, it seemed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was as far as one could go. She waited through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long stillness. She could see that Denton sat with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms about his knees, his chin almost touching them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said at last, "I'm going to stand it. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peculiar thing. There isn't a grain of suicide in us</seg><seg type="columnLine">--not a grain. I suppose all the people with a turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way have gone.

She marked his movements, perceived with</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment how he adjusted his pillow with a careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard to comfort. He lay down with a sigh of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentment almost. His passion had passed. He lay still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently his breathing became regular and deep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT Elizabeth remained with eyes wide open in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, until the clamor of a bell and the sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den brilliance of the electric light warned them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Labor Company had need of them for yet another</seg><seg type="columnLine">day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That day came a scuffle with the albino Whitey and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little ferret-faced man. Blunt, the swart artist in</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrapping, having first let Denton grasp the bearing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lesson, intervened, not without a certain quality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">patronage. "Drop 'is 'air, Whitey, and let the man be,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said his gross voice through a shower of indignities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can't you see 'e don't know 'ow to scrap?" And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denton, lying shamefully in the dust, realized that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must accept that course of instruction after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made his apology straight and clean. He scram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled up and walked to Blunt. "I was a fool, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are right," he said. "If it isn't too late. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night, after the second spell, Denton went with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blunt to certain waste and slime-soaked vaults under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Port of London, to learn the first beginnings of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high art of scrapping as it had been perfected in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great world of the underways: how to hit or kick a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">so as to hurt him excruciatingly or make him violently</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick, how to hit or kick "vital," how to use glass in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's garments as a club and to spread red ruin with</seg><seg type="columnLine">various domestic implements, how to anticipate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">demolish your adversary's intentions in other direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions; all the pleasant devices, in fact, that had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">up among the disinherited of the great cities of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentieth and twenty-first centuries, were spread out by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gifted exponent for Denton's learning. Blunt's bash-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness fell from him as the instruction proceeded, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he developed a certain expert dignity, a quality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatherly consideration. He treated Denton with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost consideration, only "flicking him up a bit" now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, to keep the interest hot, and roaring with</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter at a happy fluke of Denton's that covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth with blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm always keerless of my mouth," said Blunt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitting a weakness. "Always. It don't seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter, like, just getting bashed in the mouth--not if</seg><seg type="columnLine">your chin's all right. Tastin' blood does me good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Always. But I better not 'it you again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton went home, to fall asleep exhausted and wake</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the small hours with aching limbs and all his bruises</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingling. Was it worth while that he should go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">living? He listened to Elizabeth's breathing, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membering that he must have awaked her the previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, he lay very still. He was sick with infinite dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gust at the new conditions of his life. He hated it all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated even the genial savage who had protected him so</seg><seg type="columnLine">generously. The monstrous fraud of civilization glared</seg><seg type="columnLine">stark before his eyes; he saw it as a vast lunatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth, producing a deepening torrent of savagery be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, and above ever more flimsy gentility and silly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wastefulness. He could see no redeeming reason, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of honor, either in the life he had led or in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">life to which he had fallen. Civilization presented</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself as some catastrophic product as little concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with men--save as victims--as a cyclone or a planetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">collision. He, and therefore all mankind, seemed living</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly in vain. His mind sought some strange expedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ents of escape, if not for himself, then at least for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth. But he meant them for himself. What if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hunted up Mwres and told him of their disaster?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It came to him as an astonishing thing how utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mwres and Bindon had passed out of his range. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">were they? What were they doing? From that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed to thoughts of utter dishonor. And finally, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">arising in any way out of this mental tumult, but end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it as dawn ends the night, came the clear and obvi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous conclusion of the night before: the conviction that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had to go through with things; that, apart from any</seg><seg type="columnLine">remoter view and quite sufficient for all his thought and</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy, he had to stand up and fight among his fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quit himself like a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second night's instruction was perhaps less</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreadful than the first; and the third was even endur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, for Blunt dealt out some praise. The fourth day</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denton chanced upon the fact that the ferret-faced man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a coward. There passed a fortnight of smoulder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing days and feverish instruction at night; Blunt, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">many blasphemies, testified that never had he met so</seg><seg type="columnLine">apt a pupil; and all night long Denton dreamt of kicks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and counters and gouges and cunning tricks. For all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time no further outrages were attempted, for fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Blunt; and then came the second crisis. Blunt did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not come one day--afterwards he admitted his deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate intention--and through the tedious morning Whitey</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited the interval between the spells with an osten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatious impatience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew nothing of the scrapping lessons, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent the time in telling Denton and the vault generally</seg><seg type="columnLine">of certain disagreeable proceedings he had in mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">141</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHITEY was not popular, and the vault disgorged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see him haze the new man with only a languid</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest. But matters changed when Whitey's attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to open the proceedings by kicking Denton in the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was met by an excellently executed duck, catch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw, that completed the flight of Whitey's foot in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit and brought Whitey's head into the ash-heap that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once received Denton's. Whitey arose a shade</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiter, and now blasphemously bent upon vital injur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies. There were indecisive passages, foiled enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prises that deepened Whitey's evidently growing per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexity ; and then things developed into a grouping of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denton uppermost with Whitey's throat in his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knee on Whitey's chest, and a tearful Whitey with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black face, protruding tongue and broken finger -endeav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oring to explain the misunderstanding by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse sounds. Moreover, it was evident that among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bystanders there had never been a more popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">person than Denton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton with proper precaution, released his antag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onist and stood up. His blood seemed changed to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of fluid fire, his limbs felt light and supernaturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong. The idea that he was a martyr in the civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion machine had vanished from his mind. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in a world of men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little ferret-faced man was the first in the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petition to pat him on the back. The lender of oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans was a radiant sun of genial congratulation. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed incredible to Denton that he had ever thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton was convinced that not only had he to go on</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with things, but that he could. He sat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas pallet expounding this new aspect to Elizabeth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One side of his face was bruised. She had not recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought, she had not been patted on the back, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no hot bruises upon her face, only a pallor and a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">line or so about the mouth. She was taking the woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">share. She looked steadfastly at Denton in his new</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood of prophecy. "I feel that there is something,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was saying, "something that goes on, a Being'oT Life</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which we live and move and have our being, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that began fifty--a hundred million years ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, that goes on--on: growing, spreading, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">things beyond us--things that will justify us all. . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">That will explain and justify my fighting--these</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruises, and all the pain of it. It's the chisel--yes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chisel of the Maker. If only I could make you feel as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feel, if I could make you! You will, dear, I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," she said in a low voice. "No, I shall not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I might have thought--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head. "No," she said, "I have thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well. What you say--doesn't convince me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at his face resolutely. "I hate it," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and caught at her breath. "You do not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, you do not think. There was a time when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">said things and I believed them. I am growing wiser.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are a man, you can fight, force your way. You do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not mind bruises. You can be coarse and ugly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still a man. Yes--it makes you. It makes you. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are right. Only a woman is not like that. We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">different. We have let ourselves get civilized too soon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This underworld is not for us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She paused and began again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hate it! I hate this horrible canvas! I hate it</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than--more than the worst that can happen. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurts my fingers to touch it. It is horrible to the skin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the women I work with day after day! I lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake at nights and think how I may be growing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stopped. "I am growing like them," she cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">passionately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton stared at her distress. "But--" he said and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't understand. Wrhat have I? What have</seg><seg type="columnLine">I to save me ? You can fight. Fighting is man's work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But women--women are different. ... I have thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all out, I have done nothing but think night and day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look at the color of my face! I cannot go 011. I can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not endure this life ... I cannot endure it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stopped. She hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do not know all," she said abruptly, and for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant her lips had a bitter smile. "I have been asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leave me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She made no answer save an affirmative movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DENTON stood up sharply. They stared at one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other through a long silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she turned herself about, and flung face</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward upon their canvas bed. She did not sob, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no sound. She lay still upon her face. After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast, distressful void her shoulders heaved and she be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to weep silently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Elizabeth!" he whispered--"Elizabeth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very softly he sat down beside her, bent down, put</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm across her in a doubtful caress, seeking vainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some clue to this intolerable situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Elizabeth," he whispered in her ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She thrust him from her with her hand. "I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear a child to be a slave!" and broke out into loud and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter weeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Denton's face changed--became blank dismay. Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently he slipped from the bed and stood on his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the complacency had vanished from his face, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given place to impotent rage. He began to rave and</seg><seg type="columnLine">curse at the intolerable forces which pressed upon him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all the accidents and hot desires and heedlessness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mock the life of man. His little voice rose in that little</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and he shook his fist, this animalcule of the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all that environed him about, at the millions about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, at his past and future and all the insensate vastness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the overwhelming city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bindon Intervenes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN Bindon's younger days he had dabbled in specu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation and made three brilliant flukes. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of his life he had the wisdom to let gambling</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, and the conceit to believe himself a very clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. A certain desire for influence and reputation</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested him in the business intrigues of the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">city in which his flukes were made. He became at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last one of the most influential shareholders in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">142</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">company that owned the London flying-stages to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aeroplanes came from all parts of the world. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for his public activities. In his private life he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a man of pleasure. And this is the story of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before proceeding to such depths, one must</seg><seg type="columnLine">devote a little time to the exterior of this person. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical basis was slender, and short, and dark; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face, which was fine-featured and assisted by pig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, varied from an insecure self-complacency to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligent uneasiness. His face and head had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">depilated, according to the cleanly and hygienic fashion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the time, so that the color and contour of his hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">varied with his costume. This he was constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">changing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At times he would distend himself with pneumatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestments in the rococo vein. From among the billowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">developments of this style, and beneath a translucent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and illuminated headdress, his eye watched jealously</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the respect of the less fashionable world. At other</seg><seg type="columnLine">times he emphasized his elegant slenderness in close-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitting garments of black satin. For effects of dignity</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would assume broad pneumatic shoulders, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which hung a robe of carefully arranged folds of China</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk, and a classical Bindon in pink tights was also a</seg><seg type="columnLine">transient phenomenon in the eternal pageant of Destiny.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the days when he hoped to marry Elizabeth, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought to impress and charm her, and at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take off something of his burden of forty years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by wearing the last fancy of the contemporary buck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a costume of elastic material with distensible warts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and horns, changing in color as he walked, by an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">genious arrangement of versatile chromatophores.*</seg><seg type="columnLine">And no doubt, if Elizabeth's affection had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">already engaged by the worthless Denton, and if her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastes had not had that odd bias for old-fashioned ways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this extremely chic conception would have ravisehd her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bindon had consulted Elizabeth's father before pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senting himself in this garb--he was one of those men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who always invite criticism of their costume--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mwres had pronounced him all that the heart of woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">could desire. But the affair of the hypnotist proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his knowledge of the heart of woman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">incomplete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bindon's idea of marrying had been formed some</seg><seg type="columnLine">little time before Mwres threw Elizabeth's budding</seg><seg type="columnLine">womanhood in his way. It was one of Bindon's most</seg><seg type="columnLine">cherished secrets that he had a considerable capacity</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a pure and simple life of a grossly sentimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">type. The thought imparted a sort of pathetic seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ousness to the offensive and quite inconsequent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmeaning excesses, which he was pleased to regard</seg><seg type="columnLine">as dashing wickedness, and which a number of good</seg><seg type="columnLine">people also were so unwise as to treat in that desirable</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. As a consequence of these excesses, and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps by reason also of an inherited tendency to early</seg><seg type="columnLine">decay, his liver became seriously affected, and he suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered increasing inconvenience when traveling by aero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane. It was during his convalescence from a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted bilious attack that it occurred to him that in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *	A pigment cell, especially one capable of changing its form</seg><seg type="columnLine">or size, causing changing of color in the translucent skin by</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing the pigment near the surface or by contracting, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrating it in the deeper layers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of all the terrible fascinations of Vice, if he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a beautiful, gentle, good young woman of a not too</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently intellectual type to devote her life to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might yet be saved to Goodness, and even rear a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirited family in his likeness to solace his declining</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. But like so many experienced men of the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he doubted if there were any good women. Of stich</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had heard tell he was outwardly sceptical and</seg><seg type="columnLine">privately much afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the aspiring Mwres effected his introduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to Elizabeth, it seemed to him that his good</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune was complete. He fell in love with her at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. Of course, he had always been falling in love</seg><seg type="columnLine">since he was sixteen, in accordance with the extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">varied recipes to be found in the accumulated litera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of many centuries. But this was different. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was real love. It seemed to him to call forth all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurking goodness in his nature. He felt that for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake he could give up a way of life that had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced the gravest lesions on his liver and nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">system. His imagination presented him with idyllic</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures of the life of the reformed rake. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never be sentimental with her, or silly; but always a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little cynical and bitter, as became the past. Yet he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sure she would have an intuition of his real great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and goodness. And in due course he would con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fess things to her, pour his version of what he regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his wickedness--showing what a complex of Goethe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Benvenuto Cellini, and Shelley, and all those other</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaps he really w'as--into her shocked, very beautiful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no doubt sympathetic ear. And preparatory to</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things he wooed her with infinite subtlety and</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect. And the reserve with which Elizabeth treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">him seemed nothing more nor less than an exquisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">modesty touched and enhanced by an equally exquisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of ideas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bindon knew nothing of her wandering affections,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor of the attempt made by Mwres to utilize hypnotism</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a corrective to this digression of her heart; he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived he was on the best of terms with Elizabeth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made her quite successfully various significant</seg><seg type="columnLine">presents of jewelry and the more virtuous cosmetics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when her elopement^,vith Denton threw the world out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gear for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His first aspect of the matter was rage begotten of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded vanity, and as Mwres happened to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most convenient person, he vented the first brunt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went immediately and insulted the desolate father</seg><seg type="columnLine">grossly, and then spent an active and determined day</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to and fro about the city and interviewing people</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a consistent and partly successful attempt to ruin</seg><seg type="columnLine">that matrimonial speculator. The effectual nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these activities gave him a temporary exhilaration, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went to the dining-place he had frequented in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wicked days in a devil-may-care frame of mind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dined altogether too amply and cheerfully with two</seg><seg type="columnLine">other golden youths in the early forties. He threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the game; no woman was worth being good for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he astonished even himself by the strain of witty</seg><seg type="columnLine">cynicism he developed. One of the other desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">blades, warmed with wine, made a facetious allusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">143</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to his disappointment, but at the time this did not seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning found his liver and temper in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flamed. He kicked his phonographic-news machine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces, dismissed his valet, and resolved that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpetrate a terrible revenge upon Elizabeth. Or Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. Or somebody. But anyhow, it was to be a ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible revenge; and the friend who had made fun at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him should no longer see him in the light of a foolish</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's victim. He knew something of the little property</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was due to her. and that this would be the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">support of the young couple until Mwres should relent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If Mwres did not relent, and if unpropitious things</seg><seg type="columnLine">should happen to the affair in which Elizabeth's ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectations lay, they would come upon evil times and be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently amenable to temptation of' a sinister sort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bindon's imagination, abandoning its beautiful ideal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ism altogether, expanded the idea of temptation of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister sort. He figured himself as the implacable, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intricate and powerful man of wealth pursuing this</seg><seg type="columnLine">maiden who had scorned him. And suddenly her image</seg><seg type="columnLine">came upon his mind, vivid and dominant, and for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time in his life Bindon realized something of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">real power of passion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His imagination stood aside like a respectful foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who has done his work in ushering in the emotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" cried Bindon: "I will have her! If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to kill myself to get her! And that other</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow--!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After an interview with his medical man and a pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance for his overnight excesses in the form of bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">drugs, a mitigated but absolutely resolute Bindon sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">out Mwres. Mwres he found properly smashed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">impoverished and humble, in a mood of frantic self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preservation, ready to sell himself body and soul, much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more any interest in a disobedient daughter, to recover</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lost position in the world. In the reasonable dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion that followed, it was agreed that these mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guided young people should be left to sink into distress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or possibly even assisted towards that improving dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipline by Bindon's financial influence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then?" said Mwres.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They will come to the Labor Company," said Bin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don. "They will wear the blue canvas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She will divorce him," he said, and sat for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">intent upon that prospect. For in those days the austere</seg><seg type="columnLine">limitations of divorce of Victorian times were extraor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinarily relaxed, and a couple might separate on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred different scores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN suddenly Bindon astonished himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mwres by jumping to his feet. "She shall divorce</seg><seg type="columnLine">him!" he cried. "I will have it so--I will work it so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By God! it shall be so. He shall be disgraced, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she must. He shall be smashed and pulverized."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The idea of smashing and pulverizing inflamed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">further. He began a Jovian pacing up and down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little office. "I will have her," he cried. "I will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">her! Heaven and Hell shall not save her from me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">His passion evaporated in its expression, and left him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the end simply histrionic. He struck an attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ignored with heroic determination a sharp twinge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of pain about the diaphragm. And Mwres sat with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pneumatic cap deflated and himself very visibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so, with a fair persistency, Bindon set himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the work of being Elizabeth's malignant providence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">using with ingenious dexterity every particle of advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage wealth in those days gave a man over his fel.low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures. A resort to the consolations of religion</seg><seg type="columnLine">hindered these operations not at all. He would go and</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk with an interesting, experienced and sympathetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Father of the Huysmanite sect of the Isis cult, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the irrational little proceedings he was pleased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard as his heaven-dismaying wickedness, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting, experienced and sympathetic Father rep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resenting Heaven dismayed, would with a pleasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">affectation of horror, suggest simple and easy penances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and recommend a monastic foundation that was airy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool, hygienic, and not vulgarized, for viscerally dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered penitent sinners of the refined and wealthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">type. And after these excursions, Bindon would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to London quite active and passionate again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would machinate with really considerable energy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">repair to a certain gallery high above the street of mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ways, from which he could view the entrance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barrack of the Labor Company in the ward which</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheltered Denton and Elizabeth. And at last one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw Elizabeth go in, and thereby his passion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">renewed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So in the fullness of time the complicated devices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bindon ripened, and he could go to Mwres and tell him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the young people were near despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's time for you," he said, "to let your parental</seg><seg type="columnLine">affections have play. She's been in blue canvas some</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, and they've been cooped together in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those Labor dens, and the little girl is dead. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows now what his manhood is worth to her, by way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of protection, poor girl. She'll see things now in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearer light. You go to her--I don't want to appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this affair yet--and point out to her how necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is that she should get a divorce from him. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's obstinate," said Mwres doubtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Spirit!" said Bindon. She's a wonderful girl--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful girl!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She'll refuse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course she will. But leave it open to her. Leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">it open to her. And some day--in that stuffy den, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that irksome, toilsome life they can't help it--they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a quarrel. And then--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mwres meditated over the matter, and did as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">told.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Bindon, as he had arranged with his spiritual</seg><seg type="columnLine">adviser, went into retreat. The retreat of the Huys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manite sect was a beautiful place, with the sweetest air</seg><seg type="columnLine">in London, lit by natural sunlight, and with restful</seg><seg type="columnLine">quadrangles of real grass open to the sky, where at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time the penitent man of pleasure might enjoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the pleasures of loafing and all the satisfaction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguished austerity. And. save for participation in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the simple and wholesome dietary of the place and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain magnificent chants, Bindon spent all his time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in meditation upon the theme of Elizabeth, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme purification his soul had undergone since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">first saw her, and whether he would be able to get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">144</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dispensation to marry her from the experienced and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathetic Father in spite of the approaching "sin"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her divorce; and then . . . Bindon would lean</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a pillar of the quadrangle and lapse into rever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies on the superiority of virtuous love to any other form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of indulgence. A curious feeling in his back and chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was trying to attract his attention, a disposition to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be hot or shiver, a general sense of ill-health and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutaneous discomfort he did his best to ignore. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of course belonged to the old life that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he came out of retreat he went at once to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mwres to ask for news of Elizabeth. Mwres was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly under the impression that he was an exemplary</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, profoundly touched about the heart by his child's</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhappiness. "She was pale," he said, greatly moved;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She was pale. When I asked her to come away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave him--and be happy--she put her head down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table"--Mwres sniffed--"and cried."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His agitation was so great that he could say no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" said Bindon, respecting this manly grief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh!" said Bindon quite suddenly, with his hand to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mwres looked up sharply out of the pit of his sor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows, startled. "What's the matter ?" he asked, visibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A most violent pain. Excuse me! You were tell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me about Elizabeth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND Mwres, after a decent solicitude for Bindon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain, proceeded with his report. It was even</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpectedly hopeful. Elizabeth, in her first emotion</seg><seg type="columnLine">at discovering that her father had not absolutely de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serted her, had been frank with him about her sorrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disgusts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Bindon, magnificently, "I shall have her</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet." And then that novel pain twitched him for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For these lower pains the priest was comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">ineffectual, inclining rather to regard the body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as mental illusions amenable to contemplation;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so Bindon took it to a man of a class he loathed, a medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal man of extraordinary repute and incivility. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must go all over you," said the medical man, and did so</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the most disgusting frankness. "Did you ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring any children into the world?" asked this gross</seg><seg type="columnLine">materialist among other impertinent questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not that I know of," said Bindon, too amazed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand upon his dignity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" said the medical man, and proceeded with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">punching and sounding. Medical science in those days</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just reaching the beginnings of precision. "You'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">better go right away," said the medical man, "and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Euthanasia. The sooner the better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bindon gasped. He had been trying not to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand the technical explanations and anticipations in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the medical man had indulged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say!" he said. "But do you mean to say . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your science . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing," said the medical man. "A few opiates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thing is your own doing, you know, to a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was sorely tempted in my youth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's not that so much. But you come of a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock. Even if you'd have taken precautions you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had bad times to wind up with. The mistake</seg><seg type="columnLine">was getting born. The indiscretions of the parents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And you've shirked exercise, and so forth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had no one to advise me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Medical men are always willing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was a spirited young fellow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We won't argue; the mischief's done now. You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived. We can't start you again. You ought never to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have started at all. Frankly--the Euthanasia!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bindon hated him in silence for a space. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of this brutal expert jarred upon his refinements.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was so gross, so impermeable to all the subtler</seg><seg type="columnLine">issues of being. But it is no good picking a quarrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a doctor. "My religious beliefs," he said, "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">approve of suicide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've been doing it all your life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, anyhow, I've come to take a serious view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're bound to, if you go on living. You'll hurt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But for practical purposes it's late. However, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean to do that--perhaps I'd better mix you a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. You'll hurt a great deal. These little</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinges . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twinges!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mere preliminary notices."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long can I go on? I mean, before I hurt--</seg><seg type="columnLine">really."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll get it hot soon. Perhaps three days."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bindon tried to argue for an extension of time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the midst of his pleading gasped, put his hand to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Suddenly the extraordinary pathos of his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him clear and vivid. "It's hard," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's infernally hard! I've been no man's enemy but</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own. I've always treated everybody quite fairly."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The medical man stared at him without any sympathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some seconds. He was reflecting how excellent it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that there were no more Bindons to carry on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of pathos. He felt quite optimistic. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to his telephone and ordered up a prescription</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Central Pharmacy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was interrupted by a voice behind him. "By</seg><seg type="columnLine">God!" cried Bindon; "I'll have her yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The physician stared over his shoulder at Bindon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression, and then altered the prescription.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">So soon as this painful interview was over, Bindon</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave way to rage. He settled that the medical man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not only an unsympathetic brute and wanting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first beginnings of a gentleman, but also highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">incompetent; and he went off to four other practitioners</seg><seg type="columnLine">in succession, with a view to the establishment of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">intuition. But to guard against surprises he kept that</seg><seg type="columnLine">little prescription in his pocket. With each he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">by expressing his grave doubts of the first doctor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence, honesty and professional knowledge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then stated his symptoms, suppressing only a few more</seg><seg type="columnLine">material facts in each case. These were always sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequently elicited by the doctor. In spite of the wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come depreciation of another practitioner, none of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">eminent specialists would give Bindon any hope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eluding the anguish and helplessness that loomed now</seg><seg type="columnLine">close upon him. To the last of them he unburdened</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">145</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind of an accumulated disgust with medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">science. "After centuries and centuries," he exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotly; "and you can do nothing--except admit your</seg><seg type="columnLine">helplessness. I say, 'save me'--and what do you do?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No doubt it's hard on you," said the doctor. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">you should have taken precautions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How was I to know?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It wasn't our place to run after you," said the medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal man, picking a thread of cotton from his purple</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve. "Why should we save you in particular? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">see--from one point of view--people with imaginations</seg><seg type="columnLine">and passions like yours have to go--they have to go."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Die out. It's an eddy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE was a young man with a serene face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled at Bindon. "We get on with research,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know; we give advice when people have the sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask for it. And we bide our time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bide your time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We hardly know enough yet to take over the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agement, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The management?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You needn't be anxious. Science is young yet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's got to keep on growing for a few generations. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">know enough now to know we don't know enough yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . But the time is coming, all the same. You won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the time. But, between ourselves, you rich men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and party bosses, with your natural play of the passions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and patriotism and religion and so forth, have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather a mess of things; haven't you? These Under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways! And all that sort of thing. Some of us have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of fancy that in time we may know enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take over a little more than the ventilation and drains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowledge keeps on piling up, you know. It keeps</seg><seg type="columnLine">on growing. And there's not the slightest hurry for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a generation or so. Some day--some day, men will</seg><seg type="columnLine">live in a different way." He looked at Bindon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">meditated. "There'll be a lot of dying out before that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day can come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bindon attempted to point out to this young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">how silly and irrelevant such talk was to a sick man</seg><seg type="columnLine">like himself, how impertinent and uncivil it was to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an older man occupying a position in the official world</seg><seg type="columnLine">of extraordinary power and influence. He insisted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a doctor was paid to cure people--he laid great stress</seg><seg type="columnLine">on "paid"--and had no business to glance even for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment at "those other questions." "But we do," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young man, insisting upon facts, and Bindon lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">his temper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His indignation carried him home. That these in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">competent impostors, who were unable to save the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a really influential man like himself, should dream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some day robbing the legitimate property owners</seg><seg type="columnLine">of social control, of inflicting one knew not what</seg><seg type="columnLine">tyranny upon the world. Curse science! He fumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the intolerable prospect for some time, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pain returned, and he recalled the made-up pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription of the first doctor, still happily in his pocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took a dose forthwith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It calmed and soothed him greatly, and he could sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in his most comfortable chair beside his library</seg><seg type="columnLine">(of phonographic records), and think over the altered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> aspect of affairs. His indignation passed, his anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his passion crumbled under the subtle attack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that prescription, pathos became his sole ruler. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared about him, at his magnificent and voluptuously</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointed apartment, at his statuary and discreetly</seg><seg type="columnLine">veiled pictures, and all the evidences of a cultivated</seg><seg type="columnLine">and elegant wickedness; he touched a stud and the sad</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipings of Tristan's shepherd filled the air. His eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered from one object to another. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">costly and gross and florid--but they were his. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented in concrete form his ideals, his conceptions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of beauty and desire, his idea of all that is precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">in life. And now--he must leave it all like a common</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He was, he felt, a slender and delicate flame,</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning out. So must all life flame up and pass, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. His eyes filled with tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it came into his head that he was alone. No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body cared for him, nobody needed him! at any mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment he might begin to hurt vividly. He might even</seg><seg type="columnLine">howl. Nobody would mind. According to all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctors he would have excellent reason for howling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day or so. It recalled what his spiritual adviser had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said of the decline of faith and fidelity, the degenera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the age. He beheld himself as a pathetic proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this; he, the subtle, able, important, voluptuous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cynical, complex Bindon, possibly howling, and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">one faithful simple creature in all the world to howl</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sympathy. Not one faithful simple soul was there--</seg><seg type="columnLine">no shepherd to pipe to him! Had all such faithful</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple creatures vanished from this harsh and urgent</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth ? He wondered whether the horrid vulgar crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">that perpetually went about the city could possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what he thought of them. If they did he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure some would try to earn a better opinion. Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world went from bad to worse. It was becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible for Bindons. Perhaps some day . . . He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite sure that the one thing he had needed in life</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sympathy. For a time he regretted that he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sonnets--no enigmatical pictures or something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sort behind him, to carry on his being, until at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sympathetic mind should come . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT seemed incredible to him that this that came was</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinction. Yet his sympathetic spiritual guide was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this matter annoyingly figurative and vague. Curse</seg><seg type="columnLine">science! It had undermined all faith--all hope. To go</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, to vanish from theatre and street, from office and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining-place, from the dear eyes of womankind. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be missed! On the whole to leave the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">happier!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He reflected that he had never worn his heart upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sleeve. Had he after all been too unsympathetic?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Few people could suspect how subtly profound he really</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beneath the mask of that cynical gaiety of his.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They would not understand the loss they had suffered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth, for example, had not suspected. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had reserved that. His thoughts having come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Elizabeth gravitated about her for some time. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Elizabeth understood him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That thought became intolerable. Before all other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things he must set that right. He realized that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still something for him to do in life, his struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Elizabeth was even yet not over. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">146</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">never overcome her now, as he had hoped and prayed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he might still impress her!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that idea he expanded. He might impress</seg><seg type="columnLine">her profoundly--he might impress her so that she.</seg><seg type="columnLine">should for evermore regret her treatment of him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that she must realize before everything else was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his magnanimity. His magnanimity! Yes! he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved her with amazing greatness of heart. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seen it so clearly before--but of course he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to leave her aM his property. He saw it instantly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a thing determined and inevitable. She would think</seg><seg type="columnLine">how good he was, how spaciously generous; surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by all that makes life tolerable from his hand, she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">recall with infinite regret her scorn and coldness. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she sought expression for that regret, she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find that occasion gone forever, she should be met by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a locked door, by a disdainful stillness, by a white dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. He closed his eyes and remained for a space</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagining himself that white dead face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that, he passed to other aspects of the matter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his determination was assured. He meditated</seg><seg type="columnLine">elaborately before he took action, for the drug he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken inclined him to a lethargic and dignified melan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">choly. In certain respects he modified details. Ti he</seg><seg type="columnLine">left all his property to Elizabeth it would include the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voluptuously appointed room he occupied, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">many reasons he did not care to leave that to her. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other hand, it had to be left to some one. In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clogged condition this worried him extremely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the end he decided to leave it to the sympathetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">exponent of the fashionable religious cult, whose con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation had been so pleasing in the past. "He will</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand," said Bindon with a sentimental sigh. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows what Evil means--he understands something</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Stupendous Fascination of the Sphinx of Sin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes--he will understand." By that phrase it was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bindon was pleased to dignify certain unhealthy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">undignified departures from sane conduct to which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">misguided vanity and an ill-controlled curiosity had</seg><seg type="columnLine">led him. He sat for a space, thinking how very Hellenic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Italian and Neronic, and all those things, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. Even now--might one not try a sonnet? A</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrating voice to echo down the ages, sensuous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister, and sad. For a space he forgot Elizabeth. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course of half an hour he spoiled three phonographic</seg><seg type="columnLine">coils, got a headache, took a second dose to calm him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and reverted to magnanimity and his former</seg><seg type="columnLine">design.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last he faced the unpalatable problem of Denton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It needed all his newborn magnanimity before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallow the thought of Denton: but at last this greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">misunderstood man, assisted by his sedative and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">near approach of death, effected even that. Tf he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all exclusive about Denton, if he should display the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest distrust, if he attempted any specific exclusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that young man, she might--misunderstand. Yes--</seg><seg type="columnLine">she should have her Denton still. His magnanimity</seg><seg type="columnLine">must go even to that. He tried to think only of Eliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beth in the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose with a sigh, and limped across to the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phonic apparatus that communicated with his solicitor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In ten minutes a will duly attested and with its proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb-mark signature lay in the solicitor's office three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">miles away. And then for a space Bindon sat very</seg><seg type="columnLine">still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he started out of a vague reverie and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed an investigatory hand to his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he jumped eagerly to his feet and rushed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telephone. The Euthanasia Company had rarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">been called by a client in a greater hurry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO it came at last that Denton and his Elizabeth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">against all hope, returned unseparated from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor servitude to which they had fallen. Elizabeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out from her cramped subterranean den of metal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaters and all the sordid circumstances of blue canvas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one comes out of a nightmare. Back towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight their fortune took them; once the bequest was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to them, the bare thought of another day's ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mering became intolerable. They went up long lifts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stairs to levels that they had not seen since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of their disaster. At first she was full of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation of escape; even to think of the underways</seg><seg type="columnLine">was intolerable; only after many months could she</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin to recall with sympathy the faded women who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still below there, murmuring scandals and remi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">niscences and folly, and tapping away their lives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her choice of the apartments they presently took</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed the vehemence of her release. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms upon the very verge of the city; they had a roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">space and a balcony upon the city wall, wide open to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun and wind, the country and the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in that balcony comes the last scene in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. It was a summer sunsetting, and the hills of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Surrey were very blue and clear. Denton leaned upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balcony regarding them, and Elizabeth sat by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Very wide and spacious was the view, for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">balcony hung five hundred feet above the ancient level</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ground. The oblongs of the Food Company,</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken here and there by the ruins--grotesque little</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes and sheds--of the ancient suburbs, and inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sected by shining streams of sewage, passed at last into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a remote diapering at the foot of the distant hills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There once had been the squatting-place of the children</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Uya. On those further slopes gaunt machines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown import worked slackly at the end of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell, and the hill crest was set with stagnant wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanes. Along the great south road the Labor Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany's field workers, in huge wheeled mechanical ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hicles, were hurrying back to their meals, their last</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell finished. And through the air a dozen little pri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vate aeropiles sailed down towards the city. Familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene as it was to the eyes of Denton and Elizabeth, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have filled the minds of their ancestors with</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulous amazement. Denton's thoughts fl-uttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the future in a vain attempt at what that scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be in another two hundred years, and, recoiling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned towards the past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shared something of the growing knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time; he could picture the quaint smoke-grimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Victorian city with its narrow little roads of- beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, its wide common-land, ill-organized, ill-built</seg><seg type="columnLine">suburbs, and irregular enclosures; the old countryside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Stuart times, with its little villages and its petty</seg><seg type="columnLine">London; the England of the monasteries, the far older</seg><seg type="columnLine">England of the Roman dominion, and then before that</seg><seg type="columnLine">A STORY OF THE DAYS TO COME</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">147</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a wild country with here and there the huts of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">warring tribe. These huts must have come and gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and come again through a space of years that made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roman camp and villa seem but yesterday; and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">those years, before even the huts, there had been men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the valley. Even then--so recent had it all been when</seg><seg type="columnLine">one judged it by the standards of geological time--this</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley had been here; and those hills yonder, higher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, and snow-tipped, had still been yonder hills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Thames had flowed down from the Cotswolds</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sea. But the men had been but the shapes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, creatures of darkness and ignorance, victims of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beasts and floods, storms and pestilence and incessant</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger. They had held a precarious foothold amidst</seg><seg type="columnLine">bears and lions and all the monstrous violence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. Already some at least of these enemies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome. ...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time Denton pursued the thoughts of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacious vision, trying in obedience to his instinct to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find his place and proportion in the scheme.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has been chance," he said, "it has been luck. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come through. It happens we have come through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not by any strength of our own. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet ... No. I don't know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was silent for a long time before he spoke again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After all--there is a long time yet.

There was the usual preliminary</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk, after which the Baron went on:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I am very much pleased, my dear Alier, that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radiotomatic relay station on the Moon works so well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up to last night neither Flitternix nor I were sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could bridge the 60 million miles between Mars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Moon by wireless, but by means of our wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful ultra sensitive radio-active detector, we were en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abled to 'listen in' successfully. When I had finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking last night, it was about 9 P. M., your terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. We got our receiving instruments ready at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little over five minutes after 11 P. M.* I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear myself talking. The message which I had sent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few hours before had been faithfully recorded on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telegraphone wire of my Radiotomatic on the Moon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as soon as the automatic clock released the sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery, the vibrations carrying my voice were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled back to us over a distance of 60 million miles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we knew that you must have heard the message</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, for you are only 238.000 miles distant from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moon.

All this took place within our heads, and as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> * As radio waves travel at the speed of light, i.e., 186,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles a second, it took over S minutes for the radio impulses to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach Mars. Munchhausen therefore heard his talk S minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">later than Alier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I closed my eyes for a few seconds to test myself, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">music as well as the picture flashes persisted; I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">then that I did not hear the music with my ears, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the pictures with my eyes. I reasoned correctly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">both had their origin within my brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Before I had time to puzzle it out. we had entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the structure at the heels of our host. We passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a, magnificent archway, constructed entirely of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some transparent material, decorated in superb taste in</seg><seg type="columnLine">green, white and gold. One thing struck us immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately; the hallway appeared as light as day, but we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not see where the light originated. Later, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to find out about this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At the end of the hallway was a ponderous massive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">panel with a door-like appearance. It must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least 125 feet high and 30 feet wide. It looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much like cut glass with all its prisms and fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuts; we first thought it was glass, but when we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer to it we changed our minds, for we saw that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge thing was as flexible as a velvet portiere. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">our host was but 10 feet away from it, it suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazed forth in a brilliant golden light which seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from nowhere. Simultaneously the huge door,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for this is what it was, rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly up in the air just</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a theater curtain. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">host now entered into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large circular salon-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, followed reluctantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">by us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say reluctantly ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visedly.

The house in which we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a sort of executive mansion or palace, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room in which we were standing was what you might</seg><seg type="columnLine">call the Ruler's office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here I must stop again to advise you that it is ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely difficult for me to explain in existing terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms what we see, hear and feel, for everything on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars is so totally different from what we are accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed to on Earth, that my best comparisons with ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrial things must of necessity fall far short of actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions on Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, I will do my best to convey a true picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The thing that struck us with the greatest force at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first was that everything in this immense room appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent. The room, which is about 150 feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter, is about 60 feet high, with an immense golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent cupola forming the ceiling. The tables, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs, all the furniture, as well as all the objects for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had no names, seemed transparent. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls seemed transparent, as well as the soft, rug-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpets on which we walked. But the wonder was</seg><seg type="columnLine">centered not solely in the transparency of the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">material, but in the fact that it gave forth a soft, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Imagine a solid chair of glass, glowing in a mel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, white light--not a brilliant light--and you have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good idea of what we beheld. It struck us at once that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this wonderful material could be treated at will by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians; for, the luminous rugs on which we stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">were soft as velvet, while a desk-like object nearby</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed hard as steel. The next thing which attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of our attention were the luminous walls. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all paneled in a curious manner, and, were, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, transparent and luminous. Each panel had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast amount of small hexagonal plate-like facets ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged somewhat in honeycomb fashion. These hex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agonal cells were constantly changing in soft colors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the most unique, as well as pleasing, geometrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">designs in colors were thus unendingly produced. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fascinating sight, and we found it hard to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">our eyes from these walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At the far end of the room we noticed four Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians whom we recognized at once as females on ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of their mass of hair and their more delicate fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures. Their heads seemed somewhat smaller than</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of the males, but they appeared to dress exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the men, except that the color of their metallic look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dresses was of a much lighter shade. But it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much the 'girls' that drew our attention as what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were doing. We could not rid ourselves of the idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these females were some sort of secretaries to our host,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was manifest that they were 'working' at some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. They appeared to be working earnestly and dili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently, too, but there were no pencils, no books, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, no typewriters; in fact, there was nothing what-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">soever that a terrestrial secretary requires to get up her</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior's reports.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Each girl sat motionless in front of a small glass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like table which was entirely bare and flat, except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center, from which projected two small glass-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods, each about 4 inches high and as thick as a pencil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the top they bent over and formed a gooseneck</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing in the direction of the girls. The rods were</seg><seg type="columnLine">both pointed at their ends, and while one appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous, the other seemed dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The 'operators' were watching the point of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous rod intently, and the expression of their faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicated that they were reading something. Every once</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a while they seemed to relax and at that moment a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious white ray seemed to pass from the light point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rod into the point of the dark one. That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all we could see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "While we were still wondering our host motioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to sit down on the comfortable looking arm chairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These chairs, as already mentioned, appeared like trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent glass, but when we put our hands on them they</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt like satin and not at all hard or cold. The trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent seats, which had a moment before appeared as</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass, were soft and flexible as an air-cushion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremely comfortable. The only trouble with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs was that they were too big for us. Built for large</seg><seg type="columnLine">8-foot Martians, our feet hardly reached the floor, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we sat in the chairs just as children sit in big armchairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">--our backs resting against the inside back of the chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our legs and feet projecting straight out on the seat;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only then were we quite comfortable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This position, ridiculous as it doubtless was, evoked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint smile from our host, who sat down in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair in front of a large piece of furniture that was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross between a rectangular table and a flat-top desk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">garnished in its center with a huge birthday-cake-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair with 10 transparent and 10 dark glass-like can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dles, curved in gooseneck form.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our host then turned to us and looked us over long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and earnestly. His large, liquid blue eyes were won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful in their depth; in them shone a wisdom such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had never before beheld. His face had a very benev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">olent expression, and the features were clear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply defined. He appeared tremendously intellectual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet will-power and strength of character radiated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face in an amazing manner. We thought that at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last he was going to speak to us, but instead he motioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us to close our eyes, which we did. The following</seg><seg type="columnLine">then happened and I will describe it as well as I can.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No sooner had I closed my eyes than a clear picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Earth with its continents was flashed in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, just as if I had tried to think intently of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial globe, as it stands silhouetted against a dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. Then in quick succession followed our 'Inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar,' the Planet Mars, a picture of our capture by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Martians with their yellow rays and their floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortresses, then an exact picture of how we appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">at our landing on Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It then dawned on us that our host was 'talking' to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, not in words and not in a strange language, but mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion-picture-wise. We had experienced the first trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference of thoughts, and had understood everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">our host had 'said,', because he thought in pictures which</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARON MUNCHHAUSEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">151</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were perfectly familiar to us, not in words which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had no meaning for us! When there was a lull,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we opened our eyes in astonishment and blinked be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered into the smiling eyes of our august host. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed highly amused at our amazement and once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more he motioned to us to close our eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For the next hour or more we had our first lesson</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 'Martian.' In easy stages our host first flashed sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple pictures into our minds, which were then followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by scenes with various actions and explanations just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a moving picture scene, where the mind must infer</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the actors are saying to each other by the expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of their faces and their obvious actions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was a short pause, after which our host</seg><seg type="columnLine">launched into the 'Evolution of Mars.' We were first</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown how the planet, millions of years ago, was but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nebula floating in space and how the nebula slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a solid sphere. The early life of Mars was</seg><seg type="columnLine">then pictured, which must have been exactly like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution of our own Earth. We saw the prehistorical</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians with their clubs and stones, then we saw for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long period the slow evolution of Mars down through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ages till a civilization similar to that of present ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrial conditions was reached. There were the wars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barbarism and the thousand other evils exactly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">those experienced by man on Earth. Evolution, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, is the same throughout the Universe, given like</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As the story of the evolution went on we could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the Martian's small head and his small chest both</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept on increasing with each subsequent generation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were shown how big oceans and inland seas, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as vast rivers, dried up gradually, and how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole population turned into mechanics, electricians</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chemists. No true happiness and contentment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, seemed to exist on Mars until thought trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference was established, till gravity was conquered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">money was abolished. There had been wars and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders up to that period, but it seems that these three</seg><seg type="columnLine">achievements, apparently invented and originated at</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the same time, emancipated the race completely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As we found out later, this period was reached some</seg><seg type="columnLine">14,600 years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beginning with that period only did the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">really become great. We saw how in less than five</seg><seg type="columnLine">generations speech had been entirely abolished, it being</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to 'converse' over considerable distance by</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought transference. We were shown the evils of too</seg><seg type="columnLine">many languages and the race hatreds produced thereby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how finally one universal language was adopted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">all races and nations. We saw the abolition of presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dents and rules of small and big nations, and the inau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guration of a Universal Council and a Planet Ruler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both elected by popular votes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We witnessed how the once dense air became.thinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thinner and how fertile valleys turned into deserts</seg><seg type="columnLine">on account of lack of water. We saw the transmutation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the metals, as well as the transmutation of all other</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. Thus we were shown how iron or lead was</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into gold or copper, or into any other metal. Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">else how marbel or stone was turned into steel or gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other metals, the same as clay can already be turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">into aluminum on Earth to-day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''Simultaneously with these discoveries, we witnessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unlocking of atomic forces, which was the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">great Martian discovery in the final mastery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where extermination had stared the Martians in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face on account of their constantly decreasing water</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply, the new atomic engines, combined with the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quering of gravity, dispelled all fears for the future.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During the next few generations we were made to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creation of the monstrous waterways which not</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone were to bring water from the two poles, but also</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to irrigate existing agricultural districts as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as barren deserts. We saw how the Martians finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">harnessed the Sun and how the latter was now moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waters in the vast waterways, which you know as</seg><seg type="columnLine">'canals.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In quick succession we were then shown all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress and evolution on Mars during the last thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand years. I do not attempt to go into details here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you would surely not grasp the meaning. Neither do</seg><seg type="columnLine">I attempt at this time to explain all the wonders that</seg><seg type="columnLine">took place on Mars during the past 10,000 years, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause you would not understand most of it, precisely</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we did not grasp everything during our first 'lecture.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">It therefore becomes necessary to explain the wonders</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you by means of examples and comparisons with</seg><seg type="columnLine">existing terrestrial terms. This I will do during our</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay on this Planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After our host had concluded his first 'lecture' he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched our utter amazement with the benevolent smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fond mother will bestow on her four-year-old child,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after she had finished telling him a particularly interest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fairy story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After a short time we could understand him quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">well by his motions as well as by mere picture talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">without closing our eyes. He then made us understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he desired us to transfer our thoughts to him. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried the experiment, Flitternix first. He failed utterly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our host shook his head smilingly. Then I tried it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as the metallic-like cap, which one of the Martians</seg><seg type="columnLine">had placed on my head, made me too warm, I foolishly</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded to take it off. Of course our host smilingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me put it back again, and only then did I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member that he had shown us during our lecture that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought transference was impossible without the medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">um of the complex 'cap,' which I shall later describe</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I then proceeded to concentrate my mind and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking real hard of Flitternix and how he appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">just then. For some seconds I did not seem to be suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful, for our host looked blank. Finally, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">perspiration running down my forehead from the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed effort, the Ruler's face lit up and he pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">smilingly at Flitternix! I w'as much elated over this</seg><seg type="columnLine">success, my first transmission of thoughts, or rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thought! For a few minutes our host tried to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">us understand that it would take some days of prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tise before we could hope to 'talk' even by pictures, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps months before we could begin to actually 'talk'</seg><seg type="columnLine">in words without using our tongues or ears. He then</seg><seg type="columnLine">recommended that Flitternix and myself should prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tise as much as possible and should forget speech en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely. He also cautioned us that as all thought-trans</seg><seg type="columnLine">152</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mission took place through the medium of electricity, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was necessary that the flexible metallic cord hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our metallic-like caps should touch some conduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor, preferably the ground. As we could easily guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this was necessary in order to provide a return</seg><seg type="columnLine">circuit for the currents, we soon learned how to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">in contact with a conductor, when we wanted to trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fer our thoughts from one to the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As our host had to go to the other end of the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">just then, Flitternix and I tried thought transmission at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. We surprised ourselves by our success. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only could we 'talk' in pictures after a while, but almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once we were able to enunciate whole sentences. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, the unusual strain gave us a headache long be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore our host returned; but that was to be expected; we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never been used to such hard mental work, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood quickly that we would have to learn the art</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually by constant slow practise and by frequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting the brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As if our august host had divined the strain on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds during the past hour and a half, he immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to divert us, and he did this admirably by letting</seg><seg type="columnLine">us see for ourselves with our eyes, instead of with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However, we quickly began to understand and ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciate his wisdom in first giving us his historic lecture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because if he had not done this most of the things we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw during the next hour would have been meaningless</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us. Thus you will understand that what I am going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you now, including the explanations, did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">originate entirely in my own mind. Most of my ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planations arc, naturally, based upon that important</seg><seg type="columnLine">lecture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We followed our host outdoors, where we boarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">his private flyer. This machine was, of course, an anti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational flyer, propelled by atomic engines. It be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haved much like our own 'Interstellar,' that is, it had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings, nor planes, because it was not dependent upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. The gravitational attraction of Mars is neu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tralized by the atomic engine to a certain degree. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">more the gravity is neutralized the higher the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">rises. Now, in order to steer the flyer, an Emanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray is used. This ray is the joint product of several</seg><seg type="columnLine">elements not known on Earth; the nearest, although a</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor analogy, is found in your radium emanation, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter is several million times weaker than the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian Emanation Ray. This ray is projected into space</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of electricity and another source of energy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I shall term ION, as yet unknown on Earth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be described by me later. The Emanation Ray can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be stored just as electricity is stored in a storage bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery. When it strikes an immovable object it acts</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly as an oar does when it is used in 'pushing off'</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the dock, i.e., the boat will move away from land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So the Emanation Ray is used in controlling the hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zontal motion of the gravity-neutralized flyer, and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">its means, the latter can be guided in any desired di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our flyer was round in shape, resembling a disc,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and measured about 25 feet in diameter. It was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most 6 feet thick, and like most other things we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen on Mars, it was transparent. In the center was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome that looked like the conning tower of a submarine,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and a slender metallic pole extended from it almost 25</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet into the air. It branched out at the top into three</seg><seg type="columnLine">short brackets, at the end of each was a transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball about 10 inches in diameter. Between these balls</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Emanation Ray played, and the latter could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown at will into any direction desired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our flyer was an open one and not covered on top,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were two 'drivers'--which you probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">would call chauffeurs--one forward and one aft. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no steering wheels and no brakes, nor was there a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horn. The two drivers sat in transparent chairs, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike our own, and in front of them was a little round</seg><seg type="columnLine">tabTe with small key levers like 'listening in' keys on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">American telephone switchboard. That was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As soon as we were seated, our host sitting between</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, our 'drivers' pressed a lever or two, and we shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward with amazing speed. In a few seconds the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emanation Ray went into action, and we began to fly</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rather float in an easterly direction. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position of the sun, I concluded that it was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">'noon,' as the sun was about overhead; this must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in Flitternix's mind too, for presently he set his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chronometer to noon, which, of course, was a ridiculous</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to do, for we did not know if the Martians divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">their day into 24 hours or into 100 hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We were now floating some 1,500 feet up over what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we afterwards learned was the Martian National Capi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal, the 'city' of the Ruler.

Thought Transmission On Mars</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS still dreaming, lost completely in a blue cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pipe smoke when my electric chime, controlled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Western Union clock, which gets the o-xact</seg><seg type="columnLine">time hourly from the Naval Observatory, commenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sound the eleventh hour in its sonorous, vibrant voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the stroke of eleven--my headset had been already</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamped over my ears--the familiar high whistling</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound sung in my ears once more.

However, he had a little surprise for me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not speak; instead, without warning, there sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly broke into my ears the most amazing music a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortal has ever heard. The sound was so loud that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was actually forced to take the 'phones from my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and place them on the table, and I had to go to the far</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of my laboratory in order to hear the music at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And to think that I was listening to music which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">originated on Mars 60 million miles away! It was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most unbelievable! But there it was, filling up the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire room with the most delightful music. Sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">it sounded like an immense orchestra, then again like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cclestc instrument. At other times the music sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a 'cello mixed with a flute, immediately to change</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a mixture of an oboe and a cornet. Occasionally</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a sound like human singing, but altogether</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">different in quality and volume. Moreover, all' sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sustained; they never broke off sharply; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">music from one instrument seemed to melt into that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another without the slightest break. Imagine, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can, that you are listening to a violin which gradually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a most harmonious manaer, changes into a cornet</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a break! I had never been stirred so deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">by music in my life, and I have listened to exquisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">music in my day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For five minutes oi: more I listened, entranced; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the music gradually died down to a plaintive, crying</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound which almost brought tears to my eyes. W'hen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "concert" was over I returned to the 'phones and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had hardly adjusted them when Miinchhausen spoke:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good evening, my dear Alier, how is old Mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth and yourself to-night? Sorry you can't tell me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any rate I trust all is well! I hope you enjoyed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">little musicale; there has never been such music on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth as far as I know. Too bad the telegraphone wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the moon is so short, otherwise I would have given</seg><seg type="columnLine">you a longer program. Anyhow, I am certain you</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked my little concert. Of course, now that you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the Martian music, you want to know how it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced. If I were not so far famed for my veracity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should certainly run the risk of being called something</seg><seg type="columnLine">less well sounding than a story teller, but I know you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not question my statements. The indisputable facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">are that the music which you just heard was produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">154</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from a solid transparent tos rod, about Y\ inch thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost 8 feet high. At each end of this rod there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a coil which looks like a big terrestrial magnet coil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It has, however, about 14 distinct and separate windings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ends of these windings go to a sort of switchboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has a triple keyboard like an organ, and both coils</seg><seg type="columnLine">are connected to this organ-like instrument. By de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing a key, a certain pulsating current is sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">through one of the coils. This in turn sets up Eddy cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rents in the tos rod, which, of course, is conductive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These stresses in the rod set up vibrations and cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rod to swing like a piano string--sound is the result.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By using different frequencies, different sounds are</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced. When both coils are operated at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, interferences take place within the rod, causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound to change in its quality. Thus by operating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two coils while changing the current intensity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by using different amplitudes, almost every imaginable</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as unimaginable sound can be obtained. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus easy to imitate a cornet or a xylophone in their true</seg><seg type="columnLine">musical values. Nor is this all, for the rod can be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sing and trill, and it can be made to actually speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">words; a good player is able to imitate the spoken or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the singing voice of any living Martian equally as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a lifeless, black phonograph dise on earth can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to sing the most difficult aria.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nor does the wonder stop here.

Indeed, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">outdoor concerts on Mars are given by means of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single tos rod. In only one case have I seen two rods</seg><seg type="columnLine">operated simultaneously. The effect in this instance</seg><seg type="columnLine">was overwhelming; it was like listening to a thousand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man orchestra and to a dozen tenors, all going at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But this is not all.

Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio music is nothing new; the sounds of voices and</seg><seg type="columnLine">music have been wafted over thousands of miles on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth already, but your scientists still require huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">aerials with which to catch the waves. And these waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not yet themselves audible to our ears. You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">still using a variety of coils, detectors, telephone re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceivers and what not in order to translate these radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves into sound waves in order that your ear may</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so on Mars. Every Martian is required, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons which you will understand presently, to wear a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar soft metallic cap. From the back of the cap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin metallic cable runs down the Martian's back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">is fastened there to his metallic coat. All Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing, as well as footgear, is invariably of metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">weave. Now, since all pavements and all flooring, car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pets and rugs are metallic on Mars, for reasons which</seg><seg type="columnLine">will also be apparent to you later, a metallic connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the 'earth' or 'ground' is always effected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The metallic cable of which I just spoke does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">make contact with the cap itself, but it is insulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefrom. It connects, however, with a small reddish</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic plate about the size of an American silver dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar. This plate in turn, by means of a flat spring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">presses against the temple of the wearer; the cap holds</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plate in place. A similar plate presses against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other temple, but this plate, unlike the other, is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected metallicly to the cap itself. From this descrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion you will gather that the metallic cap performs the</seg><seg type="columnLine">function of a radio aerial, while the metallic clothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms the ground. The two reddish plates pressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the bare temples are made of two metals un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known on earth, and the metals are distributed over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the plate in honeycomb fashion without</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching each other. Now if the two plates are pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the temples and when wireless waves are pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through them, the waves are translated into vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of a certain frequency. It has been found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if these vibrations reach the conscious sense of hearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is located in the temporal lobe of the brain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds can be impressed upon the brain without re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiring the ear and its auditory nerve.

Our host immediately assumed an exceedingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave manner and motioned us to pay close attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We then witnessed a most astounding procedure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The ruler of the Planet Mars placed his finger upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a black button-like contrivance in front of him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly the transparent gooseneck tos rod in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the button changed its color and became almost milky</seg><seg type="columnLine">white. Simultaneously its upper sharp point began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow in a bluish white color and a faint discharge, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike tobacco smoke, struck our host squarely in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. This discharge was unlike any electrical high ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion phenomenon we had ever witnessed, for it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">transparent and it did not make the slightest sound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, it seemed to constantly undergo changes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few seconds the stream would be bluish white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly to change to a pinkish color during the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. Then again it would appear slightly violet</seg><seg type="columnLine">One moment it would spread out, the next it would look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a single beam of light.

At other times he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would nod as if he was giving his approval to some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing ; then again he would sway his head slightly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side to the other, but at all times while we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching him we could not rid ourselves of the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was 'reading' something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Indeed, as we were to find out later, this was pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisely what he was doing.

He 'dictated' for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes and when he had finished he pressed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second black button in front of the second goose</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck--he was now 'reading' his second letter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "For an hour or more he thus attended to his 'cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">respondence,' never slacking, never resting a minute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whatever the qualities of a Martian ruler are, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain that he must be energetic to the utmost, as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a quick worker.

A few hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of the dhow, Weyl and Mulgrave saw a globular</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey shape among the waves.

If I had, I would probably have fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in horror from the place. The Professor was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed in tinkering with the' mechanism of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine which had engrossed his interest for nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years, that he did not at first notice my entrance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I picked up a book lying open on a stand to one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. It was H. G. Wells' "The Time Machine."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I smiled at the absurdity of a great professor being</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in such truck. The Professor turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught me smiling. "Impossible fiction," I remarked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with what, God help me, was an illy-concealed sneer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fiction, yes," replied the Professor, "but why</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely you don't think there is anything possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this?" I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But to travel in something that has no reality!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What is reality ? The earth on which we stand ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sea on which we sail ? The air through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we fly? Have they any existence outside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attributes with which our senses endow them?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I can touch the earth," I protested, "I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel the sea, but I cannot touch or handle time."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Neither can you touch or handle space," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor dryly, "but you move in it: and if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to move through space, say from this spot to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the City Hall in Oakland, you would probably cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culate the journey took you fifty minutes of time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In that sense time would have a very real signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cance for you, and you would have moved in it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the extent of fifty minutes. But if I ask you why</seg><seg type="columnLine">it isn't possible to move ahead in time not fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, but fifty centuries, you consider me insane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your trouble is that of most people, my boy; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of enough imagination to lift your brains out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the accustomed rut."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps so," I replied, reddening angrily; "but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save in fiction, who has ever invented a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have," answered the professor. He smiled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my look of disbelief. "Now this thing," he added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">patting the mechanical creation affectionately, "is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Time Machine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the first time he had ever told me what</seg><seg type="columnLine">his invention was supposed to be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean it will travel into the future?" I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeptically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If my calculations are correct--and I have every</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to believe they are--then this machine will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take us into the future."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Us!" I echoed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked over and shut the door with a bang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have you any objections to taking such a trip?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"None at all," I lied, thinking the chances of doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so were very remote.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is splendid. Then there is nothing to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent our giving the machine a trial this afternoon."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The machine had two seats, with backs probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">two feet high. The Professor seated me in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, while he occupied the other. "Just as a pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution to keep you from falling out," he smiled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckling me in with a broad leather belt. In front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of himself he swung a shelf-like section of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus on which was arranged a number of dials</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clock-like instruments. In some respects--save</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the clocks--the shelf resembled the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a radio board. Whatever cogs and wheels there</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be were hidden in the body of the machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under our feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," said the Professor, indicating a dial, regis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters the years and centuries; the one next to it, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks, days and hours; and this handle," he touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">a projecting lever, "controls the machine." Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting down, he had lifted the bottom from his seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and revealed below it a hollow space filled with tools</seg><seg type="columnLine">and provisions. "It is the same with your chair,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said with satisfaction, "and if you examine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather belt, which holds you in, you will discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it also acts as the holster for a Colt automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a box of spare cartridges." He settled himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTER ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">161</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably in his seat and grasped the lever. "Are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you ready, my boy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So business-like was his manner, so self-assured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for a moment a qualm of doubt assailed me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What if the confounded thing were to work! Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">my commonsense got the upper hand again. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course it wouldn't! Already I began to feel sorry</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the professor. At my nod of assent, he pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the lever. The machine shook; there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a purring noise; but that was all. I smiled, partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with relief, partly with derision. "What's the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter?" I asked; and even as I spoke the whole room</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun like a giddy top and dissolved into blackness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The roaring of a million cataracts dazed and stunned</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. There was an awful sensation of turning inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, a terrible jolt, and then it was all over and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lying sprawled out and half senseless in a wreck</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disintegrating iron and steel. My first thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, was that we were still in the laboratory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The machine had turned over, or exploded, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly killed me. That's what came of listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bughouse professors and their crazy inventions!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt my head and limbs blindly. Sound enough, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, save for a few scratches and bruises. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled to sit up; as I did so, I came face to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an old man with a tangled mane of gray hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an unkempt beard. It was several minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I realized that I was looking at the professor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even as I did so, I became conscious of the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that black whiskers hung down on my own breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the top of my head was as bald as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">billiard ball. I looked around and saw that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying on a prairie-like expanse of country. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees were far off to one side and the immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain was covered with stunted bushes and tufts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass. Anything more different from the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not well be imagined. As I stared stupefied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet realizing the awful truth, the Professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a deprecating cough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid," he said in a voice that was his, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously changed, "I'm afraid I overlooked a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital thing." He shook his head. "How I was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupid as not to think of it, I can't understand."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Think of what?" I mumbled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of the almost elementary fact that as we jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neyed into the future our bodies would age."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIS words brought me to my senses. Incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it seemed, this was the future. At least we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to rest on some other spot than that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory. And undoubtedly physical changes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken place in the Professor and myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must return at once!" I cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," replied the Professor, "at once. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">how ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at him dumbly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you see," he remarked, picking up a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rusted, crumbling metal, "the machine just kept go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing until it was so old it fell to pieces. My boy, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had a lucky escape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A lucky escape!" I echoed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; for if the machine had not worn out when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did we would have gone on until we perished</seg><seg type="columnLine">from old age."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I thought you told me once that old age</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not caused by the passing of time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I did; but you can readily understand that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our journey through time we encountered more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less friction from environment. Of course the faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">we traveled through a century, say, the less action</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of environment on our bodies there would be in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">given period of time. But stil there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to age us after awhile. At least, such seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have been the case."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How far have we come?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know. All my instruments are destroyed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As you see, the machine is junk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we can build another."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What with?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I groaned. Machine, tools, weapons, all were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. God knows how many centuries in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future, we stood on a bleak prairie, middle-aged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">old, the rotting clothes falling from our backs, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">only our bare hands to protect us from whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangers might lurk for us in this new and unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. With despairing eyes I stood up and scanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon. "Look, professor, look!" I cried, seiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him by the shoulder. "Aren't those men running</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor focussed his eyes in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">my finger pointed. Perhaps a half mile away, hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing seemingly just topped a rise, was a body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what appeared to be men. Even at that distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about them looked peculiar; and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came nearer we saw that they were running</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bowed backs, their heads jutting at almost right</seg><seg type="columnLine">angles with their bodies, and their arms dangling</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosely in front of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those are the queerest looking men I've ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen," I said in alarm, looking around for a weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to defend myself with in case of attack, and pluck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up the only thing available, a piece of rusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron. The professor did likewise. Thus armed, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up to await their approach, for there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to hide,' and nothing behind which we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find shelter. Perhaps three hundred yards away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd men spread out into a semi-circle. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably twenty-five or thirty of them, naked, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even a breach-clout, shaggy of hair and beard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with hair almost as heavy as fur running down</seg><seg type="columnLine">their backs and on the weather sides of their arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and legs. They continued coming at a fast gallop;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but just when it seemed they would run on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over us, they reared back--much as do horses when</seg><seg type="columnLine">reined in--and came to an abrupt stop, shaking their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy manes, and pawing at the ground with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very peculiar; very peculiar indeed," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor thoughtfully. "Except for the clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">defined features of their faces and the general struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of their bodies, one would not take them for men</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They seem more like apes," I retorted. "I hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're not as savage as they look. Speak to them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor, before they start something, and see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can't talk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor held up one hand in a peaceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture and took a step forward. He raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice so as to make it carry across the thirty or</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty feet which still separated the shaggy men</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are American travelers!" he shouted. "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there any among you who can talk English ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only response to this was a snorting and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rearing, accompanied by a rustling sound which</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected the nerves disagreeably. Several of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaggy men broke from the circle, doing a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of plunging and rearing before reluctantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming back into formation again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By God, Professor," I said fervently, the goose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">162</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh appearing on my body, "I don't like this at all."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Professor repeated his question in French,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish, Italian; he asked it in Portuguese, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he later told me were several Indian dialects;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but all to no purpose. Only every time he paused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch his breath, there came that dry rustling as of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rasping of metal on metal. Suddenly he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and caught me by the shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those creatures," he whispered, gesturing towards</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shaggy men, "are controlled."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Controlled!" I exclaimed. "What do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That there is something on their shoulders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought the Professor was taking leave of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses. "What could it possibly be," I began, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, for the shaggy men were in motion. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided, one group going to the right of us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other to the left. In our rear they joined ranks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made us retreat before them. It was then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught my first glimpse of the unbelievable riders</seg><seg type="columnLine">that perched on their shoulders and rode them, much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as human beings ride horses. Long antennae reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on either side of the shaggy men's faces, grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping the corners of their mouths and serving to</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide them as with bit and bridle. Other antennae</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved in the air, or rubbed one on the other, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing the rasping noise which had so grated on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my nerves. The bodies to which these antennae were</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached were about a foot in length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the name of God, what are they, Professor?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I screamed, half raising my piece of iron as if to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw it at the slowly advancing horrors. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor gripped my arm. "Don't start fighting,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he warned sternly, "unless you have to. As to what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are, I'm not certain, but I believe them to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of ant-like insects."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We retreated, slowly at first, then at a brisk</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk, finally at a trot. When we moved in a given</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction the insects were content to keep their steeds</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a distance; but when we veered from it they</seg><seg type="columnLine">urged on the shaggy men to head us off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I believe those insects are driving us in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as men herd cattle," gasped the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We topped a rise and saw stretching away before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us a level plain. Far out on this plain--several</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles away, perhaps--were numerous mounds, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did not take us loi.g to suspect that they were our</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination. Several times the Professor sank to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, utterly winded, unable to run another step.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At such times, I stood over his body with my iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">club, determined to sell our lives dearly, but' there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no need to fight. The shaggy men were brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a halt and their uncanny riders waited patiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the Professor could regain his feet, when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were once more urged ahead at a brisk pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Night had fallen and it was almost too dark to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see when we finally staggered through a narrow gap</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a large enclosure and were left to our own de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vices. The splash of water led us to a stream, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">we slaked our thirst and bathed our sore and swollen</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet; and then, too miserable and tired to care what</seg><seg type="columnLine">further happened to us, we huddled together for</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth and fell asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Master Ants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SEVERAL hours later, the Professor and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">awoke, chilled to the bone. And no wonder!</seg><seg type="columnLine">For we were practically naked, only shreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cloth clinging to our backs. The moon was rid</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing high overhead, making the enclosure as light</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as day. Now and then the silence would be broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shrill scream or a heavy snort. Once or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice we heard the metallic slithering of antennae;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and once, in looking up, I saw an insect crawling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of a mound, its sinuous body etched sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the sky. I shivered with more than the cold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Professor," I whispered, "is this a nightmare or</seg><seg type="columnLine">am -I really awake?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm very much afraid that both of us are wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">awake," said the Professor with a sigh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it doesn't seem possible," I exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Those bugs . . . My God, Professor, what has hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to the world!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor pulled thoughtfully at his unkempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard. "I don't know. In our day there were sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">entists who held insects to be a growing menace to</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's rule. Perhaps . . . But you could see for</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself that those ants rode men!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Were they men?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes; I believe they were."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But their hair?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Could be accounted for by the fact that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were exposed, naked, to all kinds of weather. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit. in this case, the strong, hairy ones, would survive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and breed. A few centuries of such breeding could</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly produce the type we saw."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought of a world in which insects were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominant species and men subject to them as beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of burden, filled me with horror. If such were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, what would our fate be? In spite of the chill</seg><seg type="columnLine">night wind, in spite of the fact that we were cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hungry, I dreaded the morning. But daylight</seg><seg type="columnLine">came at last, and then we were better able to exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine our surroundings. The enclosure was probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half mile square and fenced in with an irregular</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of mounds anywhere from ten to twenty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">high. Across the stream from us, bedded against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls of a mound, were several hundred of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaggy men. Soon after daylight they were afoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and came down to the stream to drink, wading into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water, in some cases, up to the waist, and drink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with an animal-like abandonment that filled me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with disgust. It couldn't be possible that those crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures had once been human beings like the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor and myself. No, no! It seemed incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mankind could ever have fallen so low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the shaggy men crossed the stream to</seg><seg type="columnLine">view us more closely. Most of these were females,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooping forward as they walked. One of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">came quite close to us, uttering plaintive cries, -and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor stepped forward in an attempt to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her. At this a great hulking bull of a fellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fiery red hair that glinted in the sun, and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have stood well over six feet if he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened up. rushed at the Professor with a roar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The latter retreated hastily; whereupon the leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the herd--for you could have called the gather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of shaggy men nothing else than a herd, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-haired giant the leader of it--turned upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">females, and with blows of his fists and sundry</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicks of his splay feet, drove them back across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream where they all, men, women and children,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took to grubbing in the ground for some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">roots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you call them human," I said to the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They once were."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head. "Those creatures are bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost double. Even the children are so formed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the posture seems a natural one to them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTER ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">163</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps they were bred for that characteristic."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bred!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not? If things are as I suspect, then those</seg><seg type="columnLine">men have become the domestic animals of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects. In the beginning they were probably bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">double by bearing the weight of their riders. Ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired characteristics are, of course, generally con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceded to be uninheritable, but little is known of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities of variation--what effects the constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing of a thing may have on the germ-plasm. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible that mutations with certain peculiarities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure were born and men, such as you see, bred</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before I could make reply, we had our first leis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urely view of one of the ant-like insects. It sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly appeared on top of a ten-foot mound a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards from where we stood. Its body was in three</seg><seg type="columnLine">segments of an almost metallic blackness, being</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised, on stilted feet, about eight inches from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Four feelers, or antennae, waved in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">or rasped one on the other, and were- attached to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobile head. There was no 'indication of eyes, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weird thing paused in one spot for all of five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, as if intently regarding us, and I, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, believed that it could see. Other insects ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared on the mounds, and soon the air was full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metallic slithering. At the sound, the males of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shaggy herd pricked up their ears, stamped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground with their feet, and then continued feeding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the other hand, the females ran towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounds, stretching up their hands to the insects</seg><seg type="columnLine">on top of them, and calling out with imploring cries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we witnessed a strange sight. The ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled down the wall in one stream, paused beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">a female for a moment or two, and then crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the wall again in another. It was a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the reason for this dawned on me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord, Professor!" I exclaimed suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"they're milking them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was true. The females of the shaggy men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many cows being milked. Again the horror of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our position came over me. We were castaway in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">future age where man no longer was lord and mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. Instead, he was a beast to be driven like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse, milked like a cow, and--since-ants ate meat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or used to--slaughtered like an ox. I wiped the cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat from my forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Professor," I said, "we must escape from here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," replied the Professor; "but how--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and where to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no answer to make. The mounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemmed us in; and even if we could get beyond them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and away from our present captors, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtless other mounds and other insects who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture us. If the world was really in the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants, then we were animals to be hunted down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tamed or killed. This age into which we had blun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered was not safe for man--at least, not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized man. I closed my eyes to shut out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible sight of crawling insects. I tried to shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ears to the sound of insane slithering, but heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily enough when the Professor said somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously, "My boy, I believe they're coming over</seg><seg type="columnLine">here." Three of the ants had mounted on the backs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shaggy men and were trotting them towards us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked desperately around for my piece of iron.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was gone. So was the Professor's. Someone or</seg><seg type="columnLine">something had removed them while we slept. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there anything else that could be used as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon. In this dilemma we turned and ran, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were soon overtaken. Two of the shaggy men closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in on me, while the third held the Professor power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. I fought like a fiend; but the four hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shaggy men were like iron bands, the grip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fingers like vises. In a few minutes I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless. Then came the crowning horror. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insects dismounted from the back of its steed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and climbed on mine. At the feel of its suction-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like legs on my flesh I went crazy. The muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhed in horrified protest under my skin. I bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and screamed and lashed out with my feet. All to</seg><seg type="columnLine">no avail. Relentlessly, the loathsome thing clam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered upwards until it had settled itself firmly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck and shoulders. Two antennae reached down</seg><seg type="columnLine">my cheeks, gripping the corners of my mouth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamping themselves there. Almost at the same in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant the shaggy men loosed their grip of me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 was free. For a moment I stood still, dazed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling; then the antennae gave a pull at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, wrenching the head back with a cruel jerk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a scream of pure terror, I plunged forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a mad leap, clawing upwards with my hands at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the awful incubus on my shoulders, tearing futilely</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the antennae which gripped my mouth. And as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fought to unseat the inhuman rider perched on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulders, I knew what I was: I was a horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">being broken, a wild mustang, knowing for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the torture of bit and saddle, of spur and quirt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was an inferior animal being conquered, beaten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained by a superior one. The blind, unreasoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear I felt, a thousand wild horses being brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the yoke of all-powerful man must have felt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ran--it seemed for ages--goaded, spurred, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could run no more. My gait slackened, became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trot, a walk. Finally I stood still, frothing blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saliva at the mouth, gulping painfully for air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling in every limb. The incredible insect</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed me for a few minutes before again urging</seg><seg type="columnLine">me into a trot. I made no protest. I was beaten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowed. The antenna on the left pulled; I went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left. The one to the right tugged; I went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. My rider drove me past mounds where ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">perched watching, much as cowboys of the past were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wont to straddle corral fences and observe one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their number perform. They slithered what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">undoubtedly their applause. For about twenty min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes I was put through my paces; made to walk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">canter, circle, wheel and stop at command. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insect slid from my shoulders and I sank to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, too miserable and distraught to care whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">I lived or died. I flinched and closed my eyes when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it patted me with its antennae and slithered sooth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, much as a man might pat a horse and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time say, "There, there, old boy, don't be afraid."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Afterwards a quantity of raw vegetables and what</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared to be coarse grain cakes were tossed to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the insect went away. I lay there for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, hardly stirring a finger, when the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up and sat down beside me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "No," he said, "they didn't ride me. Too old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He picked up a grain cake and gnawed at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Try one. my boy, they're not half bad. Besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll feel better if you eat something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I suppose it seems queer to tell it. but we sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">there on the rough grass, with the slithering ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming and going about their business, and ate those</seg><seg type="columnLine">cakes. Neither one of us had tasted food since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day before--or was it several centuries before?--</seg><seg type="columnLine">164</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and were half starved. Only hunger could make</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating at all bearable with my sore and lacerated</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. Suddenly the Professor spoke to me in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd tone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear boy, I don't like to arouse any false</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes, but will you take a look at that thing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and tell me what you think it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced up apathetically enough; then at sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what I saw I leaped to my feet with a wild cry;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, soaring through the air at a height of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy feet from the ground was a craft of shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An airship!" I shouted deliriously. "An air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">2450 A.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YES, it was an airship. There could be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt of that. And where there was an air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, there must be human beings, men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Then civilized people are still living on the earth,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried the Professor exultantly. "Quick, my boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout and attract the driver's attention."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no need to urge me. Pain, weariness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair were forgotten as I waved madly. "Help!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shouted, dancing up and down. "Help!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strange craft jerked to a pause in mid-air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung motionless for a moment, then sank directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthwards for what must have been forty feet or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. Over the side looked a girl, her beautiful face</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing a look of amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For God's sake, help us!" I shouted again, "or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ants . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I got no further, fear throttling my voice, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants were coming. Thousands of them suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in sight, literally covering the tops and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of the mounds. They saw the airship; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be no doubt of that. A half million antennae</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached threateningly heavenwards, and the angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">slithering of them appalled the ears. The woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted something, what I could not hear, and waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand. Even as some of the insects surged</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from the mounds and made for us, the airship</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped. It was a close thing. We leaped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched the metal sides, hanging on with the grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of desperation, as the strange craft brushed the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a feather and soared aloft again. I felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucking claws of an insect fasten to one leg and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked out in a vain endeavor to rid myself of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly a withering ray flashed from a cone in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's hand and played on the insect. There was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">acrid smell of burning, a little flash of light, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grip on my leg relaxed. With a sob of relief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stumbled over the side of the car and fell in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap on the floor. "Safe, my boy, safe!" exulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor, who had preceded me; then, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the girl, who was regarding us with wide-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder, he asked, "What year is this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "2450," she answered in perfect English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A.D. ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hum," muttered the Professor, making a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental calculation. "Five hundred and twenty-fiv&lt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">years in the future."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I was too busy adjusting myself to this sud</seg><seg type="columnLine">den change in our fortunes to give him much heed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Far below us the earth was unrolling like a checkereu</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpet, mounds, hillocks, trees sweeping by at con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable speed. What power was driving the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. I wondered. There was no sign of a propeller;</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither did the craft possess wings and a rudder;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nor any of the other properties associated in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind with flying machines. Only the girl stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of a square box and now and then shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small lever. She was, I judged, twenty-one or two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with red-gold hair, eyes like slanted almonds, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin of yellow ivory. Her lithe body was of medium</seg><seg type="columnLine">height and clad in a loose-flowing robe of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecarlct-colored material.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are we going?" I asked her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "To the Castle," she answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As she regarded me, I realized for the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was naked; but the Professor seemed bliss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully unconscious of the lack of any clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have to thank you for rescuing us from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very dangerous and awkward position," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">courteously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I took you for beast men at first," she replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and if you hadn't called out in English, I shouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have stopped. Tell me, where do you come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how did you fall into the hands of the Master</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ants?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We came from the past," replied the Professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and landed on the plain about seven miles from</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you picked us up. The insects--what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">call Master Ants--captured us there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The past?" questioned the girl. "Where is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ? Over the sea ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," answered the Professor. "In.another age,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an earlier one than this. Out of the past, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The girl didn't know. She stared at the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if she thought the hardships we had undergone</seg><seg type="columnLine">had unbalanced his mind. As for me, I was content</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sink into a seat and wonder what kind of place</seg><seg type="columnLine">was this Castle she was taking us to, and what</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of people were they who inhabited it in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">year of our Lord, 2450. I had not long to wonder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About an hour's flight brought us in sight of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast structure which crowned the top of a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill. Its walls glittered like dull silver under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays of the afternoon sun, and its roof seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">one large garden or park. Never had I seen any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing more beautiful or bizarre. Here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">domes of silver towered among swaying palm trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spruce and live oak. The car swooped down like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">homing bird and came gently to rest on a wide plaza</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was immediately surrounded by a crowd of curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous people of all ages and both sexes. The women</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clad in gay-colored dresses; the men wearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">white trousers, with soft linen tunics. Both men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women went bareheaded and barefooted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men were clean-shaven. At sight of us, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and children fell back with cries of alarm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and some of the men made as if they would attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">us forthwith; but the girl cried out that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not beast men, but English-speaking travelers whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had rescued from the Master Ants. At this</seg><seg type="columnLine">announcement hostility ceased, but the amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which we were regarded deepened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "How is this possible ?" said one handsome young</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow. "Save for ourselves, there are no English-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking people left alive in the two Americas, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for three hundred years no word has come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe. The Master Ants rule this country, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps the world. Where, then, could these men</seg><seg type="columnLine">have come from unless it be from the ranks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast men?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are Time Travelers," began the Professor;</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we come from . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a tall, commanding man of about sixty in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrupted him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTER A^TS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">165</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Our guests are worn and weary.

It is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hard to tell of the exquisite enjoyment of the next</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">few hours. We were led into a central roof build-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing of dull silver and bathed and washed. Soothing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lotions were applied to my wounds. Our bodies</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were anointed with refreshing balms and swathed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in soft robes. Tangled beards were clipped to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">skin and our faces shaved. After all these minis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trations, I glanced in a mirror and saw the reflected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">features of a man of about forty-odd, bald of head,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yet not entirely unreminiscent of the youth I once</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had been. Food was served to us as we lay on soft</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">couches. First a thick broth, aromatic, satisfying;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then various dishes whose names I did not know;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but all were palatable. After eating, we fell asleep</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and slept, we discovered later, until eight o'clock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the next morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Science Castle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITHOUT a doubt, our couches had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosed by four walls when we fell asleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What miracle was this? We were lying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an open space with only some green shrubbery be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween us and the wide plaza on one side, and walks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gardens on the other three. Children were romp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the plaza, evidently laughing and shouting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet their voices came to us but faintly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I suppose we're not dreaming," said the Pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fessor. He got up and took a few steps forward;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then came to an abrupt halt. "This is very odd,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he said; and even as he spoke, the four walls magic-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ally enclosed us, the Professor standing with his face</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against one of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Good morning," said a laughing voice. 1 for-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">got your room was to be left opaque and turned on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ray."	.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was the handsome youth who had questioned us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the day before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The ray?" asked the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh, I forgot!" exclaimed the youth. "Every-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing is probably strange to you.

"Why I don't know</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I can tell you, offhand." He scratched his head</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in perplexity. "I guess it's like electricity used to be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Thousands of people turned it on every day, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nobodv could tell you what it was."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We dressed ourselves in white trousers and soft</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tunics of a fair fit and followed him to a central</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dining room.

There were some with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the slanted eyes and yellow skin of the Chinese;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">others, plainly, had more than a drop of negro blood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in their veins; yet all were mingling with their white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">companions on terms of perfect equality. In Science</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Castle, I was to learn later, no distinction was made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as to race or color. Among the early inhabitants had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been numbered Japanese, Negroes, and Chinese, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">well as whites. A common foe, a common vital</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">danger had served to weld the various strains to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gether. "Race and color antagonisms," a Scientian</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">told us, "would have proved fatal to the small com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">munity. Of necessity a mingling of races took</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">place/ My grandfather was a negro. The girl who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rescued you has Chinese blood in her veins. What-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever differences existed among our people in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">early days has been ironed out by centuries of a com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mon culture and environment."

After eating, we repaired to the plaza</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">where several hundred people were gathered, seated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the grass or on rustic benches. Seats were given</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us on what was evidently the raised platform of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speaker's rostrum. The tall, elderly man who had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spoken for our welfare the night before, received</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us kindly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My name," he said, "is Soltano, Director of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Science in Science Castle.

However, you must realize that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it has been centuries since strangers like yourselves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have entered Science Castle, and understand that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your rescue and coming has caused us untold amaze-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment.

A little of your curiosity, I can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">understand, and shall do my best to satisfy it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He had raised his voice so that the words might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">carry to the people below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There is no need to pitch your voice above its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ordinary key," explained Soltano. "This rostrum is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">really an instrument which broadcasts and magnifies</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it.

"Some sort of an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">amplifying, radio machine, I see." He beamed on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Soltano. "I merely talk to you, is that it? and all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will hear." For a moment I thought he was going to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">interrupt the interview long enough to examine the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">platform; but if he wanted to do so, he conquered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the temptation. "My name," he said, "is John</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Reubens, late Professor of Physics at the University</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of California, and this lad here is Raymond Bent, my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">secretary.

"This is a strange</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing you are telling us, John Reubens," he said at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">last, "and well-nigh incredible.

He then proceeded to tell of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building of the Time Machine, of our incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush through space and of our awakening in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. Then he told of our subsequent capture by, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiences with, the insects. When he had finished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited talking and gesturing broke out among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people below. Evidently there were doubting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thomases among them, who discounted our story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the Professor was not disturbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "If you are amazed at what I have told you," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said, "how much more amazed are my companion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and myself to find ourselves in a future where ants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ride men as steeds and human beings live penned in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such a castle as this. Such a state of affairs was not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">even dreamed of when we left our own day and age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Naturally we are curious to learn how it has come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">f&lt;/'"'\UR historians are not quite clear as to that,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">replied Soltano. "If you came through time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from 1926, then you left your period nine years be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fore the ants began their attack on mankind. It was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in 1935 that the papers printed news of a queer hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pening in South America. Natives came fleeing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the jungles with stories of how the white ants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were eating everything up in the forests--even men!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In the United States no one paid much attention to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the news. The world, at that time, was in a state of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">political unrest and the government and people were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">watching Europe and building up a great air force,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they were too busy to give heed to preposterous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yarns emanating from Latin America. A year later</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the newspapers again flamed into headlines with news</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from Argentina, Peru, and Brazil. Small towns in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the interior of these countries were being devastated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It had always been known that termites would de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stroy things carelessly left exposed in the fields or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jungles; but now they were eating up brick and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stone. Buildings collapsed at the touch of a hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Men woke and turned to wake a sleeping companion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who dissolved into dust at a pressure. Sunday sup-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plements carried lurid stories and sensational pic-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tures for the edification of their readers. Then all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such nonsense was swept into oblivion by the fact</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that Poland declared war on Lithuania, Russia</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moved to intervene, and Italy and France came to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">death-grips for five bloody years. In the United</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">States_ ensued what were called prosperous times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Munition factories provided well-paid work for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thousands of workers and made millions of dollars</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for hundreds of millionaires. Everybody was busily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">employed and had no time to think of crazy happen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ings reported from crazier spiggoty republics. Only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a few scientists from the Smithsonian and other in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stitutes went down to South America to investigate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and wrote back long reports which were read with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">foreboding by a few learned men and ignored by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">everybody else. The papers they wrote--the records</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of those days--are preserved in our library."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the Master Ants," asked the Professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"where did they come from, and how did they over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelm the United States ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Soltano waved his hand. "I am coming to that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Master Ants were first noticed six years after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the depredations of the white ants commenced. How</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they came nobody knows. Only in the nests of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">termites, m the little galleries and chambers under-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ground, something stupendous was taking place,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something fraught with disaster for the human race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">During thousands of years the white ants had un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly been changing, evolving, acquiring, God</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only knows, what knowledge. It is all speculation, of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">course, but you doubtless recollect how the bees, by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feeding their larvae different foods, will produce at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will a queen, a drone, or a worker. Well, the white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ants had discovered how to make such food--and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to feed it to their larvae. At any rate, the Master</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ants appeared. No one had ever seen them before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They swarmed down from the jungles by the hun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dreds of thousands, and wherever they went the peo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ple were stricken and fell in the fields and the streets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We now know that the termites bit them, injecting a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">subtle poison into their systems which induced a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">species of paralysis; but at the time it was only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">known that of every three that fell, two were de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">voured, and that the third one recovered, stupid,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beast-like, to become the creature of the Master</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ants. In vain the southern republics sent their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soldiers to battle the insects. Guns crumbled to pieces</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in their hands. Armies lay on the ground to bivouac</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and_ only one soldier out of every three ever rose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">again--and he rose to bear an ant on his shoulders</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and chase his fleeing countrymen. Panic spread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Natives fled to the seashore and put to sea in all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">kinds of unseaworthy crafts--only to drown by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thousands. When the Master Ants finally occupied</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the crumbling ruins of Rio de Janeiro, the whole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world was forced to realize that something terrible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was happening in South America; and when fifteen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">years later, all South America having come under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their sway, the termites were reported to be making</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inroads on the Canal Zone, a feeling of uneasiness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swept through the people of the United States. Still</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it seemed impossible that the mighty northern nation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could be invaded and flouted by such an insignificant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing as an ant. Newspapers ran articles written by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">government experts, pointing out how absurd it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to even entertain the thought. South America had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">succumbed, said the experts, because she had been a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tropical wilderness without proper chemical defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Elaborate plans were drawn up, showing how the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">border states were protected from invasion by sys-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tems of pipes and sprays; showing how fleets of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">airship were prepared to drop tons of chemicals and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">explosives. Only the scientists who had studied the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tactics and methods of the ants knew how futile</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">these preparations were; but they and their sug-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gestions were ignored by the petty politicians and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nincompoops who were directing the affairs of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soltano paused. I stared at him, wide-eyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the ants came," breathed the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, the ants came. Millions of them were killed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with explosives, with gases and poisonous chemicals,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but their numbers seemed as exhaustless as the sands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the seashore. In the space of a year they ate up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the pipes and put the sprays out of commission. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you will have to read the history of those times for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a more detailed account. Then you will learn how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the United States soldiers marched against the in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vaders and met the same fate as had previously be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fallen the armed forces of South America and .Alex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTER ANT'S</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">167</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ico. The scientists had suggested that the soldiers go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mailed in a composite metal they had made from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blend of three other metals, comprehensive experi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ments having shown it to be the only substance the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ants could not devour. Guns, pipes, everything pos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sible, they said, should be protected with a casing of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this metal. No one paid any attention to them. Re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">buffed, a group of them interested financial backing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and retired to this hill. Here they congregated ma-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chines and workers and started building the castle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you now see. It was intended at first for an observa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion base, mbrelv; an outpost, as it were, from which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to spy on and study the habits of the insects. But as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the years passed, and it become increasingly clear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the country was doomed, the place became</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thought of as a permanent home and refuge. Com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">menced in 1955, it was not finished until the year</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">2000. For some reason the ants were, comparatively</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speaking, slow in infesting North America. Per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">haps the cooler climate had something to do with this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">For instance, they swept through south Texas and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all of the southern states before they fared further</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">north. _ When their coming finally drove the inhabit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ants of this vicinity panic stricken before them, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scientists--those of them who still lived--entered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Castle, accompained by the workers and their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">families, and we, whom you see today, are their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">descendents."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But the rest of the people!" cried the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"What became of them ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They went crazy with fear," replied Soltano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"For fifty years the United States was increasingly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the habitat of terrified mobs. The economic life of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the country became disrupted. Citizens, white and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black, fled from the southern states and added to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">congested panic of northern cities. Famine raised</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">its gaunt head: crime became prevalent. Hundreds</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of thousands died of hunger, of disease epidemics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Those who could beg, borrow or steal a passage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">abroad, fled to Europe, to Asia. Out of what was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">estimated to be a population of a hunderd and twenty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">millions in 1935, only seven millions were living in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">America when the ants turned north."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now?" asked the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In the whole western hemisphere there are prob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ably a few hundred thousand beast men bred by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Master Ants for food and transportation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I stared at the Professor with horror. Only yes-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terday, it seemed, we had left a populous, thriving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">America. Great industrial cities had sent their smoke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and ash into the sky; giant locomotives had carried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thousands of people on two ribbons of steel over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thousands of miles of country; and now . . . now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">. . . it was all as if it had never been. Could it be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possible that five hundred years had dissipated an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">empire ? Five hundred years !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," said Soltano; "enough of such matters</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the nonce. You will learn more of us as the days</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pass, as you become better acquainted with us in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dividually."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He led the way down into the plaza where we were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">immediately surrounded by the crowd and warmly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">greeted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Soltano Tells of the Progress and Danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Age</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I stepped down from the rostrum on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that first day in Science Castle, it was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet the girl who had rescued the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and myself from the Master Ants. Her name was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda. If anything, she looked more beautiful than</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did the day before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You have gone through much danger, Raymond,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said shyly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It was worth it, if it brought me to you," I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied ; and meant it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She did not seem displeased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is the hour for bathing. Let us go to the pool."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked around for the Professor; but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking away with a group of elderly Scientians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were evidently bent on entertaining him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Very well," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The pool was an artificial pond perhaps fi fty yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">square. I plunged after her into the pool. When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew myself, panting, out of the water at the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the pond, it was to find myself sprawling be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the handsome lad who had called me to break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. His name, I learned, was Servus, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda's twin brother. Their parents, he informed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, were both dead. Theda and he were enthralled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my accounts of the life and customs of 1926.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the time we were ready to dress for lunch, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of us were firm friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the days that followed, I learned a great deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Science Castle and its inhabitants. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda and Servus I walked the parapets which</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled the roof of the Castle and looked down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep sides that fell a sheer eight hundred feet before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they touched earth. From the foot of the Castle, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lull sloped away. To the east, as far as the eye could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, stretched a level waste; and to the northwest lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">a range of somber hills. On the plain, twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet below, grew nothing green. The sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded me of something about which I had won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered more than once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "How do you get water ?" I asked Servus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In the early days," he replied, "we relied on</seg><seg type="columnLine">wells, boring as deep as four thousand feet; but two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years ago they began to fail us. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a terrible time, I believe, when we were faced with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a water famine. Efforts were made to bring water</seg><seg type="columnLine">from distant lakes, but without success. Then just</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time, our chemists discovered how to make water."</seg><seg type="columnLine">''Make water!" I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  'Yes, from hydrogen and oxygen, you know. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the water we use is manufactured and stored in</seg><seg type="columnLine">great tanks far down in the depths of the Castle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from whence it is raised by means of force pumps."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"\\ onderful," I said, marveling at such ingenuity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But wonderful things were what one learned to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect at Science Castle. For instance, the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I were invited one day to be present at a history</seg><seg type="columnLine">review to be given to the children of the Castle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the classrooms were made transparent bv</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of the ray and there was all the illusion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being outdoors. Highly perfected projecting devices</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed moving pictures depicting the building of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Castle. It made me gasp with awe when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that the opening reels of this stupendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture had been taken five hundred and fif-teen years</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. One saw the motor caravan of scientists and</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers coming to the hill and watched breathlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the earth was broken by great steam-shovels. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the vast walls of the Castle growing upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot by foot, and finally the finished structure being</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished and stored with all the myriad inventions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and devices of the twentieth and twenty-first cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies. In the same manner we were shown how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Castle was enlarged in 2075. Workers sheathed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">protecting metal armor lab'ored to raise walls. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">168</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">these walls were finished and floors installed, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scoured with flaming rays which hardened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal and destroyed whatever insect life might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten inside them. So inch by inch we watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictured story of how the Castle had grown to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">present proportions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some moving picture," I breathed to the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor. ''What a knockout that would be for Cecil</seg><seg type="columnLine">B. DeMille! Did you notice the scene where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic stricken people rushed by pursued by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants?" I shuddered. "And the one where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists and workers were hoisted up the walls into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Castle? What I can't understand is why the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants couldn't have swarmed over the walls and wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone of them out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soltano overheard me. "Because," he replied, "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls were electrified. Nothing could have lived on</seg><seg type="columnLine">them after the current was turned on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About a week after this the Professor and I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken into the body of the Castle proper. Far down</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the fairy-like buildings and blooming gardens</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its roof, were the machine-shops, the laboratories</seg><seg type="columnLine">which made possible the pulsing life above. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw great dynamos and whirring machines at</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose functions I could not even guess. In one vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">room men were putting the finishing touches to what</seg><seg type="columnLine">were evidently a number of airships; in another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers were manufacturing crude oils and thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">greases. Whole floors were given over to experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental and research work of too complicated a na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture for me to attempt to describe. The Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enthralled. He was in his element here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated to go on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you do for metal ?" he asked suddenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Iron, tin, zinc?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hemmed in as we are," replied Soltano, "suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficient metal has always been difficult to obtain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, we have managed it. A great deal of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks, wheels, shafts, and so forth, are made from</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulp, from trees grown in the gardens above, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even from vegetable tops, leaves and vines which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated by a chemical process we have discovered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve our purpose very well. Iron is the one metal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, for which wc must mine. In those hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">north-west of us are old mines which we still work</seg><seg type="columnLine">when ore is needed. The work is hard and danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous. The men engaged at it must go clothed in pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tecting metal and be constantly protected with flam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rays. However, some day when ore is needed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may go with us in the airships and see the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">process for yourself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dismissed the subject hastily, evidently having</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of further interest to show us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," he said, pointing to great metal tanks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mass of complicated pipes and whirring wheels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"is where the water is made."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pressed a button. The walls surrounding us</seg><seg type="columnLine">became transparent, and looking out we could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brown slope of the hill. Suddenly I focussed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my gaze. About twenty feet from where we stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a small mound. Something behind it stirred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I caught a glimpse of a metallic bodv, of waving</seg><seg type="columnLine">antennae. "Yes," said Soltano, "it is a Master Ant;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are all around us. But I did not bring you down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show you them; I am going to show you some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing far more deadly." He guided us into a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift. "Under us, the foundations of the Castle sink</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the ground for a hundred feet. It is where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacture the composite metal when needed." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift sank silently into blackness; the noise of clanging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery above grew fainter, seemed farther away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost ceased. We stepped forth into a wilderness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of massive columns. Soltano pressed the now fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar button and the walls faded. We could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black earth beyond them, and even, it seemed, a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two into it. Something gray out there was mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and turning along little runways and tunnels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Millions and millions of tiny things were ceaselessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">burrowing and gnawing. For a moment I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand, then Soltano spoke and enlightenment</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to me. There were the termites--the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      EHOLD the enemies we fight," said Soltano</seg><seg type="columnLine">13 solemnly. "The insects out there are far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more dangerous to us than the Master Ants, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">creators they are. Those termites are seeking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">demolish the very foundations on which the castle</seg><seg type="columnLine">rests by eating away the earth from under them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I felt the gooseflesh rise on my skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three times in the last one hundred years have</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to sink our foundations further into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Originally, this basement was only fifty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep. Now it is a hundred. In a few years it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be more than that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But good God!" I cried; "can't you do something</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop them?"	6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shrugged his shoulders. "So far--no! How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, our chemists, our various scientists, are busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimenting night and day. It is hoped that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">may perfect a poison, a ray that will kill them off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent them from coming near the castle walls."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And if you cannot?" asked the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we cannot," replied Soltano; "then some day</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . He made a fatal gesture with his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I thought of the busy, joyful life far above, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green gardens and the laughing women and children.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought of Theda, and I suddenly realized how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much she had grown to mean to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor," I said that night when we had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired to our room, "with all those machines and tools</seg><seg type="columnLine">at your command, couldn't you make another Time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Machine ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I possibly could," replied the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Then why don't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' Perhaps I shall. Soltano has promised to put a</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory at my disposal, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Much relieved, I turned away. Here was a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for Theda and myself. I fell asleep and dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had taken her back on a time machine to 1926 and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was showing her the University campus and pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the time on the campanile clock. At breakfast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda stood behind the counter and filled my tray</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cereal, fruit, toast and eggs. That was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I had early noticed: there were no idlers</seg><seg type="columnLine">tolerated in Science Castle. All worked at something</seg><seg type="columnLine">useful. One week Servus, for instance, washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes three hours a day; the next he would be tend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the vegetable gardens; bringing in the fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads of cabbage and lettuce, gathering the firm, red</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrots, or digging potatoes. At my own request I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was given such work. I was amazed at the fertility</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those gardens, amazed that fruit trees would grow</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all under such conditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is the soil renewed very often?" I asked Servus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shook his head. "It is never renewed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you must have good fertilizers?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'We have--electricity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Electricity!" I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes. Taken from the air by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MASTER ANTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">169</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">magnetism. But you shouldn't marvel at that so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much. Didn't a German engineer do as much in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your day ? But whereas he got two crops from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sandy soil, we get seven."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So it went. I had noticed no animals of any sort</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in Science Castle, not even cows, yet there was no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lack of eggs, butter, milk or meat. Servus again ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plained the mystery. "Milk is made from turnips</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and potatoes," he explained. "I believed a man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">named Ford did that in 1926. Eggs and meat are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">manufactured synthetically." He went into technical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">details which there is no need to set down here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Truly a wonderful place, this Science Castle. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was difficult to realize that its brilliant inhabitants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were chained to a hill-top by insects which for cen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turies had been man's hopeless inferiors. But were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they so chained! Hadn't Theda rescued the Pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fessor and me by means of an aircraft? And hadn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Soltano shown us others in the process of being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">built? And hadn't we been invited to take trips m</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them? One night while I sat with her on the parapet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the moonlight, I asked Theda about it. Yes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she replied, "we have air vessels; but save for min-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing ore they do not do us much good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Why not?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Because outside of Science Castle there is hardly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a spot they dare land."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But there is Europe and Asia," I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Perhaps the ants do not control there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "On the average of once in every ten years," she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">replied, "expeditions have left here for over the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seas--and never returned. My father commanded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the last aircraft to attempt the flight. That was five</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">years ago," she added softly. I pressed her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But they seem to be wonderfully well-controlled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">machines," I said. "What drives them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Radio power. Waves are sent from a controlling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">center in the Castle here and received by a device</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">incorporated in the airships themselves. Complete</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">control of the machine is invested in the driver by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">means of a lever which oprates a very simple me-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chanical arrangement. For a radius of several hun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dred miles, and in fair weather, the aircrafts are ab-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">solutely safe and easily handled. Many of us use</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them for pleasure rides. But beyond that--" She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shook her head. "Perhaps atmospheric conditions</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">interfere with the waves when sent over too great a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">distance; perhaps the receiving apparatus fails to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">operate beyond a certain point, though theoretically</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they should pick up power waves four thousand miles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the sending station. All we know, however,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is that those who venture too far--vanish. Perhaps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they fall into the sea and are drowned. Or worse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still, on the plains, and the Master Ants. . . Her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">voice shivered to silence. For comfort against a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black spectre which took on the hideous form of an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">insect, we drew together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Theda," I said unsteadily. "O Theda! Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">you . . . will you . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In answer she kissed me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Master Ants Take to the Air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UNDER the thin metal roof which is all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuts away from us the hordes of conquering</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants, I am seated, putting the finishing touches</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this manuscript. Of the terrible catastrophe which</seg><seg type="columnLine">has occurred. I can hardly write. We were standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day by the parapet when a young Scientian who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone on a pleasure spin, planed down from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sky and landed on the plaza. His face was ashen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What is it ?" demanded Soltano sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The ants!" gasped the breathless youth. "The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ants have taken to the air!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "To the air! What do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That they have mounted the backs of insects, of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wasps a yard long, and are flying!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Instantly the Castle was in an uproar. From every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">direction the Scientians came rushing; from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">depths of the Castle, from the gardens and the pool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They assembled in* the plaza and listened to the tale</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the youth had to tell. Attracted by strange activities</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">among the mounds, he had flown nearer the ground</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than usual, when great insects had spread gossamer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wings and pursued him. Fortunately, the speed of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the airship had outdistanced them, though at first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it had been a close chase! When he finished speak-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing, Soltano mounted the rostrum and addressed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gathering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Fellow Scientians," he said, "if what we have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just heard be true, then Science Castle is in immedi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ate and grave danger. You will remember that we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have often discussed the possibility of an alliance be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tween the Master Ants and other insects. Now it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seems they have enslaved or enlisted a winged insect,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">probably of the bee family. Not only that, they have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">evidently fed them with special foods until mon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sters, capable of bearing a Master Ant aloft have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been produced.

I cried. "Surely you have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">finished it by this time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Professor nodded. "Yes," he said, "it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Then we can make our escape by means of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He looked at me pityingly.

What could be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">commonplace than this nightly respite</seg><seg type="columnLine">from worried and worrying conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, during which the nerves and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitution and muscles, exhausted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of the day are permitted to generate new</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and vigor for the work of the day to come?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet it is the very nature of this particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, that troubles Markham, and will continue to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble him for the rest of his life. He is as vision-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary as ever, but due to the sleep, or perhaps to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disillusionment which followed it, he no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">bores everyone by trying to put his visions into</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice, or by explaining how they could be so put.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very seldom now does he allow his dreams to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the surface, but when he does nobody can deny</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he cuts a truly admirable figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To begin with, Markham is somewhat of an archi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tect, considerable of an architect, if we are to judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his success. He specializes in the hollow square</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cooperative types of large apartment houses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at the same time, if some wealthy faddist or</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouveau riche desires a residence of radical design,</seg><seg type="columnLine">embodying all known mechanical conveniences, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many that are not known as yet, he comes to Mark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham. The worst of it is that his friends and fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">architects seem to imagine that it is not latent genius</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is responsible for his successes, but rather su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perior practical ability; that he got this ability by</seg><seg type="columnLine">industrious application, and all that sort of thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at school. Markham must realize how futile it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be to attempt to assail this conspiracy of thought, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his present policy of reticence is perhaps the best he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could observe under the circumstances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day in particular had been a trying one for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and had held what, he maintains, was a pecu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liar series of coincidences. First of all, he had spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole morning in preparing his entry in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">$10,000 "City Beautiful" contest that was being con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducted jointly by several newspapers, two magazines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a department store. The contest was to deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine the best plan for an ideal city on the site of</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. Nothing, of course, could be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">about removing the one that was already there, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a comparison of the actual city with the ideal one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would arouse considerable interest and bring much</seg><seg type="columnLine">publicity to all parties concerned. Furthermore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were vague rumors that the Board of Estimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Apportionment had</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a passing inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est in the matter, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the winning plan ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pealed to it, it might take</seg><seg type="columnLine">primary steps toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">moulding little old New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York into the ideal city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate, Markham</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reacted to the contest</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a cat reacts to the smell of fish. He had set his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fertile brain to work, and finally had evolved what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he considered the ideal plan. But at the same time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he later revealed, there was an undercurrent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion that told him that this was not at all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideal plan; that it was merely the best his brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do under pressure; that at any time of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day or night there might leap to his cerebellum, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he least expected it, a vision of the ideal city, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this city would be a thousandfold better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one he had produced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he pigeon-holed the plan and drawings, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing the fervent hope that the vision of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideal might occur to him before the day, two weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, when the plans would have to be submitted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had intended to spend the afternoon of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day at a library, examining certain scientific and</seg><seg type="columnLine">technical magazines, as well as catalogues, for new</seg><seg type="columnLine">household devices and labor saving machinery which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be able to incorporate into his future</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses. He found several interesting ideas, but was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon bored and strolled into a cinema house. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just his fortune to witness some fantasy that</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted to portray the city of the future. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not help smiling, as he walked out of the theater</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whenever he thought of the coincidence during</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper. In the evening, he planted himself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most comfortable armchair in his study, and, forti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied by his pipe, prepared to enjoy an hour or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reading. Not until he had opened the book did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he notice that it was a pseudo-scientific novel by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Verne, or Wells, or one of that class. And then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw his head back and indulged in a long, hearty</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His burst of mirth over, Markham felt that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the nature of his activities that day, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather not read that type of book, lest he develop</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he feared most, a "one-track" mind. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired, however, and very comfortable, and the smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his pipe was beginning to form fascinating spirals</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air. The reader may recall a time when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a similar situation. Nevertheless, he finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuaded himself that the book was no worse, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less desirable at that moment, than any other book.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So he commenced to read.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We are to assume that at some point in his reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">the print on the pages before him seemed to jumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">together into a heap, and the pipe somehow slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his lips, and his eyelids acquired the weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lead. His sense of time, his consciousness, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, became hazy. He sensed that he was falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep. But he was not aware of any subsequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankness. He seemed to regain full consciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost immediately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE was in a queer little room. It seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eight-foot cube, the hollow interior of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building block of some Brobdignagian infant. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">while it was indeed eight feet in all three dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions, it could hardly be</seg><seg type="columnLine">called a cube, for the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">melted into one another</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into the floor and ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in smooth curves that</seg><seg type="columnLine">appealed to Markham's ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chitectural nature. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not an angle in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Against one wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a neat little metal cot</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a peculiar mattress which, he found by testing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was simply an inflated rubber pad tucked inside of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immaculate white sheet. That was the sum total</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bed clothing. He was quick to surmise that as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no coverings, warmth must be supplied</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some other manner. He looked about him again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was amazed to find that there were no heating</seg><seg type="columnLine">device and no windows. With a scientific eye, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked toward the bottom of the walls, and as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected, he found, about eight inches above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level of the floor, a tiny row of holes extending all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ANY nezv thought that comes along that shows us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">-/-Z what will happen hundreds of years hence, is always</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">greeted with acclaim by the true scientifiction fan. Our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">new author presents us zvith such a situation in a novel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dress, and at the same time, you will find that there is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plenty of new scientifiction in this interesting story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">172</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">around the room. Putting his hand to one, he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stream of warm, fresh air pouring silently and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily into the room. He saw another row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes an equal distance from the ceiling, and knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">these to be for the exit of the exhausted and over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heated air that rose to the top of the room. He also</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a hemisphere of frosted glass that looked as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it had been cemented into the ceiling, from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft light streamed outward and downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He began to think about getting out, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a door. There it was, entirely of metal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without panels. Its bottom formed the only break</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the curve of the floor into the wall, but even so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherever corners occurred, they had been beautifully</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded off. He approached. There were no visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinges and no handle. Only a thin stream of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the top, bottom, and left side told that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a-door at all. He pushed against it and it yielded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tti a moment he had passed through, and it swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly back to its original position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Markham glanced rapidly about and took in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">features of the room he now found himself in. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was considerably larger than the chamber he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just left, and there was the same lack of right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angled corners. Up above were hemispherical illu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minators, but these were not lit. Great floods of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight were pouring into the room through a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass pane that formed almost the entire wall 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left. It took Markham little time to see that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass was quartz, giving free access to the all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">important ultra-violet rays. The wall opposite him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as the one through which he had come, held</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of the queer hingeless, knobless doors. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Funny that he had not noticed him before. There,</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a long, narrow flat-topped desk sat a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding him interestedly with sympathetic blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. He was leaning on the desk with both elbows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a" pen in his right hand. On his left was a file tray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his right several rows of buttons and electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulbs. But it was the clothing of the man behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desk that first made Markham doubt that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience was anything more than a casual dream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a super-modern hotel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were two visible garments. The inner was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost skintight, and apparently combined warmth</seg><seg type="columnLine">with freedom of motion. The outer was a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose cloak, that combined dignity with modesty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both were dark blue in color, with a thin yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">braid running along the edges. The man's feet were</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible beneath the desk, and at sight of them, Mark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham was compelled to display astonishment. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were encased in high-arched, open sandals, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet were not the corned, bunioned products of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization, but a shapely pair that could have served</seg><seg type="columnLine">as models for the feet of a sculptured Apollo. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">their possessor was apparently well past middle age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was silence for several minutes. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the desk, doubtlessly some sort of official, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unperturbed and seemed to have the situation well</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand, while Markham was so utterly astounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could not think of what to say or to ask first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At last the official dropped his gaze and pushed one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the buttons to his right on the desk. The bulb</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside it flashed, and he picked up from its metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">holder a black, round.object that looked like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">earphone. He put this to his ear and listened for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, then applied it to his lips. "A guide,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. That was all, and he replaced the tiny</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">phone in its holder. There was a click and the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bulb disappeared. The man resumed his writ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as if Markham no longer existed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Behind the official and to his left was a double</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Through this, a moment later, came a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some young man, clad exactly like the official, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a blue braid instead of the yellow. The older</seg><seg type="columnLine">man looked up at him and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You again, John?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, sir," was the reply. "But I don't mind. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The official resumed his writing and the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man turned to Markham. "Could you come with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Markham followed him out through the double</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and found himself in an immense corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was all of thirty feet in width. About one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet to their left, the passage ended in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">right angled turn, but on the right it extended for</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as far as the eye could see. It was well lit</seg><seg type="columnLine">by those frosted glass illuminators. The side from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they had emerged was lined with double doors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but on the opposite side, Markham was surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see the glass display-windows of shops, a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">row of them. As they walked silently along, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed many people who were clad in garments</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to those of the official and of the guide, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">an undecorated black in color. These evinced only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slight interest in the unusual clothing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger. The latter, fascinated by the novel adver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tisements and the size of the shops (each one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">three times as large as the average store he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known), noted that no two were alike as to product.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One displayed canned, boxed, and bottled food ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusively, another fresh groceries and vegetables, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">third.stationery supplies, and so on. Markham won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered if the business world had finally reached a</seg><seg type="columnLine">millenium and eliminated competition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They passed through a single door, different in</seg><seg type="columnLine">color from the others, ascended a short flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, and emerged through another door upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful terrace, formed by a set-back in the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The set-back was evenly fifty feet wide. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">innermost ten feet formed a walk. The pavement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markham noticed, was the same as that of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior, a black substance that must have been poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in a liquid state, and seemed to yield to the step.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The outer forty feet of the set-back was a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt of grass, flower beds, and small shrubbery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The guide reduced the pace to that of a stroll.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"By your clothing I judge you to be of the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentieth century," he ventured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The succession of wonders and novelties had</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten upon Markham with the remorseless pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision of a trip hammer. Now he sensed a momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary let-up, and a flood of questions occurred to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I am, as you put it," he replied to the guide, "of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the early twentieth century. But where, or when,</seg><seg type="columnLine">am I now, and how did I get here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This is New York, in the late part of the twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">first century. You are what, is known here, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">'visitor'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Undoubtedly," said Markham, with a slight at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt at sarcasm. "I could hardly call myself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">native of this place, even if I was born on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manhattan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guide laughed, good naturedly. "What I</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant," he explained, seriously, "is that you are of</seg><seg type="columnLine">_an entirely different period of time, or rather, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">A VISITOR FROM THE TWENTIETH CENTURY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">173</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">history, for we are coming to doubt more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there is such a thing as time. How you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought here--well, the advanced psychologists and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnotists of our colleges have been very successful</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their recent experiments. They think nothing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yanking out of the so-called past some person whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness is cn rapport with their united con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centrations. Of late they do it not through any</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific interest but just for the practice, as a prank</seg><seg type="columnLine">you might say; your case for instance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This thought set Markham's brain reeling. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something in the guide's tone that discouraged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from pursuing the matter. He dared not try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursue it; he felt that he would go insane if he did.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought of the situation of a psychologist who</seg><seg type="columnLine">is anxious to know the mental reactions of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling from a cliff and yet does not care to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the experiment personally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was all too bizarre. He must not question any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing; he must take everything for granted. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the guide. "What is your name," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "It will be more convenient to know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name is John Warren, 12-C-6."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Markham was aghast. "What!" he exlaimed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"has mankind come to the number and filing-case</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage so soon?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not at all," was the laughing reply. "That is</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply for purposes of mail and communication.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The 12 means that my building is in the twelfth</seg><seg type="columnLine">row from the south; the C means that it is the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">row from the west; the 6 means that out of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">families named Warren in building 12-C, mine is</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered Number 6."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You spoke," said Markham, "or 'all the families</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Warren,' and you have given a peculiar sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificance to the word 'building.' Is it that families</seg><seg type="columnLine">of similar names are confined to separate houses?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, no. There are upwards of ten thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">people to a building, you know, and there are bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be several familes of the same. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Upwards of ten thousand people! What kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of buildings have you here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warren smiled indulgently. "That will come</seg><seg type="columnLine">later," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this time they had been following the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">path. Now a low murmur seemed to be flowing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the set-back from below. They neared a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a tiny walk led to a sort of fenced platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">that overhung the edge of the flowery terrace. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">they entered, and the guide invited Markham to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look over the edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wonders and wonders! It took the man from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twentieth century several minutes to grasp all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hundred feet away was another building, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic affair a quarter of a mile in length. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a set-back on the same level as the one on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Markham and his guide, and the former quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed that the two structures were identical. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">set-backs were above the fifteenth stories, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings towered up for another ten stories.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twenty-five altogether. Not so much, Markham</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. Visionaries of his time had predicted, edi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fices of a hundred stories and more; but these</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to go in more for length, and perhaps for</seg><seg type="columnLine">width.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked downward. At the street level the</seg><seg type="columnLine">width of two hundred feet had been divided into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">central band of one hundred feet and two outside</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bands of fifty feet each. The central portion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely a great promenade, paved with the universal</seg><seg type="columnLine">black- substance that seemed to absorb the sunlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than to reflect it back into the eyes. At inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals there were gigantic kiosks, leading probably to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buildings on either side. The flanking bands</seg><seg type="columnLine">consisted of five endless moving platforms, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet in width. The speed of these platforms</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased with their distance from the promenade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the two outer ones moved at approximately</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five miles an hour. There were collapsible</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal benches on the bands, while passage from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another was facilitated by means of occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand-rails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scene was strangely familiar. The solution</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped to Markham's brain all at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why!" he cried, "such a street as this was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed by a writer of my time!"*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then he was a prophet," said Warren, calmly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is not so easy to prophesy the inevitable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," Markham continued, not having caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guide's last remark, "he mentioned, I believe, streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred yards in width and ten moving platforms</seg><seg type="columnLine">in each direction, while you have here only five.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless the coincidence is . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have such a street. It is called the Fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Way, and was once known as Fifth Avenue. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are ten platforms in each direction, and the fastest</seg><seg type="columnLine">move at a speed of nearly fifty miles an hour. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is in the exact center of the island, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer platforms are used only by people desiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to travel from one end of the island to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">very quickly. As a man's residence, place of busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and recreation centers are all in the same build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in most cases, there is very little cause for traffic</seg><seg type="columnLine">between buildings. Two platforms for each direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, in fact, would be sufficient to handle the traffic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were it not that the more platforms there are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher the speed that can be attained. Cross-town</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways move at a lower level."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fascinating as was the sight of the moving plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms and the hurrying, black-clad people, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed quite adroit at slipping from one band to</seg><seg type="columnLine">another that moved about five miles an hour faster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markham felt that he was delaying the "sight-seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">tour," for that was what he sensed their present walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be. They regained the promenade and after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short distance, the guide led the way back inside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They came to a place in the huge corridor, near a</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the building, where a peculiar track paral-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leled one wall. It was set deep into the floor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about two feet wide. Near the end of the track</seg><seg type="columnLine">were half a dozen little trucks, their square plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms level with the floor. Each platform had at</seg><seg type="columnLine">its sides two frail-looking metal railings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warren motioned Markham to the foremost plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, admonishing him to keep a tight grip on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railings. He seemed to doubt the stranger's ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do this, however, for he took from a nearby rack</seg><seg type="columnLine">a leather belt which he fastened around his waist</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to both railings. He then mounted the platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind, using no belt for himself, and indicated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markham a tiny lever on the under side of the right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand railing which he was to press.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Markham did so. The platform started slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward with a low rumble, and a similar sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">from behind apprised him that the guide was fol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *H. G. Wells, in "When the Sleeper Wakes."</seg><seg type="columnLine">174</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing. Suddenly he felt his feet shoot out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">under him, and there was a sensation as of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot from a gun. This lasted an instant and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">his position resumed the vertical and his momentum</seg><seg type="columnLine">slackened rapidly but without any unpleasant sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sations. Looking about him, he found himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of glass roofed, glass walled shed. The plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form was trundling toward the end of the track. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">released his belt and dismounted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was that?" he demanded breathlessly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warren, who had followed immediately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A high speed escalator," the guide explained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The platforms move forward and are caught by</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooks in a rapidly revolving belt. At the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incline they are released and are slowed down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">compressed air pressure. We have climbed ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories and are now on the roof."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They emerged from the shed and Markham found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was so. They were on another black-payed</seg><seg type="columnLine">promenade. Running to one side he saw, far below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrace they had just quitted, and abysmally</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther down, the street. He ran to the other side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was amazed to see, at about the same height as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	he terrace on the exterior, a park! It was square,</seg><seg type="columnLine">conforming to the shape of the building, and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing over three hundred yards square in dimension.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the center, an ornate fountain was hurling rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how-hued water high into the air and catching it</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in a marble pool. Tiny paths radiated from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fountain to the sides, and numerous children's</seg><seg type="columnLine">playgrounds nestled in the shadows of the ten-story</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. But predominating over the whole pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene was a color little associated with modern cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not at all associated with visionary cities of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future--the green of well-kept lawns and trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as they moved slowly along, stopping from</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to time to watch the playing children and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chatting housewives, Warren explained the construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the buildings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were all alike, square in shape, measuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a quarter of a mile on each side, and twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five stories in height. The upper ten stories were</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely residential, the apartments ranging in size</seg><seg type="columnLine">from single rooms to large suites. The size of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suites depended strictly on that of the family, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not on its means. The lower fifteen stories were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken up with offices, schools, and shops. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior of the square, its surface level with the six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teenth story, was a twenty feet layer of soil, sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported on a massive roof of steel and concrete. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low this roof, and down to the street level, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">such institutions as did not require the light of day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">including gymnasia, auditoria, theaters, and houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of worship. There were three more stories below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street level, one of which was entirely taken up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with generators of the electricity used in heating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighting, and operating all machinery throughout.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each building had its own electrical installation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">run on power from a gigantic plant five miles north</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Manhattan, which plant, in turn, received its cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent from Niagara Falls. The other two stories were</seg><seg type="columnLine">used for storage and by the distribution system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what is that?" asked Markham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warren smiled. The distribution system was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">so commonplace that it was hard to believe that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever was a time when it did not exist. Over across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hudson was the huge distribution Center, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">were received food products from the West and</seg><seg type="columnLine">South and clothing and manufactured goods from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the great Factory Cities at Niagara Falls and along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mississippi. From this center an intricate sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem of pneumatic tubes spread under the Hudson</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into Manhattan, an individual tube for each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scores of buildings. Through these the food</seg><seg type="columnLine">products and clothing and manufactured goods were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot in great containers to the cellar stations, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were relayed through a smaller system</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the shops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The noise from the moving ways far below had</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminished considerably. The number of people on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the promenades, both on the roofs and on the set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs, had increased as more and more people, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's work done, were trying to get in a last walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the rays of the setting sun. The two men came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a corner of the building, where Markham saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the path on which they moved, was connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the corresponding paths on the two adjacent</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings by slender bridges of cantilever construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. They proceeded across one of them, the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the twentieth century conquering by sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental effort the dizziness that threatened him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have it!" he exclaimed suddenly. "Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed queer, something bothered me when I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the streets, and I have just realized what it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	have not seen any automobiles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Warren was puzzled for a moment. "Automo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">biles," he murmured, "automobiles. ... oh! You</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean gasoline surface vehicles!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Markham. "Where are they?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are none."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What! You mean to tell me that there are no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more automobiles? Why, in my time New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being carved to suit them. Streets were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">widened, sidewalks were being narrowed, residences</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being torn down ruthlessly to make streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cross streets for them. Skyscraping garages</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the business districts were being contemplated</seg><seg type="columnLine">and built. Nearly every family had an auto, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacturers were trying to convince them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they needed two. And now, less than two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">years later, you say that there are no more automo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">biles. Impossible!" He almost felt hurt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As might have been foreseen," said Warren,</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly, "the whole industry that was growing so</seg><seg type="columnLine">abnormally, fell in one crash. Around 1975, a grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shortage of petroleum, that the manufacturers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were trying desperately to keep under cover, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer be concealed. There were terrible riots</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mob scenes in New York, Chicago, Detroit, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact all over the globe. In a thousand cities, use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less automobiles were piled up in the streets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">burnt. The plants of the two greatest manufac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turers were mobbed and razed to the ground. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a month the United States suffered a complete chaos.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then things gradually adjusted themselves. New</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil fields were subsequently discovered, and an effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient substitute for gasoline was produced synthetic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally by an experimental chemist, but the gasoline</seg><seg type="columnLine">car never regained the pinnacle it had held before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chaos."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?" asked Markham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have said," began Warren, apparently ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">relevantly, "that the plans of whole cities were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to suit the convenience of the automobiles;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that houses were being torn down, playgrounds bi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sected by roads, parks destroyed by the fumes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gasoline and pedestrians crowded to the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">or killed by the score; was it not so?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">A VISITOR FROM THE TWENTIETH CENTURY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">175</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," Markham conceded, but . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The duration of houses was halved by the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant vibration of passing trucks; the manufacturers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in feverish competition, were making the cars cheaper</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cheaper, and more and more defective; forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">percent of the men at the wheels were unfit to drive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet did so, thanks to incompetent laws; the roads</seg><seg type="columnLine">were choked with gaudy hire-cars, called, I believe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxicabs, driven by men who, lured by the profits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had obtained licenses after a minimum number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessons and no experience whatever; men who after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day's work were mere automatons and incapable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being entrusted with the human lives they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for; was it not so?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes," agreed Markham. The facts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">all undeniable, yet it was the least bit irritating to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have them served up to him in this gatling-gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion. His irritation, unknown to him, was based</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a human and excusable pride in his own times</seg><seg type="columnLine">as contrasted with these.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," continued Warren, "the eyes of the people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heretofore blinded to these abortive conditions, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened to them by the chaos. The automobile no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer had the same significance; 110 longer seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">so necessary, or rather, so desirable in view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions that accompanied it. The manufacture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cars declined, ceased to be profitable, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time stopped altogether. Today we have a form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface vehicle, used solely for pleasure, one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would hardly recognize.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our 'roads' consist of parallel metal tracks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet apart, each a foot in width. The vehicles</seg><seg type="columnLine">are forty feet in length, fifteen in width, and gyro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scopic, balancing on two huge rubber-tired wheels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are known colloquially as 'capsules,' for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body consists of a capsule-shaped unbreakable quartz</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. It is blown into the standard shape, and holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">are pierced for entrance and ventilation. The cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">are comfortably furnished and self-operating, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they draw power by roller contacts and trolleys you</seg><seg type="columnLine">might call them, from the metal track to which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are held by a sort of electro-magnetism. Automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety devices stop the car as soon as it comes within</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty feet of another. Anyone desiring to use one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the capsules goes across the Hudson to the depot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hires one. It bowls along over hill and dale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintaining an even speed of fifty miles an hour."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fifty miles an hour!" exclaimed Markham. "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that considered a proper speed for a pleasure ride?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Certainly," said Warren. "It is just the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, once all responsibility and care of operation</seg><seg type="columnLine">are removed. Besides, you forget that the world ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vances. One hundred years before your time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty miles an hour was considered tempting fric-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True," Markham acknowledged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So absorbed had he been in the conversation that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had kept his eyes on the pavement before him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for most of the time. They had been strolling north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. Now his eyes, raised for the first time, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered a vast structure a mile away, that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fill the entire quarter from horizon to zenith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The New York Tower." explained Warren. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only real skyscraper it has been deemed necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have. It is not hollow, but a solid structure, having,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you see, pyramidal setbacks. It is not as wide as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other buildings, but together with the great plaza</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gardens that surround it, occupies the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">space that four of them would occupy. It is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred stories in height, and contains all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">executive, legislative, and judicial offices of the mu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nicipal and state governments, and also the local</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches of the various federal departments. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">may seem strange to you, but the duties of govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment have been considerably changed and reduced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The number of municipal ordinances, for instance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is only about one-third what it was in your time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cellar of the Tower contains the Post Office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which letters and packages are distributed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">pneumatic tubes and tunnels to the branch Post Of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fices in each building."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He referred to his wrist-watch, a queer one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed device. "Ah, yes. In a moment you will see</seg><seg type="columnLine">something interesting. Watch the top of the Tower."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Markham watched. Soon he saw a gigantic af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair, resembling a net, rise slowly into the air, lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by four balloons. Taking shape, it resolved into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great square funnel of netted fabric, the open mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which was fully five hundred feet above the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tower, to which it was connected by a slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">net-work chute. The balloons were at the corners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," said the guide, "look to the west."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that direction a large stream-lined mono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane was splitting the air in straight, unhalted flight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jt flew faster than Markham had ever seen an air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane go before. As it passed above the funnel, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">released a large sack, which dropped down through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chute into the building proper. The monoplane</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept on toward the east, seeming to descend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Western Mail," said Warren. "At present</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flight from San Francisco takes ten hours, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will be remedied within fifteen years, by which</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the Transcontinental Pneumatic will be com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    . . the flight from San Francisco takes ten hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that will be remedied . . The phrase rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Markham's brain, moving him to alternate</seg><seg type="columnLine">spells of laughter and wonderment. These people</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have the most awful conception of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and speed. He now feared to comment or to express</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration for what Warren regarded as the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monplace, lest he should reveal his "provincialism."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look again," cried Warren, "this time to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">east."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far off in the heavens a tiny silver shape, resemb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling a minnow in a limpid pool, was darting toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, descending as it came. In a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markham saw that it was a dirigible, much the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">as those of his time, but somewhat larger. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin was a long structure that fitted snugly against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gas bag, like a great keel. The advantages of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this arrangement over that of the half-dozen sepa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated cabins and engines he was used to, as to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased wind-resistance and increased ease of opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, were obvious to Markham. He surmised from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size of the cabin that a new lifting compound was</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed, and found by asking Warren that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it approached, heading apparently for the New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York Tower, his attention was attracted to a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction at the northwest corner of the roof of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">building. It was a vertical shaft of metal bars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching one hundred feet into the air. At its top</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a jumble of wheels, gears, and cables. The air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship dropped a weighted cable which hooked into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of this structure, and as it floated past, the cable</seg><seg type="columnLine">became taut and the ship was slowly drawn down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open metal shaft. And then Markham could</seg><seg type="columnLine">176</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly suppress a thrill of pride, such as overcame</seg><seg type="columnLine">him when he had seen his first house completed; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the shaft fitted neatly into the floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airship cabin, and he could see a tiny car run swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the shaft and into the cabin itself. It was all an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea which he had conceived and discussed often with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellow club members, the device of a mooring</seg><seg type="columnLine">mast, which would extend into a hole in an airship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that an elevator in the shaft would rise level with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin floor. But they had laughed at him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">here it was, a wonderful reality. A moment later he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the car descend, laden with people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me," he turned to Warren. "I am eager to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the progress the world has made, especially in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sociology and transportation. There was a deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">theorizing in my time, but from what I have seen I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine that most of it either exaggerated or under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estimated the truth. That dirigible, for instance. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine it is a transatlantic conveyance--" Warren</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded "--is all oceanic transportation like that ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, indeed," said the guide. "The airships carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">only mail, visiting and returning diplomats, and such</seg><seg type="columnLine">people as can convince the authorities that their voy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age requires all possible haste and are willing to pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">the price. The passage from New York to Paris</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes something over fifteen hours. Ordinary trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oceanic traffic has changed radically. You may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that there is nothing in sight resembling a</seg><seg type="columnLine">port, or loading place for ships."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have remarked something like that," admitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markham, "but I had thought it was due to the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cendency of airships."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was some little agitation for developing</seg><seg type="columnLine">air navigation in your time," Warren went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"which lasted until well after the Chaos of 1975.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But these plans were ultimately shelved for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons, one of which was the unexpected develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of means of surface transportation. Trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atlantic voyagers now travel in gigantic covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">sledges which have practically no draft at all, and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven both by water screws and by air propellers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These ply between the great seaport at the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip of Long Island and a recently developed port on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coast of France, taking no more than thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours for the trip. From the seaport, passengers are</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken in ten minutes by pneumatic tubes to the Grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Depot, half a mile beneath the New York Tower.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freight boats are modeled more after the so-called</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean greyhounds of your time, but never take more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than sixty hours to go to Europe. They also dock at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Eastern Seaport, but the freight is shot by tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Distribution Center.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Inter-urban communication is carried on through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great pneumatic tubes. As I have told you, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Transcontinental Pneumatic is now under construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and will afford transportation between the coasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">in from two to three hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But surely the pneumatic tube isn't universal,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested Markham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly not," said Warren, "although in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">it probably will be. In outlying sections we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the advanced equivalent of the railroad of your time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is single railed, like the pleasure vehicles I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">described to you, and also like those vehicles, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trains draw their power from the same compound</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail they ride on. These rails are so constructed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bridges, viaducts, and tunnels, that there is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minimum of curves and the altitude does not vary a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet in as many miles. The result is a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth speed of one hundred and fifty miles an hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Monorails, as they are called, are used through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out Australia, Africa, Asia, and South America, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer in Europe, and only in the less settled por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of North America."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had turned back toward the south. The sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hovering above the western horizon, a depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing watchman taking his last look at a satisfied and</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfactory world. There was a growing chill in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me of the people," said Markham. "How</seg><seg type="columnLine">they live; are they happy? Surely with your ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced machinery, unemployment must present a</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah," said Warren, "the solution of that problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a matter on which we pride ourselves. Let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain. We assume that two men, working eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours with hand tools, can complete a piece of work</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that time. A machine is invented to do the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of both men in the same time, so that only one is now</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed to handle the machine. In your time, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those men would have handled the machine, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other would have starved. Today, the men would</seg><seg type="columnLine">each work four hours at handling the machine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both would be happy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see," said Markham. "As the efficiency of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery increases you divide the time of labor</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the number of workers displaced by the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine. It is wonderful, almost ideal, but it never</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have worked in my age. The spare time would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have hung heavy on our hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," explained Warren, "is a matter of evolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. We spend this 'spare time' in reading, in harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less and beneficial amusement, and the pursuit of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arts and sciences. The world has advanced tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendously in that respect."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Community life has also undergone radical</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes. There are today in the United States only</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen cities, similar in appearance to this, except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">differences based on climate, population, and regional</seg><seg type="columnLine">architecture. Each city has its standardized build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and its municipal tower, some follow the pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">checkerboard design, like New York, and some are</seg><seg type="columnLine">radial, like Washington. Five cities, New York,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago, San Francisco, St. Louis, and New Orleans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a population of over ten million. The others</seg><seg type="columnLine">all have over five. There are an additional ten mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion living in the half-dozen nameless Factory Cities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twenty-five million more scattered throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land. These last are the food makers, the back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone of the country. All the land outside the cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">is either national parkland or else under cultivation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for a few suburbs of a strictly residential</seg><seg type="columnLine">character in the neighborhood of the larger cities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The twenty-five million are served by the Monorails</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by private airplanes; they are forbidden by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">government to organize into communities or mutual</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit associations, so that they regard themselves as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whole and are doubtlessly happier that way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow they had stopped to lean on the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row railing of a path that bridged the abyss between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two buildings and watch Long Island bathed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last rays of the sun. Where once had thrived the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing borough of Brooklyn was now a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">parkland of close-cropped lawn, reddening trees, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered residences and bungalows that stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to the east as far as Markham could see. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warren had said was true; there was not a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">building of urban character outside of the island of</seg><seg type="columnLine">A VISITOR FROM THE TWENTIETH CENTURA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">177</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Manhattan, although much land had been added to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island itself. There were not even bridges.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey, the land to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north, all were a little paradise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is wonderful," said Markham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun out of sight, they turned southward once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. "We must get back to 12-C," said Warren.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I shall present you to the Captain of the Welfare</seg><seg type="columnLine">Office where you first found yourself." They walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length of a building and out upon another pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carious bridge. Snowflakes began to drift down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them in increasing numbers. The black pave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment absorbed the moist flakes, but in the process</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was formed a thin watery surface which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes of the man from the twentieth century were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not qualified to cope with. A group of people ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached them, head down to avoid the north wind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Markham lurched to one side to prevent their</seg><seg type="columnLine">running into him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His lurch carried him clean through the railing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He heard a cry of dismay from Warren, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was hurtling headfirst down the twenty-five story</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth. He saw the moving, white-coated ways rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up to meet him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	* *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He awoke, with a feeling of stiffness, on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the arm chair in which he last remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. His pet poodle was licking his face, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady gust of wind was blowing through the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Formerly a student of dream phenomena,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markham recognized the circumstances which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent such fearsome realism to that last part of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream. The wind from behind him, as that north</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind had been, the white poodle, who, running back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and forth as he had tumbled from the chair, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given the fleeting impression of white moving ways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the tumble itself. Yes, it had all been a dream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however strange and wonderful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reader may be interested in subsequent events.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inspired by his vision, Markham ran to his desk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdrew his plan from its pigeonhole, and tore it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits. He then sat down and worked far into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night on this other plan, which had come to him much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had expected it to come. He modified it con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderably, but the principles remained the same. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested the uniformity of buildings, all twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five stories in height and a quarter of a mile square,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a set-back at the fifteenth story and a park on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interior. He suggested the two hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets, but lest he seem too radical, he described</seg><seg type="columnLine">them for automobile traffic. Finally, he suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great New York Tower, with its government of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fices, giant Post Offices, and dirigible mooring mast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plan that won the contest was a fanciful thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">embodying towering skyscrapers in artistic shapes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no two of which were alike, and the uses of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not quite dear. What was probably the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning factor was the advanced suggestion of an air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane hangar and landing platform on every roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Markham's entry was returned courteously, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">criticism that it was a "highly improbable and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical combination of the too fanciful and the too</seg><seg type="columnLine">conservative."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Markham, to all extents, has abandoned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions, but as creative architect he has become the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most outstanding worker in that gradual scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">and civic evolution which never can be covered at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one jump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE END</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In this department we shall discuss, every month, topics of interest to readers.

In other</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, while we like the stories, we would love</seg><seg type="columnLine">them if he would not make us so tired of tedious</seg><seg type="columnLine">details that we almost lose interest before he gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I have enjoyed many of the stories, but I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that The Moon Pool was the best I have ever read</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your magazine.

The millions of insects, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their winged steeds, simply fell upon the giant ray</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cone and smothered it to ineffectiveness with their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">charred bodies. Nearly two hundred of the Scien-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tians fell in battle, stung to death by the sword-like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stings of the flying insects. The remainder fled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">panic-stricken from the roof into the interior of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Castle and sealed up the entrance with impregnable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">composite metal.

All that is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vulnerable is a decaying wreck. As I look at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scene of unutterable desolation, despair grips my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heart, and a wild desire to strap myself in the Time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Machine and quit this terrible future for the past,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">almost overwhelms me. But that is impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">There is nothing to do but stay and face whatever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the future holds in store for us-. Soltano maintains</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that our situation is not yet hopeless. Those Scien-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tians amaze me. Their courage and optimism in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">-face of disaster are wonderful. Now I know what</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their religion is: It is an abiding faith in the power</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of their science to aid and uphold them. The Pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fessor tells me of an intricate arrangement for sup-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plying us with air; I do not understand it yet very-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">well, "but it is made clear to me that we can live in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the interior of the Castle indefinitely.

Meantime, in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">splendidly equipped laboratories and machine shops,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the scientists and inventors are rushing forward ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">periments which may release, they say, the energy in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the atom and give us possession of weapons which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will destroy the ants and return the lordship of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">America to man. But as to this, I do not know; I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hardly dare hope.

Nevertheless, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am going to tie this manuscript in the Time Machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which stands ready at my side, and send it back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the period I have left forever. I repeat my hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it will fall into the hands of intelligent people</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that its contents will be made known to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public. It may be that we shall overcome the ants</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the inevitable final conflict between men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects.

I am writing this letter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">praise your super-classic, Amazing Stories, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I am a charter reader. Secondly, I write</seg><seg type="columnLine">this to take up my bludgeon on Mr. Wells' side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the argument. Anent The War of the Worlds</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. Surely such splendidly-written material</seg><seg type="columnLine">must appeal to anyone who truly knows and ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ereciates artful description. Wells merely uses his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ne description to bring out the high lights in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories, the same way in which Mr. Merritt en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hances the beauty of his Moon Pool with sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">description. Nobody objected to Mr. Merritt's de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scriptive matter, because it moved along somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">"snappier" than Mr. Wells' description. Wells is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a remarkable author, and I am sure his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">popularity has not come about accidentally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for picking apart certain stories, and squab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling over trifling mechanical details, that's illib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral. There must be some "Esnesnon" now-and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, a little fairy tale here and there, to keep our</seg><seg type="columnLine">appetite for romance whetted. We must overlook</seg><seg type="columnLine">the overdrawn and ridiculous situations, for there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are so many delightful things that grow out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional absurdities. I want to confess here that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I swallowed Dr. Mentiroso, hook, sinker, et al, till</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the boys declared him a phenomenal liar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I fail to get any edification or "kick" out of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories as The Underseas Express, The Star of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dead Love, The Machine Man of Ardathia, The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tide Projectile Transportation Co., and the detec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive tales. The latter are obvious and flat, carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a ' canned" flavor for me. Your illustrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">are splendid as is. Mr. Paul catches the right in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiration, and, as an artist myself, I appreciate his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleverness. Your idea of the Quarterly is O. K.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a nice compromise over the semi-monthly idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To date, the stories that have appealed to me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most are: Off On a Comet, The Moon Metal, The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Land That Time Forgot. Station X, Dr. Moreau's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island, The Malignant Entity, The Second Deluge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Moon Pool, War of the Worlds, Around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Universe, and kindred tales. I read all and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue of Amazing Stories That's only the half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. I have read such as Dr. Moreau's Island and</seg><seg type="columnLine">others two or three times. I consider myself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">discriminating reader, so this must mean a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribute to some of your authors' work. At any</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate, Mr. Editor, I cannot give you any construc- *</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive advice further as to the conduct of your edi- \</seg><seg type="columnLine">torial work. I'm satisfied with your efforts as is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I trust Amazing Stories will prosper as</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly as has your Radio News and other splen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">did publications. By the way, I read all of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">excepting your Spanish one. I trust you have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patience to finish this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                           Geo. C.

The critic's re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark is not reproachful, rather in behalf of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine, yet it contains a certain word that has</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jed me to write this letter. 1 quote the remark:</seg><seg type="columnLine">Impossible themes are very interesting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now my idea is, impossible themes arc not inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting. Perhaps you will think that I dislike the</seg><seg type="columnLine">majority of your stories on this account, but on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contrary I do not. And why? For the simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason that with the exception of one, none of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">themes are absolutely impossible. The one excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is the so-called "Time Traveler" or any con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traption that makes it possible for our physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves to mingle with the peoples of the past or</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. 1 need not go into detail why I believe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossibility of this theory or rather nightmare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since your critics have given as excellent reasons</seg><seg type="columnLine">as can possibly be made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for your other stories, although some are</seg><seg type="columnLine">more feasible than others, as I said before, none</seg><seg type="columnLine">are impossible. The most fascinating stories are</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of unknown lands, planes and planets, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their inhabitants, on whom the author can specu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late as to the shape of body and features. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tail of these tales are such as The Revolt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pedestrians, in which we live in the future, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an age that is recuperating from some calamity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stories of inventions usually bring up the rear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although quite often one is found that is very</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My reaction to such a story as Jules Verne's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Master of the World gives me an idea how people</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few hundred years from now will look upon some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our scientific feats of today. I smile when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice the enthusiasm of Jules Verne when he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribes the speed of the "Terror." Today we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes capable of over 250 miles per hour and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can build automobiles of the same speed. Vet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when someone says that within a hundred years</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may be traveling as fast as the rotation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, we have a skeptic on every hand. Gradually,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, since the advent of the radio and vita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone, the birth of television and the new develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments in aviation, the ignoramuses arc waking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that skeptics are a hindrance to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancement of civilization, and that many things</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered impossible are only so because of lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of investigation and development.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before closing, I want to commend you for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first three "Miinchhausen" stories in the February</seg><seg type="columnLine">issue.

With one exception it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the only periodical which 1 ever really looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">for in advance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In your latest edition you published a story, Ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">Million Miles Sunward, and asked your readers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a certain flaw in its science. Now, to shift</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amount of matter stated in the story would</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly change the axis of the earth. But would</seg><seg type="columnLine">it throw it out of its orbit? No! Because at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">present position, the centrifugal force generated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">its annual journey around the sun exactly counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acts the gravitation toward that body. To either</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase or decrease the speed of the earth would</seg><seg type="columnLine">change its orbit, but the mere shifting of matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not, because the two forces before mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">would remain the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, Mr. Simeon, of Iowa, in the Discussions</seg><seg type="columnLine">Department mentioned the fact that as the trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eler in space exceeded the speed of light, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see the stars behind him apparently diminishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in size. And the editor stated that as the rays had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been emitted long ago, the traveler would still be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their midst, and could still see them. So far, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">good. llut as he would be overtaking the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves, he would either see the same stars in front,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or if moving either too fast or too slow, the waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">would lie either too short or too long to be visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the human eye.
