            <seg type="columnLine">alone, one hundred dollars is very limited</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">capital for a motor trip. He had dwelt at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">length upon several minor weak spots in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Henry's rather elderly car, which might</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">give way and call for attention, which in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turn meant cash outlay; he had mentioned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the high cost of living and its bearing on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hotel rates; he had mentioned, as well,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about everything else that had occurred to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him and that might possibly have some de-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">terring effect upon Henry--and the best</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had received in return was the calm</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">smile of Henry's unaltered determination.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So that now Henry bowled along with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">itself out automatically and the future held</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nothing but good for Henry Baird. That</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">persistent run of hard luck had been left</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">behind; he seemed to know it--that was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all. The man Blackton and his ridiculous</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">claim would be thrown from the Michigan</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">courts; the mine would be sold to Tilbury</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and Tilbury for the full eight hundred thou-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Aye, with a little care Henry might look</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">would run over to the Darrow place and--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">oh, just pop in unexpectedly, after he had</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Full of miles and hard service, its end</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">stretched out sickeningly from the flattened</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">with heart pounding rather more energeti-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">better not to dwell too minutely upon his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">words; in a broad way, they indicated his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">even at this distance. Henry smiled grimly</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was the poorer by an even fifty dol-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">himself frowning over the queer, unac-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">countable skip in his motor. Poor gas was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">probably the cause; he tried a new car-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And the skip persisted and grew worse.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">With another fifteen miles of increasingly</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">took out his spark-plugs one by one and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">scrubbed their points carefully. They did</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The first cold dread, as to the real cause,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">its " New Bingham--fourteen miles " sign</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and its little cluster of houses ahead. He</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Yes, you will, Mr. Baird! It's a lovely</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was a mere five-dollar bill, shrink-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" I'd like to, but I can't even afford to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">do that," sighed Henry Baird. " What</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">just occurred to me was this: we might</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It is possible that the faintest shade of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">And then, with a significant inclination</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">two freezers and their dishes and business</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was decidedly slow back here, Henry dug</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out his latest capital and smoothed out the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bills more carefully.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A few tens there were and more fives,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with two-dollar bills beyond number. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">assorted them, chuckling, and rolled them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into smaller compass; and for a little while</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he stared at the white enameled top of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">table and pondered.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There would be an early evening train</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for Rockridge. He would catch that, be-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cause all trains stopped here at New Bing-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ham, and have himself at the inn in time</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for a rather late dinner, probably enough.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then, since he had not been through the</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">little mountain summer colony for several</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">years and remembered little of its geogra-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">phy, he would make inquiry as to the loca-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion of the Darrow place; and after that,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if it was within strolling distance, he would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stroll over.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He would collide with Alan Moss, of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">course. He grinned unpleasantly at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">table. With three hundred dollars in his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pocket, he fancied, he would give Alan to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">understand that, he had arrived for the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">better part of the summer--and Mabel was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not markedly enthusiastic about motoring,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">even in pale-blue sport cars, but she did</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">want to learn a real game of golf--and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Alan, trying to cover nine holes under three</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or four hundred, was a sight to bring tears</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the angels, whereas Henry was rather</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">good in a small way.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">For a while this afternoon, Henry had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been on the verge of real depression, but he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was able to face the future fearlessly enough !</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now. In fact, Henry looked the future</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">right in the eye and grinned securely. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was not banking on it at all, of course, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some little inner voice informed Henry that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his luck had turned and that from this point</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">onward things would go rather smoothly.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Yesterday, what with Anderson and Larkin</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and getting down to his last hundred and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all the rest, he had been rather groggy and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">confused; now all things ahead wore a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brighter aspect. He was sure of a breathing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spell and in it, now that he had banished</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that absurd " hard luck " thought, matters</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would straighten out naturally and happily.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So Henry sighed pleasantly and gazed at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the roof of the warm little tent for another</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spell and then strolled out into the crowd</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">again and looked around.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">More than a little did he wish that Singer</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had said nothing about waiting to instruct</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the winner of his old faithful car. It would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have pleased Henry better just then to find</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a hacking-car and load his little trunk</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">aboard and then get down to the railroad--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or, if he was willing to do it at any reason-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">able figure, to let the hacking-car take him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">straight over to Rockridge.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Yes, that was the idea, anyway, no mat-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ter what they charged! That would take</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him into Rockridge before any evening train</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and, in a car, he could make inquiries and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and as he wondered, the very girl who had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">with a breathless:</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Who won it?" smiled Henry. " You?"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Your car? Oh, I don't know. I think</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they're just drawing now. It wasn't that I</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" From the train? Looking for me?"</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">perhaps a dozen paces from end to end,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and some five paces wide. Behind a parti-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">enough for a man to press through, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the chisel marks at his sides it had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">evidently been artificially widened from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time to time. At the end of the narrow</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">If Lefty had proceeded "cautiously up to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">no idea what was happening. Perhaps the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">was now crouched against the wall in an-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other part of the place, ready to open fire</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at the first stir of the blanket. Perhaps</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had .stolen out of the cave by another</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The thought sent a chill down Lefty's back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and he turned his head quickly. Then he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">edge of the blanket he paused for a long</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and deathly minute, -but Lefty was not a</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He «swung the blanket aside and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crouched in the entrance with his gun lev-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">like the light that comes into an animal's</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Vaughn was growing a bit restive when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he noticed the black velvet curtains part</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gradually and Arsenjo thrust his splendid</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">he had reentered by the door behind the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This was the signal for Vaughn to do two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">things. He noiselessly closed the glass</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doors--as a practical means of resisting the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spell--and then lifted the field-glasses to his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eyes. Of course Arsenjo was in full view</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as it was, and not more than fifty feet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away; but Vaughn was particularly desirous</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">hands. One hung at his side, the other was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thrust with apparent carelessness between</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his coat and waistcoat. That was the hand</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that Vaughn watched--tirelessly. But it</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The strains of the music had, of course,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">engrossed though he was in watching the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">thrilled by a sudden deep, vibrant note of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But her father-- Vaughn had scarcely</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">asked himself the question when Arsenjo</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">buried his nose in his handkerchief. This</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">simple proceeding surely was not sufficient</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to make him immune to the effects of the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This surmise was correct. Arsenjo used</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In a moment Arsenjo returned. This</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Now was the moment to begin watching</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ignorance of what was going on in the other</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">room. Of the dozen electric lights that had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been turned on, perhaps one of very low</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">candle-power was still burning. This one,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hidden behind the frieze, gave only the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">figure appeared. In the dimness the face</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">short distance from the floor Vaughn judged</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the newcomer to be the undersized mestizo</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Keeping his eyes on the three Henners, he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to see Miguel safely out of the house. When</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">advancing, opened the door leading to the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">one of the glass doors an inch or two and</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The knuckles on Borden's hand whitened</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as he held the rail. " You didn't know</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But Kipp looked after him anxiously as</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" And you stay--how long?" Nielsene's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">voice was friendly, but only that. There</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was no Circe's song in its cool depths; only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the pleasure of one who meets an old and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">her workaday costume, but the stranger ap-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">peared to find nothing grotesque in it. In-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The man seemed to become a little more</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was silvered over. In a tree near Matteson</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an owl uttered its tremulous evening cry,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and far back of the house a whippoorwill</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Some time, before long, said Matteson to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He stood up, and she came into his arms</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He sat there under the tree for a long</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was no throb of jealousy in his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He turned his back while they made their</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But he had no feeling that she would do so.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Her absence created a void. He had a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He returned to the chair, and sank into</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">There was no fact to take hold of, and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had been on guard and Alice had somehow</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">hours a perfectly strong, healthy, normal</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">girl had changed into a fainting and then a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">That was the way he phrased it. Alice's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">going was not a disappearance; it was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vanishing. Such things didn't happen in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his matter-of-fact legal world, where there</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He rose and went out to the garage. It</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He stood for a few moments in the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in her absence from him, and he pictured</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her now. He moved her before his mind's</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">through the door of the library. She came</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to him on the porch. Always there was an</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of us except Miss Graves had hatchets or</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was bigger than any statue I had ever</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it was forty-five feet high. I judged he was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">tell anything by the length of a shadowy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but the statue was a big one. It was a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">cept the head, away up among the trees,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the head must have been ten or twelve</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was something majestic and grand</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and solemn about that big stone figure,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sitting there with its head up in the tree-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tops; and its face had the most peaceful</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Just think," I said to Miss Graves,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" he's been sitting there a thousand years</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or so, and has hardly seen a human being</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Here it was not such hard going as the rest</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had been, and we figured that there must</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">there was nothing but plain stone paving</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In half an hour we reached another</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">statue. This one was lying on its back in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the jungle, and Marshall climbed up to its</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">base, only to find that there was no swastika</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on this one either.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So we went half-way between the two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">statues and headed east. We knew about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">how far we had to go, and sure enough in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">another half-hour or less we sighted the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">third statue ahead, up among the trees like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the first had been. Kelpy was in the lead</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when we got up to it, and he slid in through</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the trees around the base, and let out a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wild yell.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Here it is, lads!" he yipped, and we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">came around to where he was. We could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">see right away that this statue was different</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the others, because the base was all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">carved up something scrumptious, and right</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the center, about as high as my head, was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a big swastika, which was very conspicuous.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At that, we all rushed around to the back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and began hacking away the jungle there.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I guess all of us were pretty well excited,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but Traddle was not so excited that he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">overlooked a good bet; because I was work-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing at one corner of the statue all by myself,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when suddenly something streaked out from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the trees and missed me by two inches and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was gone again in the jungle. It was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">knife, and it had meant business.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I jerked out my automatic and fired it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into the trees where the knife had come</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from. There was a wild yell and a minute</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">later Traddle appeared in a hurry. Every-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">body wanted to know what was up; so did</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" What's the matter with you?" he</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" It got jerked out of my hand," he said.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">him look at Marshall, and knew that they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were getting old Traddle sized up pretty</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">well by this time. Buck tipped me a wink,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and seemed mighty relieved. There was no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">more said, and we all got to work again.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Professor Graves and Miss Graves came</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">along, having heard the shooting, just as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we got the back side of the statue cleared</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away. Then, I can tell you, there was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some excitement! Right in front of us, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about eight feet up, we could see a big</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stone set into the base of the statue--set</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pretty loose, too.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"That's it!" yelped Traddle. "Here,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Kelpy, let me get on your shoulders--"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Not me," said Kelpy, grinning.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" You're the one to stand under--you and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Marshall. Here, Perkins! You're the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that stone."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"With us standing underneath?" said</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">However, I got up and tried the stone,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and found that it would move a little. Pro-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fessor Graves chipped in and said to wedge</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it over to one side, which I did with a couple</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of hatchets. A minute later we could move</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out the stone and there was a hole three</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">feet square in the statue, and everybody</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was trying to reach it before the others.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Kelpy got there first, so then we stood back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and took turns getting up and crawling into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the hole. Traddle pretty near got stuck</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">going through, but he got inside finally.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was a pretty sad business, taking it all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">around. Inside the statue's base was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">room about eight feet square. Kelpy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lighted it all up with an electric torch, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was as empty as Jonah was when he got</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out of the whale. There was not a solitary</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing in it! Not even a smell of a jewel.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The ceiling was less than six feet high, so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we had to stoop.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">We did not stay very long, any of us.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">We had found the right place, and that was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all the good it did us. Professor Graves</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and Leora were as disappointed as anybody</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when they heard about it, and Kelpy stayed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and to be protecting her against snakes and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">from us, where a boat had just put him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ashore, was a little man who looked like a</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They felt a little better after coming</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">think a native is a native and should stay</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so, and he was barely polite to the Sultan,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">being stiff and haughty. Then the Sultan</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sent a boat to get Fong T'sai, which I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought was mighty handsome of him; but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it made Marshall mad again, because he</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">However, Miss Graves gave Marshall a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">out, and Fong T'sai came abroad, and we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had a very pleasant afternoon. Then the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sultan said we made up a very cosmopolitan</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crowd and he enjoyed it, and he asked us</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all to stay aboard and go up to his royal</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">preserve with him and make him a visit.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He said there would be some shooting and</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Well, Kelpy said he was a bit tired of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">archeologizing, and the others agreed that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they needed a rest. I said I must get a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clean shirt or two, which made the Sultan</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">laugh, and Miss Graves wanted some more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clothes, so we decided we would get our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">things and go along with the Sultan. Fong</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">T'sai did not say anything, until the Sultan</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pressed him, then he bowed and said he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would be charmed. So we got into a boat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and went back to the Maria Buck.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">1 was feeling pretty good over being a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that way, but I noticed that Fong T'sai and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Buck kept quiet and looked anxious. Back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the schooner, I slung some things into a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suit-case, and then I went into the stern</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cabin to find Buck. He was there and so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was Fong T'sai, and so were the two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Chinese mates of the schooner. Fong was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Not wanting to disturb him, I went over</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and then suddenly I saw something down</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in one corner. It was a lot of squares, and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Then 1 remembered that Findlay had had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">On the way up the river Sultan Lumpur</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">talked just like he was an ordinary person,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that he had his own notions of enjoying</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">life; he was quite frank about it, and did</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not put on any civilized airs either. We</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all liked him fine, and if Fong T'sai or Buck</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">We got up to the Malay village and the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had sent a boat on up the river that morn-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing, so at the wharf we found a whole re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ception committee. There were bullock</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">carts fitted up pretty grand, and Malay</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">soldiers with rifles and swords and gay silk</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">robes, and a fat, little man who was the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sultan's steward. * His name was Tock</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Gump. Then there were drummers and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flute players and a crowd of ladies who did</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not believe in hiding their light under a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bushel, as Buck said; they danced and the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">happy because the Sultan had come home.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So the band started to work, and we got</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">dancing on ahead and singing, and the band</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tootling, and the jungle all around us. But</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all of a sudden the jungle opened up, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we came into the open at the top of a hill</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I have said, the Sultan had built it out of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">lived. The palace itself was the main thing.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The whole front was gilded, and some of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the roof, and we could see the shimmer of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">glass windows and a hothouse, which made</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it real up to date. The building was of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">particularly. That was only proper, she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">being the only female in our party. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gave her two pretty Malay girls to wait on</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">So he started in, first with the treasure</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I-'ong dismissed my theory just as Buck</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the floor and walls of the room in the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">his safety. I am not sure whether Traddle</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">designs anything against Miss Graves; he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is an unspeakably dirty rascal, and would</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">not know that the Sultan is interested either</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">the Sultan overhearing what I had said,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fong and Buck were a heap interested.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">They agreed, however, that this put me out</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Sultan would both think that I knew where</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the jewels were, and they would not kill me</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">until I had told. This was not so com-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forting as it might have been. They had a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">We decided that there was nothing to do</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the present, except to wait and see what</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">might happen. Buck believed that there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was a wireless somewhere on the premises,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and we knew that the Sultan had one on his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">barge, so that Candelario could have kept</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Whichever one of us saw Graves first in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">on. So we let it go at that, for the present,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and I, who were getting dressed, saw the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whole thing from our windows, and Fong</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">later told us what passed.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fong T'sai would have gone on, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Traddle stopped him. Now, like the rest</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his crowd, Traddle thought that Fong</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was just an ordinary Chink from the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Straits settlements, and would be up to any</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">deviltry.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So, seeing that there was nobod}' else</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">around, Traddle up and tells Fong T'sai</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that he knows where the jewels are, but he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">FOUR QUARTS OF RUBIES.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">285</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">does not want them particularly; all he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wants is Miss Graves. He tells Fong that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he needs the schooner to get away in, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">offers to give Fong T'sai all the jewels if</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fong will help him get off with Miss Graves.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fong looks at him steady for a minute,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then asks what about his partners.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Oh," says Traddle, with a dirty grin,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I should worry about them! Let them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stay here, if they like it. When we get</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away with the girl--"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Just at that point Fong T'sai lit into him.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I never saw a fight to beat it, either. Trad-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dle had all kinds of sand, and I judge he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had all his guns on him, but Fong never</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bothered going after a gun. He just stood</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there and began to whale Traddle with his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fists.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He landed about six times before Traddle</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">woke up to what was going on, and by that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time old Traddle was reeling and cursing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">like the bum he was. Fong doubled him up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a solar plexus blow, and Traddle</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">jerked out his armpit gun. Just as he fired,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fong hit him again and knocked him flat,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so the bullet went up in the air.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fong took the gun from him and hit him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as he got up, but Traddle jumped away and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">started to fight with his fists. He was no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slouch, either, but he was up against a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">human whirlwind. Fong T'sai had a kick</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in both fists, and in about ten seconds</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">backed Traddle down on the next terrace</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and with a few more blows had Traddle at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the edge of the lake. Traddle stood there,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his fat face all red and purple, and hollered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for help. He put his hands down and quit</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fighting altogether.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At that, Fong T'sai turned away from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him in contempt. But I saw Traddle's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hand slip into his pocket, and I remembered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that queer little gun with four barrels. So</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I let out a yell through the window, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fong turned just as Traddle fired. Then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Traddle fired a second shot, but Fong T'sai</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">did not seem to be touched. He walked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">right up to Traddle and gave him one awful</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blow that lifted fat old Traddle off his feet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and sent him head first into the lake.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">By that time, of course, there was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crowd gathered, including the Sultan and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all the rest of us; even Buck had rushed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the scene, though I stayed at the win-</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">dow. Some of the Sultan's men grabbed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Traddle out of the water just in time to get</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him out of the way of a monstrous big</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crocodile. Traddle lay there unconscious.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fong told everybody exactly what had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">happened. Miss Graves was not on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spot, so he kept back nothing. The Sultan</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wanted to hang Traddle immediately, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fong says: " No, send him down to my</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">schooner in irons and I'll take care of him."</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The Sultan said all right, and gave the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">orders. His fat steward, Tock Gump,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">called some of the soldiers; they tied Trad-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dle hand and foot and carted him off.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Thinks 1, that finishes Traddle and all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his fine schemes!</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I hurried down to the terrace, and found</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">everybody agreeing to tell Miss Graves that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Traddle was sick and had gone to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">schooner, which was to spare her feelings.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">She had seen the fight from her window,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">however, so that scheme fell through, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the Sultan cooked up another story which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">she believed. Fong T'sai had a bullet hole</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in his left arm, but it had not touched the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bone and had done no harm to mention.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was mighty thankful for that yell I had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">given him, and said he would repay me</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some day. He did, too!</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I think I have already said that the Sul-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tan had taken quite a shine to me. While</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we were at breakfast, the steward pre-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sented me with a big tray, by the Sultan's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">orders; and on the tray was a complete out-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fit of native clothes. And they were grand,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I tell you! All was of the finest silk. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vest and sash were embroidered, the sarong</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and trousers were bright red and yellow like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a Spanish flag, and all over the vest were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">little dangling gold crescents that tinkled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when I walked. Then there was a gorgeous</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sword with a blade like a flame--a kris, it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was--and it was all inlaid with gold and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">silver.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The Sultan said he hoped I would honor</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him by wearing the costume. Of course, I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had to go to our room and change, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">everybody made all kinds of fun of me.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Buck and Fong came along and helped me</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Hunting party this morning," said Fong</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">said Buck, grinning. " I emisculate why</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he sent Dave this outfit, though! Does it</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" It looks mighty grand to me," I said,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Sure," said Buck. " The suit is all</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fong T'sai smiled his queer, inscrutable</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">smile, as though he was waiting for some-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing to impress itself on us. He motioned</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I gave him the kris, and then picked up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the automatic. But there was no place to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stow it, unless I stuck it in the sash; that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">way it was mighty unhandy, and would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">show to every one. There was not even a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pants pocket. I began to think that looking</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">like a gaudy humming bird might be fine</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and grand, but had its drawbacks. Then I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw Buck looking at Fong T'sai with a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I was puzzled, of course. Then I saw</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Exactly,'' said Fong T'sai, with a little</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He took that beautiful kris in his hands,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">snug, and was quite out of sight. He and</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Well," I said, " do you think he means</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fong said no, not at all. According to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him, the Sultan was just taking precautions,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">because Kelpy had told him what a dead</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shot I was supposed to be, and the Sultan</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">took a neat and smooth way of preventing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">me carrying a gun, as he thought. That</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cheered me up some, and we went back to</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was a heap of fun made of me,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">naturally. Miss Graves said if I was only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dyed brown she would expect to get kid-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">naped or something, so I said that if I was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brown she might certainly expect it; that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">made her blush considerably, and tickled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the Sultan.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">We went hunting and had a grand time.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Whether he was at meals or anywhere, the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Perak, standing behind him; and on this oc-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">casion Lim was gun-bearer. We went into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the woods a-piece, and natives drove differ-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ent animals past us, and we shot whatever</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we had a mind to. I said I did not care to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shoot, having hurt my shoulder when I got</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">buried under the stones and dirt on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">island; so I got out of showing my ability.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But Miss Graves was a wonder with the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rifle! She and the Sultan, between them,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">did the best work. Captain Marshall had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been drinking and was unsteady, and he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was mad at the way the Sultan laid over</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him. Kelpy enjoyed himself a lot, though,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and so did all of us. They shot deer and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two panthers and some birds and a jackal</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and other things that I did not recognize.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">We had lunch out there in the woods, and</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On- the way back we passed the place</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">which was a separate building, but the little</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Well, of course that confirmed all Buck's</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">you can figure out for yourself just how</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sympathized a heap with her, and he ex-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">plained how matters were with us. She was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">right glad to hear that Leora had no notion</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">When she saw him, Kapit Ai Perang made</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The steward had seen her kiss Buck's hand,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I knew right then that she had uncovered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the Sultan's game, and I was glad of it.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Buck and I had been worried about who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was going to tell her, and how she would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">take it.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Well," I broke in, " don't try, Leora--1</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I thought it over, quick and sudden. I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the premises, myself; I was still in that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Malay costume, which I had come to like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pretty well by this time, and as long as I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wore it, they would think me unarmed and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">helpless. It looked to me as if I had better</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" All right," I said to Miss Graves.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Now, it's about three o'clock and I judge</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" You've got to act quick and sudden--</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Most girls, I reckon, would have asked</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">opened that door and ducked inside, and in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two seconds she was back again with a straw</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">So I did. What was mainly in my head</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was to pick up Kelpy and Fong and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rest on our way, but nobody seemed in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their rooms as we passed, and we went on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down-stairs. Whether we found the others</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or not, I meant to get Leora safe aboard</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the schooner without wasting any time. But</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I did want to collect the rest of our party.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As we got down-stairs, I remembered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">something, and it made me feel sick. On</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the way in from the hunt, just before Buck</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and I had paid our visit to Kapit Ai Perang,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I had heard Professor Graves and Kelpy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">talking to the Sultan about visiting his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">model plantations, which lay a couple of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">miles off to the north of the palace, away</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the river. So I judged that they had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all gone there, and I was right. Fong had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gone too, he being interested in such things</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">because he had a big rubber plantation of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his own, somewhere near Singapore. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only one who had not gone was Buck, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we met him just as we came out on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">terraces and started toward the soldiers'</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quarters to rustle up a bullock cart.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Lordy, but I was glad to see old Buck</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">drifting around there! He came up to us,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and 1 gave him no chance for any argument,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but told him quickly what Leora had heard</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over the wire and where she was going.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Now, Buck," I says, " none of your</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" All right," I said, giving him a shove</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the central stone. Maybe there's a hidden</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" You talk as if we had a motor-launch,"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">said Buck, laughing. " Come along, Miss</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I was more or less worked up and earnest</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about it, but Buck took the whole thing like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was a joke, and I was mighty proud of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the way he conducted himself. On the way</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over to the stables, he chatted and laughed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and joked with Miss Graves, but I noticed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that there was nothing loose about his voice</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or his words now. He had tightened up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">considerably.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Well, when we got to the other buildings,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out came the steward, Tock Gump. He and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Buck conversed for a minute, and I judged</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the Sultan had given orders that Miss</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Graves was to have anything she wanted,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">because Tock Gump called out a bullock</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cart in a hurry, and six of the soldiers with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it. Buck protested at that, and said that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he would sooner have the company of Tock</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Gump than that of the soldiers, which flat-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tered the fat steward and made him suspect</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nothing. So the soldiers stayed home, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Tock Gump climbed into the cart.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Watch out for him," I said to Buck.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" They'll obey him down at the village."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" By the time we get there," said Buck,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">looking a little desperate, " Tock Gump will</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be somewhere else, son. Good-by -- and</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Leora said she thought it was fine and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">grand in me to stay behind to warn her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">uncle, and although she tried to be per-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fectly natural so Tock Gump would not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suspect anything, her eyes were misty. So</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they got into the cart and we all waved otir</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hands and laughed, like it was nothing im-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I watched them out of sight. I tell you,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it made me feel blue to see them going that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">way, while I stayed behind to get old Fong</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out of it.' Of course, I was anxious about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Graves, but not in the same way.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Not knowing what else to do, I started</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">back to the palace. All of a sudden some-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing struck me as mighty queer--the stew-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He had been sent to the schooner that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">turned, and why had we heard nothing more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about what he had done with Traddle? It</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">did not look'right' to me. The more I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought about it, the more worried I got.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At the palace, there was no one to whom</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I could talk, because the Sultan was not yet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the job, and he was the only one who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spoke English. Without a guide, it would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be foolish for me to chase off into the jungle</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trying to find the rest of the crowd; so I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">got my pipe and went out on the upper</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">terrace and took a chair.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">From there I had a good view of every-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing on the location. The harem, over</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">across the lake, was enjoying some kind of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a hen party, because I could hear music</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and song; but to the eye it was dead and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">deserted. I was just thinking about it and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wishing I could have a peep at what was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">going on inside, to see if the books told the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">truth about such things, when I saw a man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">riding away from the stables and barracks.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was on horseback, but I recognized him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">right off, and it was Candelario.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Some of the soldiers stopped him, then I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saw him turn his horse and come toward me,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by himself. Other soldiers were slouching</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over toward the palace, behind me, but I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was mainly paying attention to Candelario;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his coming out in the open, that way, looked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bad. However, he did not seem to be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">armed. He rode his pony right out on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">second terrace, a few feet below me. and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">waved his hand to me as he came along.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was grinning, and the gold rings were</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Hello, senor!" he called, his voice</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I told him where he could go, and I said</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">some supplies, he was purposely cast up on the beach of Tarani, but he miscalculated the strength</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">build Jim a house, and Jim helped Barbara build a new canoe. One night some no-good whites,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">before his hut, a woman of rare but barbaric beauty came to him and suggested that he leave the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Estuban was incapable of this grim jest-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">De Socotra was in the act of springing</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">At the instant Greg made up his mind</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that he had gone up; a small, bright beam</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of light flashed athwart the upper flight</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and threw a circle on the side wall. From</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">above a voice said mockingly:</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Yes, I'm up here, Mr. Parr. Come on</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The voice did not come from the spot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whence the light issued. Evidently he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">laid his light on the floor and retreated</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from it. For an instant Greg hesitated.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then it came to him what to do. Ex-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">way up a step at a time until he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">within striking distance of the light. Tak-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing careful aim, he fired. The light went</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At the same moment he let his body relax</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and slid back down the stairs. But no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">answering shot came, as he expected. Nor</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was there any sound of running feet above.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">De Socotra as usual was bluffing. While</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the light lay on the floor he had stolen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away. Listening intently, Greg heard some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">little sounds from the fourth and top story</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the house. Snatching his light out of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ginger's hands, he sprang up the stairs.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ginger followed at his heels.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In the hall on the top floor stood a ladder</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leading to a scuttle in the roof. They</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heard De Socotra upon it working desper-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ately to raise the scuttle. But they were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">too quick for him. As they mounted the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">last flight he jumped down and ran into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the back room. There all sounds ceased.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Greg paused at the head of the stairs.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was a ticklish job to follow an armed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man into a dark room. He tried to figure</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out what De Socotra would expect him to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">do, so he could do the opposite. He had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">left the door open behind him; was it to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Leaving Ginger crouching at the turn of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">so carefully opened the door of the front</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">room. In case his man were inside, he</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">There were two doors in the back wall</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">from the second floor. He found himself</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in an extra middle room with a skylight</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through which showed the low-hanging</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Returning, he tried the other door and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">found himself in a long closet or passage</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leading to the rear. He dared not flash</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his light here for fear of giving warning</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his coming. The passage was as black</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as Erebus. The heaviness of the air con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vinced him that it was closed at the other</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">end. He crept on all fours, feeling with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his hand before him, half-expecting to lay</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it on a human figure; half-expecting mo-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mentarily to be met with a blinding flash</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and a bullet.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was stopped at last by a door which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">must lead into the room into which De</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Socotra had fled. He listened with his ear</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the crack, but could hear no sound from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the other side. If this door were locked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all his trouble would go for nothing. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">found a match and inserted it carefully in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the keyhole. It passed freely through.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The chances were it was not locked.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">If the man were still in the room there</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">no care, but suddenly flung it wide. He</seg>
