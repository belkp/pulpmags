After waving uncertainly for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, the foot was drawn back and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued forth an individual, red of visage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with blue eyes that laughed, and a figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was scarcely more rotund than a walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-stick.

Brown related several of his rail-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">road adventures, in which she was keenly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">interested. As he finished the tale of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Third-rail Hawkins and Frenchy, she in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terrupted him to ask:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Do all railroad men have nicknames,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Brown?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes.

With some misgivings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown did likewise. Now began a period</seg><seg type="columnLine">of aimless creeping and crawling, guided</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by the noises of the night, some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he thought were made by the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he pursued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once he heard a peculiar sound near</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and prepared for action; but, entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">an open space, he saw a small cascade of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dirt arising from a newly-made hole, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ltnew that it was only a badger seeking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground-squirrel for his repast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At length, in an unusually dense thicket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he scraped against something metallic. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation proved that he had stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on three large canisters of powder. Rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet, he stood motionless for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, his ears strained to catch any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound that might indicate the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hearing nothing, he stooped and pried</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the cans, laying a train of powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">from each one. Then, applying a match,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he scrambled off at top speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had gone scarcely thirty feet, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">there came a blinding flash, followed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull report. In the instant of light he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled at seeing a man directly in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. Without slackening his pace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown shot out his fist and the man fell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrendering the right-of-way without ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gument. But other figures sprang up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few moments he was the center of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently struggling mass of men. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brown went down fighting. Be it said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that before he was bound there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hardly one of his assailants who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not show marks of the conflict.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uttering no word, they marched him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the slope. He wondered vaguely if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they intended to throw him into the bay</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to drown. It soon became obvious that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not to die so easily, doming to an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">quay at the water's edge, one of the In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dians forced his jaws open and thrust the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barb of a small fish-hook into his tongue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the hook was fastened a fine wire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they forced between his teeth to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent its being held by them. He was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in a sitting posture on the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform, and the wire was made fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a floating log that was moored to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pier. This done, his captors,- one by one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glided away and disappeared in the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only then did he begin to understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">their reason for placing him there. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tide was now at its highest. When it began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ebb the log to which he was fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">would sink lower and lower until he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn over. With infinite pain he twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned until he lay face do,jvn, his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging over the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lying so, he composed himself to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wire tauten for the last time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew now what was meant by the " death-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tide." Somewhere he had heard that</seg><seg type="columnLine">among these Indians there was a super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stition against shedding the blood of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy in time of peace. In this way they</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the fate of a prisoner in the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their deity. If he chose to stop the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flow of the tide, the victim was released.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brown sighed heavily. He could stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drop out, he thought; but he had failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his duty, outwitted by a handful of In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dians. It was this that caused two bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears to mingle with the drip-drip of blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the phosphorescent water about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually the slack went out of the wire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every slight movement of the log sent a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill of agony through him. He writhed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in an effort to secure a moment's sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cease from the torture; but the inexorable</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull continued, down--down--down until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed that he would go mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, faintly, he heard a piteous cry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The strain ceased, and he was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged back to safety.

But in Europe the very thoughts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a railroad journey sends cold shivers down</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spine. Travel there is a nightmare;</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing less.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the first place, the traveler must get</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the station at least half an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the train-time to register his luggage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are no last-minute rushes to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station there, for things are not organized</seg><seg type="columnLine">diat way. Every pound of luggage, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand-bags taken into the coach, must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid for at stiff rates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hundred pounds of baggage will</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount to as much as a fare for one per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. In addition to this, four men must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be tipped to get your trunk on the train,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and four more to get it off again and up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your hotel, for the railroad does noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but haul the trunk after it has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed aboard. These eight tips per stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">are on a fixed tariff, usually amounting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighty cents. If the hotel clerk knows his</seg><seg type="columnLine">business some of them are included in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel bill and paid; then they are collected</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second time by the tippee, making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">total one dollar per town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Adding the cartage between the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the hotel, brings the total up to $1.50.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lucky, indeed, is the traveler who is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor to have a trunk.

On presentation of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">slip and the payment of four more tips, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveler gets his trunk to his hotel at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The " Comforts " of a Carriage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The luggage attended to, the next step is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to capture a seat--if you can, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang on to it--if you can. This is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation requiring no small degree of'skill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The steps'on the cars are designed to make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the compartments as nearly inaccessible as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, and besides, there are always a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of natives wanting the seat you are after,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they are more expert at scaling die</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are three classes on all continental</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads, and smoking and non-smoking com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partments for each class. Thus there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">five chances to one that you will find your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in the wrong pew when you do get</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard. To add zest to the game, there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">no separate cars for each class, but all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various classes are mixed up in each and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he is finally settled, completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">winded, the American tenderfoot finds, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his measureless disgust, that the European</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger - car, or " carriage," as they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">persist in calling it, has never developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the stage-coach idea. In England</seg><seg type="columnLine">and_Belgium particularly, there are many</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars built to represent three stage-coach</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies placed end to end, just like the ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liest cars used on die Baltimore and Ohio</seg><seg type="columnLine">away back in the thirties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Boxes on Wheels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They have four wheels like a stage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coach, though some of the larger ones have</seg><seg type="columnLine">six wheels. Both the four-wheeled and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-wheeled models were tried, found worth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, and discarded in the earliest years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad development in America. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">short journey in them is enough to reveal</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reason why such cars had so brief a</seg><seg type="columnLine">career here. Of all the bone-racking in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stigators of uncharitable thoughts that ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran on rails, they are the worst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Passengers unfortunate enough to be in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carcerated in them dare not open their</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouths to voice their dissatisfaction with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their plight for fear of having their teeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken out. The only easy riding cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in a journey extending through six</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations were on German express trains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had four-wheeled trucks somewhat af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter the American fashion.

There is the same low roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the same narrow, straight-backed seats</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed face to face that are to be found in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old stage-coach or the more modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">EUROPE'S OLD-FASHIONED RAILROADS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">593</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brougham.

When he tries to reciprocate, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangement is found to be not altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfactory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those straight-back, narrow seats, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are comfort destroyers. To recline in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortable position is impossible. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">luckless passenger must sit bolt upright, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he wears a hat the brim strikes the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the seat or the compartment wall, forcing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chin upon his breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In two minutes, he has the fidgets; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two minutes more he is in a violent temper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a little later he has abandoned all hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doing his situation justice in mere words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and has sunk into a state of coma from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he does not emerge until his destina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is reached. There is no escape by going</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a better-class car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First-class compartments are in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">car with the second-class, and there is ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely no difference between them except</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the color of the upholster}'. As the colors</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not standardized, the passenger who</seg><seg type="columnLine">pays first-class fare, which is pretty stiff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is always haunted by a dread that he may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be riding in a second-class compartment at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first-class rates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Every Convenience Is Lacking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No matter what the class or the country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the windows are invariably let down by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strap, precisely like those in a stage-coach</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a hack--that is, unless you are so un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate as to share the compartment with</seg><seg type="columnLine">native travelers. In that case the window's</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not let down. If there is anything in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe that seems to be more dreaded than</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, it is fresh air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Six or eight natives will get into one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny compartments, carefully close the</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows, or the window and the door open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the " corridor," and breathe into</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other's faces for hours at a stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">even during the hottest days of August.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, mind you, the windows are the sole</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of ventilation.

Once shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">in at a station, a passenger cannot escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the guard comes to his rescue at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next stop.

Owing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance between cars due to the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posterous buffers in universal use, the vesti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bules are long, narrow, unclean passages in</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid contrast to the familiar vestibule at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home.

In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hen-coop is a brake-staff with a short cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece with one end turned up like the letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">"L" for a handle, instead of a wheel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hen-Coops for Brakemen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lower end of the brake-staff ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minates in a screw on which a block travels</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down as the staff is turned. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">brake-chain is attached to the block; thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brakes are set as the block works up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the staff and released when it is screwed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. The pitch of the thread is below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the angle of repose, so the brake will stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">put anywhere without the use of a dog. f</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hen-coop is just large enough for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shack, or, rather, a "guard," to squeeze in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided he isn't a very big man. There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no room for him to swing himself on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brake--but there is no occasion to swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. He can set the brake with one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to the limit of the braking power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny four-wheeled car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In case of emergency, the " guard " doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hustle around setting the brakes on half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen cars, as an American brakeman</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do under similar circumstances.

To get down to figures, the average</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacity of " goods-wagons " on the Lon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don and Northwestern, which may be taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a fair sample of the rest, is seven tons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coal-cars run a little larger, many having</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stupendous capacity of ten tons, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are very few cars with a capacity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty tons.

"To git the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air," drowsily thought the huge gambler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">From there, perhaps, Mason could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cherry Creek and the Lady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'V/TASON awoke with kicking temples</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a skin that was hot and dry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight.

Then slowly he grew better,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for two months did little but sit in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun and eat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All thoughts of the new diggings had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone long ago. The country was staked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, and it would be months before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could again pound a drill or stand in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">icy water of the gulches with a pan or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That ride had been too much for Mason.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was too much for any man. But the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had cheered him that night in St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles did not let him die. A log cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">has plenty of chink-holes, hence it is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good hospital. Buffalo soup, and baked</seg><seg type="columnLine">apples at twenty-five cents apiece, are ideal</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a typhoid digestion. No other medicine</seg><seg type="columnLine">than quinin, pure water, and fresh air</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked wonders. Slowly he grew strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then did bluff Ben Holliday recall that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mason had saved his firm twenty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars. He offered Mason one thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars as a reward, which Mason prompt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly refused. Then the stage-man offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a loan--any amount. This Mason also</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again did Holliday proffer help; this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time a stock of books and stationery found</seg><seg type="columnLine">but little injured among the burned wreck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age of a raided wagon-train.

The next day St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles had its first book-store. Mason</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clerk, janitor, and proprietor. Busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was brisk. Soon, in a small way, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to lend money. His standing as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"square man" drew to him sundry little</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckskin-bags full of gold dust and nug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets for safe keeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Mason did what primitive banking St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">602</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles required. The large accounts, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Wells, Fargo &amp; Co., and all Eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">business, was of course handled by Holli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. Mason loaned a little when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to spare. Thus business prospered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. In the new diggings, forty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, many struck it rich, but more came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to St. Charles hungry and desperate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fever that Mason had cursed he now</seg><seg type="columnLine">blessed; for, bging a late arrival, he too</seg><seg type="columnLine">would probably have been among the hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gry ones. As it was, he had a good,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though modest, business, steadily growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">better. But it was not the profits that Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son valued most. He had found a gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine right on his own shelves--a bonanza</seg><seg type="columnLine">of words, . of thoughts, of feeling--his</seg><seg type="columnLine">books. Mason was his own best customer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What ruins a saloon-man makes a book-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealer. He began to keep a diary, tnot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">events alone, but also of his thoughts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressions.

In the spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 1864 it rained for ten days on the Divide</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty miles to the southeast of the head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters of Cherry Creek, yet that bed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand remained almost dry. Suddenly, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tenth day, a wall of water and liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">quicksand six to eight feet high rolled down</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cherry Creek on the helpless settlement. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the last blow of die wilderness. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">it civilization all but strangled: but the set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlement revived, lived, and to-day is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Queen City of the Plains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When darkness settled over gasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver, Cherry Creek was once more a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle litde stream, barely six feet wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rippling along in innocence.

He hunted up those he owed--they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seek him out in his misfortune--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and transferred to them the debts owed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for money loaned. This done, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left one thousand dollars, a good Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony and outfit, a clear name, and a clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ben Holliday again offered help, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mason declined with a shake of the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a silent grip of the hand. As they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to part, the Overland coach rolled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the door. An Indian arrow stuck in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leathern baggage boot behind. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coach stepped a young woman, evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her dress and manner a widow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Can you tell me where I can find Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holliday?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'm your man, madam.

It can be depended upon to en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage and justify anything on which you</seg><seg type="columnLine">set your heart. It has the pleasing quality</seg><seg type="columnLine">of agreeing with you, and of taking your</seg><seg type="columnLine">view, of concurring, assenting, and approv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. That is the reason it is so stimulating</seg><seg type="columnLine">to confide in a friend in moments of per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexity. The friend tells us what we want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear, because we put the case to him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a way that brings an amiable concurrence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, in Tom's case, the friend was right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A young man of good intent, steady pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose, and sufficient income should marry a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are twenty-five good and sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  First.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, anyway, Tom married the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">" schoolmarm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They got along well together. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved a little money--not much, but a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little girl schemed and managed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they began to see their way to the points of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending for a bungalow book, and to no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tice fancy gables, contorted dormers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pergolas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Christmas Day was coming along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tom began wondering what he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy her. He went over every page of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">department-store catalogue.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him, at length, to the patent sweeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the galvanized bread-mixer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day early in December, a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">sealed package from Chicago came to Tom's</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and into Tom's hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He startled a little to see that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressed to his wife, "Mrs. Tom Dixon,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a masculine hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It bore a conspicuous red-letter poster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">OBSERVATIONS OF A COUNTRY STATION-AGENT.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">613</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not to be delivered or opened until Christ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mas Day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the thunder's this?" said Tom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning it over and over.

"</seg><seg type="columnLine">i Tom put the package in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safe, but he got it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, examined the seals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slyly tried to pry one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them loose, but it held</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithful to its trust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 Then he adroitly ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned his wife about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">relatives and friends to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clue to one whose interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Maggie would indicate a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christmas value of fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars, with barren results,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until one day -- a-ha! -- a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman cannot keep anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">One day she let out a little--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not much, but enough.

K., Port Jervis, New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is a plug screwed into a brass thimble in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crown-sheet of the locomotive fire-box. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet is directly over the fire, and is normally</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with water to a depth of about seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches. This plug is made of an alloy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead, tin, and bismuth, in such proportion as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give the alloy a melting point somewhat higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the temperature of the water corresponding</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the steam-pressure carried. It is intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent the destruction of the crown-sheet by over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heating when the water drops to a dangerously</seg><seg type="columnLine">low level, as the melting of the plug will allow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam to escape. Of late they have been largely</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned in railroad practise through their un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reliability, because the melting point of the alloy</seg><seg type="columnLine">often rises with long exposure to heat, and scale</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming over the plug on the crown-sheet may re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sist a high-boiler pressure after the plug itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">melts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOES the cross-head of a locomotive move</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward in the guides, or does it remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">stationary until it is in the back end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guides?

If that is so, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">can the wheels revolve without drawing the cross-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head back when the cross-head is fastened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main-rod, which is in turn attached to the driver?</seg><seg type="columnLine">--E.

How would it be possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect a revolution of the driving-wheels without</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving the cross-head a complete round trip in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guides? The idea about the cross-head stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing still and the engine moving forward over it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is simply an absurdity, and it is astonishing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it should be given so much credence by men cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly qualified to know better.

You will note, however, that the cross-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heads are flying through their respective sets of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">guide-bars, and four exhausts issue from the stack</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at every revolution of the driving-wheels. Thus,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any one may appreciate that the locomotive does</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not move ahead over the cross-head, and that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">latter does move backward and forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The fact that four exhausts occur as above</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mentioned should be sufficient proof, without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reference to the testing-plant illustration.

The inventor says his</seg><seg type="columnLine">device will average twenty-five to fifty feet a day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No blasting is required, and this eliminates one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dangers and a large part of the cost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No gases collect to hinder progress of the work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three men on a shift can operate the machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The machine drills a circular hole from eight lo</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five feet in diameter. It is intended to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">through any ground that a machine drill will work</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. The track is laid and the timbers placed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine proceeds. From one hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty to two hundred horse-power is required to</seg><seg type="columnLine">operate the borer, but the cost of this is offset by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saving in men, powder, and time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A large hollow shaft is mounted on a carrying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">frame running on wheels on the track.

Upon returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Rosalia, Philip finds that he is suspected not only of old Caillo's death, but also that of Gorm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley: He decides to marry Carmita at once and take her North. On his way to see the padre for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that purpose, he is set upon by two men claiming to represent the citizens of Rosalia and dele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gated to escort Garrick out of town. Escaping from them he takes refuge in the old Mission, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">next day, accompanied by the- padre, he goes to the court-house to clear his name and aiso report</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finding of the body of one of his assailants, and there is mysteriously shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Scene in Rosalia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN a moment pandemonium reigned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the city of Rosalia.

Somebody came</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the waiting-room and approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticket-wicket. After the proper amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time had elapsed to preserve professional</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity, I looked up.

Anyhow, I took a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">look to make sure I wasn't covered with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver. Gee, but that face was a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">looker to fasten on the front of anybody's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cranium! Then I noticed the scar above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right eye. Five feet eight, and age about--</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Wot time does this yer car leave for</seg><seg type="columnLine">north?" rumbled a hoarse voice, ominously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Honk," I said.

It's a wonder he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't come with a gun in each hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick us up in regulation style, but I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wasn't his working day.

He died in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1834, leaving his machine-shops, at which</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotives were built, to his sons, George</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Charles.

In a long and elaborate</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatise, Sellers pointed out that "the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequences of running such enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">weights at high velocities over the level parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the road are ruinous in the highest de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gree to the rails and superstructure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Engines upon Engines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sellers proposed to avoid all the expense</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vexation of railroads by building them</seg><seg type="columnLine">as cheaply as possible. Instead of heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">grading he would lay his railroad on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the ground with as little prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion as possible. He would also use wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">en rails. This would bring the cost of rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roading within the reach of all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course heavy locomotives could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be used on such a road; but, then, he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want heavy locomotives. On the contrary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would build them as light as possible so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they could run at the highest speed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flimsy track without injury to it or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire machine. The only difficulty would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in getting over the hills, and he was ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a device to obviate this lone drawback.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would have a third rail in the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the track on the hills, which was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped by two horizontal driving-wheels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven through bevel-gear by a separate pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of engines placed beside the smoke-box over'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordinary engines. In order to get ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesion the horizontal drivers were connect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed by a toggle-joint to which the train was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitched, so that its whole weight hung on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizontal drivers in going up-hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The center rail was also to serve as part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a brake that was certainly effective in</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiastically approved by the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">Railroad Journal, and some of the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost railroad men of the day actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote letters indorsing the device.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Disaster in Spite of Followers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among them were Horatio Allen, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran the Stourbridge Lion, the-first locomo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive that ever turned a wheel on American</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil, who built the Charleston and Hamburg</seg><seg type="columnLine">Railroad, who played an important part in</seg><seg type="columnLine">introducing the locomotive, and who, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1848, was consulting engineer of the Erie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Railroad; John B.

Traut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wine, who next became chief engineer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the New York and Middle Coal Field Rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road in 1854, recommended Sellers locomo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives for use on grades of one hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty feet to the mile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two engines were built and, delivered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the New York and Middle Coal Field</seg><seg type="columnLine">Railroad went bankrupt, the engines were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sold, and the new owners removed the hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zontal drivers and used them as ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Sellers was pursuing his delusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its ultimate disaster, another American</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius was helping the railroads out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a variation on the same idea. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">James S.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was built on the Manchester side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, a few hundred yards above the Peters-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burg road. It was one thousand nine hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet long and had a grade of two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet to the mile except for one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet at the lower end. Like Sellers, French</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sure that what the country really need-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed was flimsy wooden railroads laid on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the ground, which could be built</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheaply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His scheme to get adhesion was to lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat iron bars six inches wide and five-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighths of an inch thick for rails. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer edges of these bars projected over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sill two and one-half inches, and as the ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ties were cut off flush with the sills</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was left a free open space for the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesion wheels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The driving-wheels were solid.

It was built in 1863</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Mount Cenis, and was actually used on</seg><seg type="columnLine">an eight-per-cent grade during the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction of that famous first Alpine tunnel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fell's railway had the usual smooth rail in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the track.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engine had two pairs of horizontal</seg><seg type="columnLine">drivers driven by bevel-gear, which could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made to press on the center rail by wedges</seg><seg type="columnLine">actuated by screws. Fell's road was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfactory and was abandoned after ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensive tests, yet it attracted so much atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that it was tried for a time on a steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">erade on the Cantogallo Railway in Brazil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and also on a steep grade in New Zealand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It really performed a great service, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. for its failure led Riggenbach to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent die first rack road, which was the Vitz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nau-Righi Railway, with grades of twen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty-five per cent, built in 1870.

After</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had danced with her until the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">became public scandal, he escorted her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expensive food hangar, and spent an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of money buying her choice viands</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would have driven his old mother fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic, had she known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as a matter of course, he introduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Rourke.

He was standing before the gage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big Atlantic, when it occurred to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a little conversation might help matters</seg><seg type="columnLine">along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Th^re is no sense in it," he said shortly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking up at Judson, who was staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">glumly out of the cab window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " There is no sense in what ?

I have seen some</seg><seg type="columnLine">very dapper widows in my time, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one leads the army.

Other evenings followed, all similar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the breach between the erstwhile good</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends began to acquire an appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of permanency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Widow Marie went calmly on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Judson had long since passed the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage of complete sanity, where she was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question, and O'Rourke took an added in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest in her because of Judson's hostile at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A WIDOW.	â€¢	685</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He visited her as often as he was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted and spent ridiculou's portions of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">salary buying her gifts.

In a cab it was almost un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearable, and Judson climbed up the ladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a temper that needed one harsh word--</seg><seg type="columnLine">just one harsh word and then devastation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Rourke was late. For the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">since his appointment to the Eastern Lim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited the fireman was behind time, and Jud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son puttered about the cab thinking of ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">propriate remarks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The excessive heat had acted directly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Rourke's disposition and he was boiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in several places when he hurried through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yards to his engine. Oddly enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judson said nothing. Neither did</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Rourke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They jolted the Atlantic out through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards and down the side-track to await the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival of the limited from the west. Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">close student of human nature could per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive at once that a cyclone was slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering in the cab. Judson poured oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the monster of steel and steam.</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Rourke busied himself in the cab and</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally cast an idle glance towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger gates where the usual hurrying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous, petulant mob waited for the lim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She came in twenty minutes late. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer and fireman had not spoken a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">to each other and it was at Scarsdale that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm broke. In the comparative silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cab, Judson looked across at</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Rourke through a wispy eddy of steam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and remarked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You're a cur, aren't you ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first the fireman simply stared across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boiler-head in mute amazement. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full force of the question struck him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his bronzed face flushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did you say?" he asked quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking intently at Judson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I said vou were a cur."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Meaning what," continued O'Rourke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still more quietly. His fingers were trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling over the wrench in his lap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I mean that and nothing else.

The shrill squeal of the air-whistle</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted him midway and he sank back. Me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanically the throttle came out under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm pull and the Eastern Limited grunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bucked as it gathered headway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I said you were a*, liar!" bellowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Rourke.

Who introduced me to that woman?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You did."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Judson heard him and turned to answer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Rourke was glaring up at him angrily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil-can in hand, with the light from the fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">box throwing flashes in his face. For five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes they yelled insults at each other--</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot; bitter words that escape from a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips when rage has the upper hand. Jud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son turned suddenly and leaped from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat straight at his fireman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Rourke threw himself aside and caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judson on his shoulder. In the same mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. the engineer swung his fist in half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle and the blow fell with a crash upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Rourke's open mouth. The fire-box door</seg><seg type="columnLine">clattered back and forth and the blaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the furnace below outlined the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men as they stood in the center of the cab</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunging wickedly at each other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Rourke dropped his oil-can and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered from the impact of the engineer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow. He forgot that he was fighting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">.-uperior officer and his heavy fist descended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocking Judson's head. The men backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from each other, poised a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then came together. O'Rourke landed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy swing and Judson fought him back</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly almost to the tender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no room for fancy fighting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cramped space.

At Lisbon, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling mass flashed by a red danger lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">at sixty-five miles an hour. Three minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, the trucks struck the open edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a switch and held. An instant later, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing train smashed into the rear of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coal train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wreck of the Atlantic was complete.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twelve Pullman coaches jammed her snort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hulk deep into the coal-cars.

Would you like to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">them ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I should be delighted," replied Clifford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the late twilight, the party started. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter of a mile back from Lynntor was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">copse, its ledges fringed with clusters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">primroses, whose blossoms shone luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the dusk. From the copse itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">came many fragrances, including those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless violets. The air was rich and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet and full of hints of small, sleepy bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">songs. In the hedges, the glowworms looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like blobs of brilliant emeralds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The squire indicated the gnarled knee of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big oak as a seat for his guest, arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">shawls on a grassy slope for his wife, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the act of lighting his brier when</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a point not far distant in the wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a tremulous burst of exquisite melody.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The squire slid quietly dowji by the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his wife, dropped his maton, and nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Clifford, who nodded in return. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen minstrel's notes grew faint, swelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, quavered, stopped, and then filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night with music.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The far-off recesses of the copse yielded</seg><seg type="columnLine">an answering song. The nearer bird replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those liquidly tender phrases that make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nightingale's hymnal so infinitely sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so entirely sad. It was, so Clifford said</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterwards, as if a lover was telling his</seg><seg type="columnLine">love to her who loved him and who yet was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddening at the moment of his triumph,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing that neither love nor beauty last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGH BY SUNRISE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">697</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then, too, there was a longing for things</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond, inspired by the music that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">woven out of the magic and mystery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect night. Clifford listening, felt much</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had not felt before. Most did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel the rebuke that the aspirational purity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tones conveyed to him. It was as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">an angel had come to him in the being of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife and children.

With a flush of self-contempt on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cheek, he beat a retreat to the dining-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, muttering things of an uncomplimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary nature about himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, when Mammy June came to clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table, she found her chicken untouched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and her employer staring at the gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee-pot as if it were a "gazing crystal"</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherein he was trying to learn his fate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour passed, and from the flat next</seg><seg type="columnLine">door came the thrill of music, followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a series of disconnected, dropping, flute-like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">phrases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was as if a string of melody had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its silvern beads were falling in rhyth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mical confusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the notes lapsed and died a</seg><seg type="columnLine">death of lingering beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came a resurrection of exquisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid tones, as of a flute played beside a</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest brook. The harmony gained strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shape, but lost none of its repressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenderness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clifford, listening, felt himself back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devon. The primroses loomed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dusk, the fragrant copse lay before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the song of the nightingale with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">its love and longing was touching the fibers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The music haunted him all the next day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From out the wreaths of misty emotion it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had evoked, there seemed to gradually shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">an interpretation of his feeling for Elaine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The love notes of the nightingale had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused something in his heart to vibrate in</seg><seg type="columnLine">unison. The silent music of the girls had</seg><seg type="columnLine">renewed the work of the "little brown bird."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a daring inspiration came to him--</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those inspirations that took imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diate action. During the day he dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in on Doure. Doure was a musician, who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he cared, might have been much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than what he was, a partner of and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">" arranger " for a well-known firm of music</seg><seg type="columnLine">publishers. He put crudc material into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crucible of his genius, and the result was</seg><seg type="columnLine">music.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doure," said Clifford, "this is a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidential mission.

I forget most of the lines, but the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">final verse ran thus:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Oli. bird, Oh! unseen bird!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Who art by night and leafy curtains liid,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Whose throat and heart alike by love are stirred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whose song into my waiting life has slid!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Oh. bird with passioned trill,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Beneath the stars above,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.Would not thy song with joy more fully thrill,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In the dear day of love?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Doure was punctual. Dinner ended, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the pair adjourned to Clifford's den, where-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in was a piano. From the flat next door</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">came the ripple of music. Doure opened</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Want to try it over?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The other nodded, but not without a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">curious tightening around his heart. Doure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">began to play.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Clifford was a fair musician as amateurs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">go and the owner of a good, robust barytone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">voice. The influences of the hour were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strong upon him, and his voice waxed more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tender with the advent of each line. Doure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had done his part magnificently, and in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pauses Clifford, under the spell of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">music, once more felt himself in the shadow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Devonshire copse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ,!Good," muttered Doure, as the song</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ended.

Wheat on the Kansas farm</seg><seg type="columnLine">means bread, sooner or later, in New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cityr or in Seattle He sends a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of wheat to market, say to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. The cost of pulling the load from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farm to the railroad by horses is about</seg><seg type="columnLine">five dollars, the cost of pulling the wheat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York City is about five dollars, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cost of cartage through the streets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York City is about two dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This twelve dollars is a part of what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bread costs when served on a New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">City dinner-table. Now, the average man</seg><seg type="columnLine">will set up a roar if the farmer gets one</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar and ten cents for his wheat instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one dollar; but he usually ignores an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crease of ten cents in the freight rate, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount? to the same thing to the final bread-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eater.

Nothing affects</seg><seg type="columnLine">the price of real estate, the monthly rent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than railroad rates. Cities have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made and ruined by changes of freight rates,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so have individuals by the tens of thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands, although, as a general rule, few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these knew what ruined them, or made their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunes, as the case may be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Mileage " and " Joint Cost " Charges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, what is a freight rate? It is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">total charge made by a railroad, or a ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a canal-boat, or a horse - and - wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">freighter, for taking anything from one place</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another. What the waiter is to the dining-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, the railroad is to the nation, the manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">facturer in this case being the cook, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">you and I sit at the tables and pay the bills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In this article we shall deal largely with</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad freight rates only, touching on ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal, ship, and wagon rates only as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">affect the railroad freight rate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first glance it looks simple enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this matter of making just freight rates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" If it costs one dollar to haul one ton one</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile, then it surely costs two dollars to haul</seg><seg type="columnLine">one ton two miles, or two tons one mile,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">argues the average individual from a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon-sense standpoint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is known as the " mileage basis," or</seg><seg type="columnLine">charging for hauling goods according to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance hauled. But soon we shall see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this apparently simple proposition is impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible in every-day practise. The "mileage</seg><seg type="columnLine">basis" is the one the public are urging,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the railroads fight for the "joint-cost"</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of charging for hauling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Multiplicity of Costs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Joint cost" is somewhat harder to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, and perhaps a simple illustration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to every one, will help to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter clearer. When you go into a restau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rant and order a twenty-five-cent meal, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">get, let us suppose, the use of the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, knife, fork, and spoon, dishes, table-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth, napkin, etc., free of apparent charge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least nothing appears on the bill for these</seg><seg type="columnLine">items; yet they must be paid for, and paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">for by the eater of the meal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE A. B. C. OF FREIGHT RATES.	713</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The meal itself consists of soup, boiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">beef, potatoes, bread and butter, coffee, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of pie. The restaurant charges only</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the meal, apparently; but it is clear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one that the bill includes a charge for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other things just mentioned, such as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes, the rent, the lights, etc. Now, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bread and butter is also free, but there is an</seg><seg type="columnLine">extra charge of five cents for another cup</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coffee, and ten cents for an extra piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This means that the restaurant-keeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes nothing on the soup. He loses money</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bread and butter. He makes only</seg><seg type="columnLine">three cents, gross, on the meat, and one cent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gross, on the potatoes, and four cents on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee, yet the whole meal yields him a final</seg><seg type="columnLine">net profit of, say, two cents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In other words, the restaurant man does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not make an equal profit on each kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food sold, but, in fact, actually loses money</seg><seg type="columnLine">on some kinds that must be served, such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bread, or the use of the table or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife and fork, but makes up this loss on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his coffee or pie. So, practically, he charges</seg><seg type="columnLine">o:- each item just " what the traffic will</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear," and by putting it all in together, turns</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a cheaper meal to the eater than if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged for each item separately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A System That Averages Up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In fact, it would be practically impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to charge the man who stayed ten minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gulped down a cup of coffee and a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pie a just proportion of the rent and light</seg><seg type="columnLine">bill, as compared with the family that spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours in the place and ate up half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">turkey. So the restaurant man meets these</seg><seg type="columnLine">"overhead charges," as they are called, by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less indefinite "joint-cost" system.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He charges twenty-five cents for certain eat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ables as a whole, and out of them nets a</seg><seg type="columnLine">profit of two cents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To attempt to charge each man his exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportion of the rent, the light, the laundry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other bills, would be to try to put into</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation the "mileage basis." In abstract</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory, this last is the proper one, no doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it cannot be put into practise. This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear enough to every one in the case of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">restaurant man, but it is not so clear in</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard to the railroad man and his freight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate charges, yet it is just as true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The average man, we will say, ships a ton</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wheat and a ton of coal from Kansas</seg><seg type="columnLine">City to Denver. The railroad charges him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, one dollar for hauling the coal and two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars for hauling the wheat, though they</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the trip in the same car, and one takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more space or makes any more trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the other. Here is where the average</seg><seg type="columnLine">man sets up a howl, and insists--with much</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, at first sight--that if the railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes a fair profit on the coal for one dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar, it is robbing him on the wheat at two</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bunching the Charges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But the fact is, that it is just as impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible in this case to figure out the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of the railroad president's salary and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the track-walker's monthly pay that the ton</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coal should bear and that the ton of wheat</seg><seg type="columnLine">should bear, as it is to figure out the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem in the restaurant case just illustra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted. The railroad must bunch the charges</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get three dollars for the two tons</seg><seg type="columnLine">--one of coal, and one of wheat--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though on the coal it makes only ten cents</seg><seg type="columnLine">profit, and on the wheat twenty cents profit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a rough way, this illustrates " joint cost "</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the railroad man uses the term when</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking of freight rates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now the plot thickens, as the dime-</seg><seg type="columnLine">novelists say. In the preceding paragraph</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have seen how the charge differs on two</seg><seg type="columnLine">different articles when hauled the same dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance in the same car. Now let us take</seg><seg type="columnLine">another case, the very bone of contention in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the present freight - rate situation that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">attractjng national attention. This is char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging less for hauling the same article, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps in the -same car, a long distance than</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a short distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Take the case, for instance, of two tons</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wheat, one going from Kansas City to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver and another, in the same car, going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on through Denver to San Francisco. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car stops at Denver, the Denver man</seg><seg type="columnLine">pays, let us say, two dollars, to cover the cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hauling the wheat from Kansas City.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The car door is locked and the car rolls</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to San Francisco. The San Francisco</seg><seg type="columnLine">man pays only one dollar to the railroad for</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving his ton of wheat twice as far as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fellow's, and the Denver man shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">till stones begin to jar loose from the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pike's Peak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Where the Shipper Kicks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rank injustice!

Here is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case. The railroad man shows that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he charged, say, three dollars to haul that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton of wheat to San Francisco, the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in San Francisco would not ship at all, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">would buy his wheat from South America,</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting it by ship from around the Horn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the southern end of South America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Railroad's Justification.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the railroad would have only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton of wheat to haul--the one to the Denver</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--and would have to charge him three</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars for hauling it from Kansas City to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver, instead of the two dollars it now</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets. The railroad must be kept up, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-dollar income will not do it.

As a matter of climax, it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be mentioned in passing, the Interstate Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merce Commission is mentioned after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Supreme Court, for the court follows to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large extent the fundamental principles</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually being worked out by the Interstate</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commerce Commission.

It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">as vital, as deeply important, as is banking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which the world has been experiment-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for centuries and has not yet solved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in banking, and in money affairs gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally, we are much farther advanced in</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical working knowledge than in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject of freight rates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the United States were as smooth as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, with the same climate throughout the</seg><seg type="columnLine">year in all parts of the country, with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">snows in winter, no Rocky Mountains to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross, no big crops to haul in the fall, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">other nations to send goods to our ports by</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, and no more people in New York City</seg><seg type="columnLine">than in Reno, Nevada, then railroad freight</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates would be a simple matter.

To set lire to the barn to kill the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rats will kill the rats all right, but how</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the barn, the live stock in winter, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farmer? Because this joint-cost system</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been, and no doubt is to-day, greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">abused in robbing the public through watered</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocks in Wall Street, this is no reason for</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning the "joint cost" barn just to kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">these financial rats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We, as a people, must pay freight charges</seg><seg type="columnLine">according to either the "mileage basis" or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "joint-cost" system.

Enough to say here, that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are no mountains to cross in this section, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide stretches of unpopulated country, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that traffic is regular enough to keep the cars</seg><seg type="columnLine">full all the year round traveling in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, east and west, west and east, north</seg><seg type="columnLine">and south, south and north--all things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply affect freight rates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, to change the subject somewhat:</seg><seg type="columnLine">The railroad man cannot talk two minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">about rates without using three terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at once cause a blank expression on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of his lay listener. Among these are</seg><seg type="columnLine">" class rates," " commodity rates," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"flat" or "blanket rates."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An Explanation of Class Rates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the witness-stand the average rate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maker can toss and juggle these pet terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his till the court-room goes round and</seg><seg type="columnLine">round to the learned judge, and even to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioning lawyer, while the man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back'seat reaches for his hat, tiptoes out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall, and takes refuge in a smoke. For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bid a railroad rate man usin? these three</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms, and you might as well put a muzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him. He can't talk, that's all there is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it! Now, let us see what they mean, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">three sacred terms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First of all, I will give an example of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"class rates." To ship a bass drum costs</seg><seg type="columnLine">more per pound than to ship iron-ore. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">drum takes more space in the car, and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">more liable to get broken. It also was placed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the train by hand, while the iron-ore is</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumped by the car-load, and nothing except</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blast furnace can change its value.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bass drums, baby-carriages, and air-ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">are more fragile, however, and such kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things are roughly grouped into a "class."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carpets, gunny-sacks, canvas, etc., might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">grouped into another "class." Crowbars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nails, chains, etc., into still another class,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These classes are constantly shifting more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less; that is, on some roads crowbars</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be in Class III, and on another road</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Class IV, but this is a minor matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enough to say that certain things more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less alike from a shipping standpoint are</seg><seg type="columnLine">classed together, and the freight charges on</seg><seg type="columnLine">all things in one class are equal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" Commodity Rates."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, if the railroad charges $1 on crow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars it also charges $1 on nails, and if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge is $5 on bass drums it is also $5</seg><seg type="columnLine">on air-ships. This is what is meant by</seg><seg type="columnLine">" class rates," and by the terms " first class,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"second class," "double first class," etc.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">depending on the nature of the goods, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads over which they go, etc. In practise</seg><seg type="columnLine">these classes are much alike on all roads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as we have seen in the case of "joint</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost," some goods will not move, as the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road man so aptly expresses it, or, in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, will not be shipped, if the charge is</seg><seg type="columnLine">too high. Take the case of nails, for in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance. We will say that both nails and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowbars are made in Chicago, and nails,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not crowbars, are made in Kansas City.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the railroad can charge $1 for crow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars from Chicago to Omaha, but if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">charges $1 on nails, then another road will</seg><seg type="columnLine">haul nails to Omaha from Kansas City for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty cents, so no nails will move out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago for Omaha. So the nails are taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of their "class" and given a "special</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate" of fifty cents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This special rate is called a " commodity</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate." The public knows what a "special</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate" is, but for some reason the railroad</seg><seg type="columnLine">man prefers to call it a " commodity rate,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">a term much less apt and clear than " special</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate." However, the railroad man does</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a "special rate" at times, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">in regard to freight what excursion rates are</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the passenger service. Now that we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen what "class rates" and "commodity</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates" are, we will take up "flat" or</seg><seg type="columnLine">"blanket" rates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">716</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">other near-by cities all want to ship goods</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Denver. Colorado, for instance. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">city has some one claim over all the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York, for instance, has a large ton-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nage to ship, while Pittsburg is nearer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it has a somewhat smaller amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods to transport.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also the kind of goods vary greatly. Pitts-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burgh ships iron and New York dresses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hats, and so on.

Just as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who buys a pound of beefsteak cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect to get the same low price as the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who buys a trainload of steers, so Fort</seg><seg type="columnLine">Collins- cannot expect to get as low a rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road rate as Denver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Pueblo, Colorado, on the other hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred and more miles to the south</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Denver, has a large trade, and is the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon business center for quite a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small towns scattered around within one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred miles or so. In other words, Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver.

This same question of terminals is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the roots at the bottom of the quarrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">between big and little cities over difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">in freight rates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We will say that a man wants to ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">two mowing-machines from Chicago; one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver and another to Littleton, Colorado,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small town -about ten miles to the south</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Denver, both machines going over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Santa Fe, which passes through Littleton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the train reaches Littleton it must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and delayed perhaps half an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">to properly switch out the car containing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mowing-machine, a delay which costs the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad at least $100, if not much more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">counting interest on the money invested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cars, engines, the crew's pay, etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In other words, the freight charge on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one mowing-machine does not pay five cents</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the dollar that it costs the railroad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop its long freight-train and deliver the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine at Littleton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hence in practise it pays better to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">both mowing-machines straight through to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver, break up the train, and, in a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two, send one of the machines back ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles to Littleton in a car loaded for Little-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton.

If the charge were</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, then the shipper would order the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine put off at Littleton but the rate to Lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tleton, via Denver, is made the same as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver and in some cases even cheaper than</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Chicago to Littleton direct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This tends, of course, to build up Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver as a business center at the expense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Littleton, and Littleton objects, giving many</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures, some of which puzzle the wisest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads.

In this case, Seattle was the Denver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Spokane the Littleton, of the example</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have quoted in the preceding paragraphs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The equally important " Reno case " is</seg><seg type="columnLine">much on the same order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Paying for the " Back Haul."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This condition of affairs is called "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back haul." That is, goods are pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a town to a big terminal, then back</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the same tracks to the town and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">local merchant is charged for the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">haul, the "direct," or "through haul," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the " back haul."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Take Spokane as a sample. Say the rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Seattle from Chicago is $1, and the rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Seattle to Spokane, over the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks, is fifty cents. The charge from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago to Spokane is then $1.50. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it takes the disposition of a saint to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the platform and see your goods roll by</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Seattle, then back to Spokane, and pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hauling them all this useless distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they might just as well be put off at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spokane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the goods were put off at Spokane, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bill is still $1.50. In other words, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad has charged you for hauling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the goods to Seattle and back, although it</seg><seg type="columnLine">718</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">has not hauled them one inch of this dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance.

"Pass a law?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just what kind of a law, please? The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who can properly word such a law</seg><seg type="columnLine">will make himself famous, for before doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he must solve one of the hardest problems</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the actual operations of a railroad. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case of Spokane and Seattle, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">places are each large enough to make them</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less equal, and the problem is tan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled, but in the case of Littleton and Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver. as I have illustrated, the same principle</seg><seg type="columnLine">appears in a much clearer manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Spokane is to have certain rights equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Seattle, then how about Littleton hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the same rights as compared to Denver?</seg><seg type="columnLine">But if Littleton has these equal rights, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">how about the lack of great switch yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Littleton? One cannot build many side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks and maintain a night-and-day signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">service at every little jerk-water station,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the freight in some cases will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">average one car a week.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now here are some of the actual physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions under which a railroad operates,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how to adjust the bills to such con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions constitutes the whole problem of</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight rates. Clearly the "mileage basis"</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not do, and the "joint cost" system</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be full of weak spots, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">combination of the two systems simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">causes new problems to spring into life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This brings us to the " zones," or certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">sections of country under a "blanket rate,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a "blanket rate" you will remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one where the charges from a collection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shipping points are the same, regardless</seg><seg type="columnLine">of conditions. In the part of the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States where "the blankets" are most used,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is, from the Atlantic seaboard to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mississippi River and north of the Ohio</seg><seg type="columnLine">River, the territory is divided into different</seg><seg type="columnLine">" zones."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For instance, say for the first hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles out of New York the charge is one</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar, for the first two hundred miles the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge is two dollars, etc., all the way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mississippi River.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now it is easily seen that such a system</seg><seg type="columnLine">of freight charges would divide the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">into "zones," according to the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from New York, Boston or any other At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantic seaboard city. There would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">" two-dollar zone," for instance, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"three-dollar zone" next to it. The charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all cities in the two-dollar zone would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">two dollars, and the charge to all cities in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "three-dollar zone" would be three</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars, and so on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this looks very nice on paper, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even works fairly well in practise, but how</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two cities near togedier, say twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles apart, one in the eastern part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"three-dollar zone," and the other in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western edge of the " two-dollar-zone? "</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here the two cities are only a short distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart, yet the charge is one-half more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one than to another. This fifty per cent</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference in freight rates from the Atlan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic seaboard spells ruin for the city in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">" three-dollar-zone," because the city so near</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in the "two-dollar-zone" will, sooner or</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, run it out of business, and reduce it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a comparatively dead town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now all this may seem merely abstract till</seg><seg type="columnLine">you own real estate in that " three-dollar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zone" city, and your rent income drops</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily every year. This, in fact, is what</seg><seg type="columnLine">is happening every day to thousands of real</seg><seg type="columnLine">estate owners, and the problem to them be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes a very live and important one, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed. Yet just how to adjust even this ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion so that things will be right all the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">round we have not yet learned. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Supreme Court of the United States does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know and does not pretend to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The usual solution proposed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-dollar-town is to demand the two-dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar rate, regardless of the fact that then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town still farther west can, on the same prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciple, demand the same two-dollar-rate, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so on till the last, the " ten-dollar-zone," is</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached. Of course this will not do, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">then we would have a " flat " rate reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear across the continent, just like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">postage-stamp system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This very postage-stamp system has even</seg><seg type="columnLine">been seriously proposed by some individuals</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a possible solution of the freight-rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem.

The ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary box-man, he found out, is usually an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ex-mechanic or artisan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He learned that yeggs always operate</seg><seg type="columnLine">in gangs, for the most part known by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader's name, as "Chi Jack's mob," or</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pitts Whitey's mob." Their true names</seg><seg type="columnLine">are never asked or given, but are replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by "monicas" derived from some personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarity or from the place of origin. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew wise in reading their records on sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions or water-tanks; such marks as "Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ed, 4119108, E," or " B.B., _2|12|09, S,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to convey much information to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He learned that the highest yegg virtue</seg><seg type="columnLine">is fidelity; its basest crime, treason. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">"bawl-out" or a "le^k," he found, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">always punished by death. Sometimes, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him, a mob would have to wait years</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get a "beefer" who turned them up;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but eventually the traitor always got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaden pill that sent him up the escape for</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The elaborate system of "giving up" or</seg><seg type="columnLine">"greasing" for protection by the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came to understand.

He heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">many tales of fights resulting from the divi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of the spoils, and, by way of contrast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to know all about the collection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">" fall-money " and the liberality of yeggs</seg><seg type="columnLine">when asked to chip in for the hiring of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">" mouthpiece " to " spring " a friend in</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ciphers of a score of kinds he learned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read and write.

All his former friends and</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquaintances he carefully avoided; where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had vanished to, none of them knew--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to care. Sometimes, of an evening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he walked abroad with Piano in strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of the city.

Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times he dropped in to a " drum " where</seg><seg type="columnLine">stale beer and vitriolic whisky were sold</seg><seg type="columnLine">at two and three cents a glass. Again, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went the rounds of some of the " doss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses"--bare and cheerless dens, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitewashed, pot-bellied stove in the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room, recruiting signs and three-cent</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunch-room ads on the walls, and discour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aging wrecks of men lolling on the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden benches, reading last week's paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came to know dozens and scores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious types, the existence of which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never even suspected when a member of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper-world.

To read that a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperadoes had swooped down upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, held it up at the point of automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolvers, blown the safe to atoms and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">camped with crackling volleys, pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">them immensely; for the truth usually was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quiet and unobtrusive as they could pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly make it.

So intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his thought that his fa&lt;e became set in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a savage scowl. He noticed that two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three people were looking at him, and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him came the guilty feeling that his true</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">occupation must be known to others--a feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing which he never could quite rid himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">of, even though reason told him he was safer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more perfectly hidden in New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">than lie could have been in the most remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">village.

They had already told Dave</seg><seg type="columnLine">that " something was doing," though just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what, they said, could not be for the pres- -</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent divulged, and had enlisted his services.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dave was a good driver, they knew.

"I tell you, this taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">of honest labor does me good. It's been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time since I've had a saw or a plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my hands.

Piano went on, casually</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough: "We'd better have plenty of room</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn around in.

Loose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly built, with considerable cracks between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boards, and lined with gunny-sacking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be no danger of suffocation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inside of each case they nailed a soap-box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to serve as a seat and also as a storage place</seg><seg type="columnLine">for tools, provisions, and the like.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lids they made in such a fashion as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give the appearance of being solidly nailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained, or seemed to, the noise that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard. He set his lantern down, shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the box back out of the way, grumbled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit, and swore. Then, with some half-mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered word about " Reportin' that Dugan to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boss in the marnin', sure! " he took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">final look and departed. His light faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and died. His footsteps echoed, dimin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, ceased.

Who could tell but what the watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man might still be listening? But what this</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be a ruse on his part to detect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">true cause of the trouble? No novices, they,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be so easily entrapped, if trap there were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, as the time lengthened and no sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached them, they gained confidence once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. Piano nudged his comrade, and cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiously stood up. Graham followed. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocketed their " smoking-irons." Present-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly they were sliding like wraiths down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor beyond the elevators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they went, Graham kept his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailing along the wall to the right. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">counted the doors: "One! Two!" His</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace slackened even more. They reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner and turned again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Here! " said he, taking Piano by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both stopped. Piano set down the sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chel, knelt, and opened it. Graham threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light on the iron door that was all which</seg><seg type="columnLine">now separated him from Dill's place of fan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">750</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cied security. He saw the combination;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, above it, a second lock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like many another vault, it had two</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastenings, one which could be opened only</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an employee, one by the tenant, thus ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely shutting out any unauthorized open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the door--" Or so they think! " re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected Graham, smiling satirically. "Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe we'll'show them a new wrinkle, eh?''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already he was at work. Piano handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the clay. He took a lump of it, stuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">it against die door immediately below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">combination, and fashioned it quickly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of shallow trough. The same opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion he repeated for the upper lock. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the clay he dropped back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taking the package of thermit, he poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">into both cups of clay a quantity of the mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velous compound. He inserted the bits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tape, which had already been cut to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand back, now!" he whispered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both men waited a moment, looking, lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Go on--set her off! " said Piano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A match flared in the black. By its wa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vering light their faces became visible, set</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eager, with eyes the pupils of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unnaturally dilated, like a cat's eyes at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Piano blinked, but Graham's gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">was steady as his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He touched the match to one tape, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other. There flashed a quick and blind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing radiance, followed by the blue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly crackling glare of the thermit. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor dripped, splashing, an ardent</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain of molten steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano looked anxiously over his shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Graham, merely smiling, stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watched the wondrous flame eat into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. Slight chance, he knew, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light should be twice or thrice reflected so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to reach the main corridor. With in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible rapidity the combination fused, lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, ran down, and dribbled along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates of steel. Graham threw in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">handful of the stuff; the metal rain in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased. Then, where the lock had been, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny hole appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It widened to a white-hot gap. Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed his eyes, which felt as though seared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A green light seemed to fill them. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, listening to the coruscating hiss of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thermit. No sweeter music in all his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever reached his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right--all right!" whispered Piano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham looked again. The stuff had</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned itself out. Now nothing was visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">but just two glowing apertures, like red-hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows in the dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " When she cools a bit! " said Graham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano tiptoed to the turn, looked and lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened, perceived no sign of danger, and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Oh, but you're the goods, bo! " breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he in admiration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "S-h-h-h! The jimmy now!" Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered, oblivious to all but the immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">task before them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few strong, skilful twists broke down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last barriers of resistance. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung inward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano seized the bag. They both entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. Graham pushed the door shut</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " At last! " he said coldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XX.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Finding--And After.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T_TE stood motionless for a second or two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">A A flashing the electric beam here, there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting his bearings. He sniffed the close</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fetid air of the long-closed place as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it had been perfume. His quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance showed him the situation of things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room he saw was very small--</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly six feet by eight. One side was</seg><seg type="columnLine">banked up with boxes and packing-cases,</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably containing the old man's most</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable books or art treasures. Some large</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat objects, wrapped in sacking, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall directly opposite the door--</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures, no doubt. Grahrm turned impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiently from these.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" queried he. "Nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">junk here, after all! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There!" answered Piano, pointing to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham turned the light that way. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicked spots of brilliance from metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham saw a safe-door, apparently built</seg><seg type="columnLine">solidly into the wall itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " There she is, Switch !

Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">knelt before the combination. Lovingly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid his ear against the steel plates. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a maestro touching a long-familiar instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, he delicately took hold with his sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitive, artistic fingers upon the knob pfjhe</seg><seg type="columnLine">device.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned it slowly, carefully, listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the while.

For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten seemed to be the perilous situation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten the presence of his companion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten even the object of his quest. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention, keen and absolute, centered</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the minute, fine, hardly perceptible</seg><seg type="columnLine">little indications there within the combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last he nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I've got it," he announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spun the knob, stopped it at 85, drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">it back to 40, then whirled it twice round.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To 20 he brought it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sixty, now, and--you see?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The action suited the words. The com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bination clicked. Graham pulled down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle, tugged a little at the door, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung it wide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano said nothing. His eyes narrowed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though, as he stood looking down at Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham's broad back. In them that strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">look had appeared once more--the look</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Graham had sometimes noticed there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though the man, Graham's one-time</seg><seg type="columnLine">teacher, harbored some secret jealousy or</seg><seg type="columnLine">some more poignant feeling. But of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham knew nothing; it passed, too, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment, in Piano's growing eagerness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> **" One more, and we're in," remarked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham, tapping the smaller inside door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Don't waste time figuring on that," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano. " It's nothing but an A B C lock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took the light in his left hand. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right he drew from the satchel the skele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton-key. Graham noticed that the key shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little as Piano fitted it into the lock. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered momentarily at this, but had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to give it more than passing thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for already the inner door was giving way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano dropped the key back into the bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pulled the door. It yielded. Dill's</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret hiding-place stood open wide at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Graham's searching eyes!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a minute he did not see the thing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought. In the drawer lay many papers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sealed packet that Piano had told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">about was hard to distinguish. He knelt</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, head bent slightly forward, hands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eager to grasp, a singular expression on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine, intelligent face, the color a trifle height-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened in his cheeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Eh? Don't see it? ''asked Piano breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For all answer Graham began taking out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contents of the drawer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were deeds, mortgages, bonds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocks--ah ! what was that ?

With</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly more emotion than as if finding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch of newspaper clippings, Graham took</seg><seg type="columnLine">back his own. Took back his property, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">justification of all that he had done; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof, the thing which was to give him once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more all that was to him far more precious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more dear, than life itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Justice!" Piano heard him say. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one word, as he slid the bundle into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breast-pocket; then, without rising from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees, began carefully laying the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers back into the drawer again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano stared at him, amazed. The yegg's</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw dropped. He frowned with astonished</seg><seg type="columnLine">displeasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Say, Switch!

The stab</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flame from the heavy - calibered pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">singed his hair.

Then, on the stairs above he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the men's feet climbing higher still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A daring ruse occurred to Graham. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued from the corner where he had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge, and as the. men went on up-stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">he followed them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The windows all up and down the stair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way helped him greatly. He neither hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated nor stumbled; he made no slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound.

To his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the idea of seeking refuge among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">piles of freight out by the elevators; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this plan he at once abandoned. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes, he knew, could at best give him but</seg><seg type="columnLine">very brief respite. If he hid there, he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely be caught.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this momentous game of hide-and-seek,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon which all his future, all his life, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended, he must at all hazards keep clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and free of entanglements. Even a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchmen, he Lit certain, could not suffice</seg><seg type="columnLine">to entrap him in those many, dark, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding hallways. If he could only outwit</seg><seg type="columnLine">them until he could reach the top floor--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but after that, who could say? He set his</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw and vowed that once there, nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">should stop him. Forgotten was his scorched</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, where Piano's shot had grazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the watchmen were climbing again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again he followed. This brought him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seventh floor, while they were poking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about on die eighth. But now he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds below him. Reenforcements were</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming! Suddenly a shot cracked. Sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a scuffle burst out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up from below rose a voice of command:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You big stiffs. Here, you, what you</seg><seg type="columnLine">doin'? We got him!" Shouts followed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">came another shot, a howl, an oath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham, fully realizing what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened, shrank back into the hallway cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">responding to the one leading down there</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, from the vault to the stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard feet running rapidly down, clat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering heavily in confusion. The watchmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the floor where he was concealed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment his heart stopped still. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">five yards from him the searchers were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suppose they should happen to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the passage where he stood all</seg><seg type="columnLine">open and defenseless? But, no--on they</seg><seg type="columnLine">went, on and down the stairs again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Graham realized with a thrill of exulta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that now all the men were below him!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now nothing intervened between him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top floor. Thanks to the stupidity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men themselves, and the diversion caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their finding Piano, his way stood clear!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Dom funny how we missed 'im--how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got down there ag'in when I seen him</seg><seg type="columnLine">wid me own eyes runnin' up!" he heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the descending watchmen exclaim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not wait for more, but quickly stole</seg><seg type="columnLine">away up, ever up, still with the precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">packet safely in his keeping, still with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satchel gripped in his right hand. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol he did not draw, but kept that for</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme emergencies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took him but a few minutes to attain</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper story of the tremendous building.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he went, the light, though still very dim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept growing a bit stronger; it served him</seg><seg type="columnLine">passably well. Inasmuch as he did not yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare to use the electric flash, he thanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate that the warehouse windows opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the courtyard were not shuttered as were</seg><seg type="columnLine">those that overlooked the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the top floor he stood still, listening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His heart pounded with the exertion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, fast climb, and with the excitement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chase. Far down below, the sounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle had subsided. Piano, he knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was either dead or had been made a prisoner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The watchmen by now, he felt positive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have recognized their mistake; must</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that there had been two intruders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one of these "had succeeded in giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the slip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a matter of fact, it seemed to him they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were coming up again, some of them; though</seg><seg type="columnLine">every sound in that echoing, maze-like place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so broken, enlarged, and distorted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found it difficult to tell just what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " At any rate, out's the word for me! "</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hurried along the hallway skirting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the courtyard, looking for one of the sky-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights that Piano had assured him were</seg><seg type="columnLine">there--but all in vain. Cautiously, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went, he raised the flash-lamp high in air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pressed the button, throwing the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">silvery beam up against the ceiling of fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick. No skylight! No trap-door! No</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening of any kind!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What? " thought Graham. "Penned in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all I've been through? After all I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, and suffered--just at the very last</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, just within an ace of going free, shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">I be caged up here like a rat and taken by</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE STEELED CONSCIENCE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">755</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">those idiots? By God, I won't! Not while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have life! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He reached a turning to the right, took it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sped silently along the west side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">court.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At his left he vaguely saw a row of doors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with here and there the gaping mouth of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hallway; at his right, windows that looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the yard, twelve stories below--</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows all heavily barred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped, peered through into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, and pondered. Where, thought he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the skylights that Piano had reported ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not know, nor could he, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">architects' plan had been changed in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect. Puzzled and confused, he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there to breathe, to rest an instant. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed a hand to the singed spot on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A light, below him and off to the right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew his attention. Through the windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the south side of the court he saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern swinging upward; saw legs moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a flight of stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After me, again!" he realized. Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away echoed the sound of footsteps climb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, climbing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Desperate, he ran forward once more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It's no use," said he. " This game of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tag, with me for It, can't last long. They'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">get me sure, this way--if not now, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">later.

' Better, ten thousand times! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he peered through a window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Above it, perhaps three feet from the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its bars, projected a broad cornice. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, he hoped, he might lie able to swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself up onto the roof, and from the roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">what possibilities of escape might not exist?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scrutinized the window-pane, vaguely</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen by the infiltering dim light that al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways hangs above a city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "H-m-m-m!

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saying no further word, he opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satchel, took out the jimmy, the remainder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the powder and tape, and set them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a quick, firm blow he struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jimmy through the glass, and one by one</seg><seg type="columnLine">began twisting the wires off. The glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">held by the wires, fell only in small pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham shoved these out, so that they fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the court, a hundred and twenty feet be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. The slight noise he made could hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, he felt certain, reach the ascending</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchmen way round on the other side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great warehouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In less than two minutes he had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wires all about the pane, had lifted out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass and laid it noiselessly on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the satchel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There remained, then, only the bars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the base of two of these he dumped all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remaining thermit and hastily set it off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stuff, so potent with steel, ate the mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought-iron like so much wood.

He could see nothing, there below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save a black, fathomless gulf. The court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard was wholly lost in shadow. Above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cornice made a dark line across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray night-sky.

It terminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply, fifty or sixty feet away. Beyond it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was another flat roof, somewhat lower.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There, he felt positive, must be a skylight or</seg><seg type="columnLine">some means of getting down to the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, here goes," said Graham.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Erect on the very edge of the warehouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof he stood. Right on the eaves he bal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anced. A shout, behind him, and feet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck out a tattoo over the gravel, told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been seen. He only smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Too late, now, for you to take a hand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this! " he cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Coolly he judged the distance, as so often</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had done in the University gym. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he clenched his fists, crouched, paused a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second--and launched out, down, into emp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Despite his careful judgment and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill, the shock all but stunned him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath was driven from his body. He lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, dazed and gasping, conscious only of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing--diat he had struck the ridge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was not sliding down the roof, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must hold on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then came the realization that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stay where he was. Painfully dragging</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself along the slippery peak, he crept .</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. A sharp pain in his right leg told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he had injured it, though how badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not tell. In his tense excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">he put the pain out of mind, and kept on, on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with die steep, slippery precipice yawning</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him at either hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He reached the farther end of the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From behind him he heard shouts. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusillade crackled.

To it he fell, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than jumped. He hobbled grotesquely off</seg><seg type="columnLine">along it. A housing loomed in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Round it he dodged, out of range of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolvers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw a door. All but exhausted he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried it. The door resisted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maddened then, as though by the long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage succession of pursuit and suffering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he flung his whole strength against it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something broke. The door swung open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham staggered in, holding the latch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vaguely he heard the disappointed shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and oaths fron\ the warehouse; they seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">very far, very strange.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood there an instant, swaying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloom, still clinging to the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Where am I ?

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As though the reproof had been spoken</seg><seg type="columnLine">in scorn by some one else, he pulled to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether.

On the opposite sidewalk he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">two patrolmen running, full drive, toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warehouse.

And we operators would ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vocate Morse's views too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On this road, I Cumberland Valley Railroad Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany] of 116 miles single track, and, possibly, 50</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles double track, I have not heard of an operator</seg><seg type="columnLine">that likes the telephones. I will not say, " tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone system," as it can not be called a system,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for various reasons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  First: As the operator cannot be at the phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than half the time he does not know whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scheduled trains are running on time or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether they are two hours late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Second: He does not know whether there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">any extras out; and, if there are, whether within</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or ten miles of his station.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Consequently, when he hears a train whistling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rushes out and looks up and down the track, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are curves near the office, to see which way</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train is coming. When he ascertains its</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, he rushes back into the office and gives</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train the proper signal, not knowing whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train is No. 79, 83, or 85, unless he can judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the make-up of the train. The poor, unpro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tected operator is working in the dark, no one but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the despatcher knowing what is going on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Third : When the operator wishes to talk to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">despatcher, he has not time to stay at the phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">for half an hour at a time, consequently he must go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the phone, take down the receiver and ascer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain if the line is busy. If he finds it busy, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare not break in. He goes back to the ticket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">window and waits on half a dozen customers, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">steals another minute and tries again with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same result. He repeats this operation probably a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen times, gets disgusted and swears he will go</seg><seg type="columnLine">where there are no phones--and do you blame</seg><seg type="columnLine">him ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Heretofore, under the telegraph system, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">despatcher called for an order, the operator could</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer up and then resume his .ticket-selling until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the despatcher had raised all the offices he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the order. Now he must stay at the phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">until several offices are raised and all have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated the order, while behind him he hears the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttering of impatient, scolding passengers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would it be any wonder then that he would get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the order wrong, when he divides his attention be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween what is going over the phone and what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers are scolding about?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fourth : There are so many words sound alike</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the phone, and the operator may think he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and be wrong all the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many people have a mistaken idea that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone is the faster. I have a " learner's " instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment in this office and have experimented on it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the following result: Order repealed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the operator on the phone was two-thirds</seg><seg type="columnLine">done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To sum it up in a few words, railroading has</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost its charm. Heretofore the op., no matter in</seg><seg type="columnLine">what part of the building he happened to be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could listen to the merry hum of the instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">and know as much about the location of the trains</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the despatcher himself--and it was music to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears. Now he must put the harness over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cranium, and, amid the hum of various noises like</seg><seg type="columnLine">so many horses going into a barn, endeavor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">762</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pick out what he is supposed to get, while a mob</seg><seg type="columnLine">of angry passengers are making a break for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train without tickets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leverman. who, heretofore, listened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments and threw levers at the same time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">must wait until the despatcher sees fit no allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to leav :he phone. If he fails to get the track</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined up properly for the approaching train, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">means ninety days in the pie-house for him, or.</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps, dismissal from the service.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Do you, readers, call that a "system?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under the telegraph system, the operator knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a train was nearing his station and knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what orders he had.

Every day shipments go off, every day money conies in. You could hardly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve how little they lose.
