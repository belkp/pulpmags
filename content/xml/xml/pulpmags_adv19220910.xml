Most of the important finds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in a great stone chest weighing several</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons, almost the exact counterpart of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">so-called sarcophagus in the King's Cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber in the Great Pyramid, only having a lid</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fits tightly in place.

Then, with the aid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gulad and ten men, we lifted the lid back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cemented up the breach we had made in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temple wall, pulled down about a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross-pieces of timber from the roof of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel, so as to let the sand fall in and close</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passage against thieves, and came</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, leaving Gulad on the spot in charge."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ye understand," put in Allison, "we</seg><seg type="columnLine">never mistrusted Gulad for a minute."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Never for a minute," Brice agreed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He was as enthusiastic as ourselves. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to sit and talk with us in the evenings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">displaying an intricate knowledge of Bible</seg><seg type="columnLine">history.

When we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cairo Galbraith, the official we had to see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was away, and we had to wait three days</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When Galbraith returned--he arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">at midnight, and we kept him up all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night talking, though he was tired out--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought our news so important that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up his mind to return with us and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">our find uncovered in his presence. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant more delay. One way and another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was eleven days after our departure</seg><seg type="columnLine">before we arrived with Galbraith at sunset,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired and hungry on the scene of our exca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vations.

Nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Egyptian darkness, and the black mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tunnel leading underground! We slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tunnel that night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak for yourself!" remarked Allison</seg><seg type="columnLine">dryly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When morning came there was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim light down the tunnel, for it points</seg><seg type="columnLine">due eastward, and for a short while the ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sun penetrates almost to the end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We saw then that the tunnel was not as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had left it. The overhead beams had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been replaced, the loose sand carried out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then three beams had been removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to let sand once more block the tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel. In other words, somebody had paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">a visit to our find.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was three more days before we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get together another gang and dig through</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our temple. The digging took another</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole day and then we saw that whoever</seg><seg type="columnLine">had paid the visit in our absence hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken the trouble to reset the masonry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hole yawned as wide as if we'd never</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocked it up, and nearly all the stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pushed inside the building."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I examined the cement at once," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allison.

My previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental picture of Moses had been taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cover of a school atlas. I imagined</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man w;th whiskers like those of the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Liskeard in the limerick, breaking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fury two stone tablets by the light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning, and kicking over a golden calf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while crowds of Israelites prostrated them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves in terror before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The picture I had in mind of him was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic--six or seven times as big as other</seg><seg type="columnLine">men--clothed in a thing like a purple bath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe and with his toes sticking out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandals that suggested seven-league boots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This man had Jewish features subtly</seg><seg type="columnLine">modified to pass Egyptian scrutiny. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard was trimmed and curled like those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the statues of Pharaoh, and the head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress was the linen one of ancient Egypt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">including the jeweled brow-band shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a snake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet it hadn't been done by an Egyptian</seg><seg type="columnLine">artist.

One or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Americans declared she was a rank im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">postor, but that was very likely personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">pique. She was apparently more of a social</seg><seg type="columnLine">climber than a politician. Impostor hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed the right word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She was living in a pretty good house</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the city walls that she had coaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Administration at a low rent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had a way of worshiping a handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">British officer that some of them couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily resist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forty, I should say she is--forty-two--</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere around that age.

Accord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to Grim, this mutual acquaintance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that in West Virginia Isobel Aintree</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a name to conjure with.

She said she felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her mission in life was to benefit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored people and she had hopes that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect would grow.

Scores of people have</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried the same sort of thing, and a few have</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded. Most of them go to the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner or later. It looked like a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of personal ambition masquerading as</seg><seg type="columnLine">divine fire. But Grim asked her quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually when she had seen Gulad last,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her whole character lay bare that</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She wanted to lie, but that hen-pecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">person was watching her as if pearls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">price were pouring from her lips.

She hinted it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to go, but he sat still and flattered her</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little more. That woman can eat up</seg><seg type="columnLine">flattery like a furnace swallowing coal. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that he should think she was the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman to make something of Gulad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'The fellow needs a guiding hand,' he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her.

" 'She's the kind of person,' he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'who likes to save the world by making her</seg><seg type="columnLine">followers take chances.

Quite a number were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors, who had deserted under your pecu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liar shipping law. Some were harder to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count for on any theory of lawful activity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they all seemed to eke out a living, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few were prosperous.

Four or five seemed to be well</seg><seg type="columnLine">educated, and at least one--a man named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moses Miles--had a bank account. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want you to notice that name Moses; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved to be an important clue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We let Moses Miles carefully alone at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, and made a study of the others.

The two</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper incisors touched her lower lip, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the key to her character--vampire</seg><seg type="columnLine">will-power, drawing sustenance from living</seg><seg type="columnLine">people.

The floor of the room below was</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged to seat about a hundred people</seg><seg type="columnLine">on inexpensive folding chairs, and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end opposite to the gallery was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform covered with red carpet, against</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, along one side, stood a piano that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had decidedly seen better days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a pile of reserve chairs stacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the gallery railing near one end;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I spread those out a little, cautioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aloysius Jackson, and shut myself in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The only entertainment during the hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">that followed was provided by a rat, whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity devoured, but who stubbornly</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to make friends because I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">food to offer him except tobacco.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the sound of voices, foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps on the stairs below, a snatch of song</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the jingle of keys, followed by Aloysius</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackson opening the door to search the gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lery for strangers. The lights in the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">were switched on suddenly, and the fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Jackson's face was something to marvel</seg><seg type="columnLine">at. He shut the door behind him, walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length of the gallery noisily to call at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention to the fact that he was doing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty, cautioned me with a finger raised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lips, and let himself out again, slam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming the door with a noise like a thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clap.

They didn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift their feet or glance about.

I believe jyou will find that there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">some much abler man or woman behind her, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">uses her for a stalking horse to hide his or her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">identity. Whoever it is certainly displays a knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the native races far beyond the ordinary as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as an understanding of crowd-psychology in</seg><seg type="columnLine">general.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If you examine Mrs. Aintree's antecedents you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may discover from whom she got her ideas. They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctly second-hand. And my advice is the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">old stuff I was always rubbing into you when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted together in Arab country. Get close. Be</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient. Stay on the job until you force a show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. Appear to give the enemy a free hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stop, Look, Listen!" Watch out you don't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">murdered. Mrs. Aintree, I think, would draw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line at murder personally, but not impersonally.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know her sort; they preach, and some fanatic does</seg><seg type="columnLine">the killing, as happened in the case of Lincoln and</seg><seg type="columnLine">McKinley and lots of others I could mention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above all, don't be discouraged by official cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and what may look like official impediments</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in your way. Don't talk, or consult au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorities. Root right in until you've found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual who's really running things, and then go</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him bald-headed. Yours for peace without</seg><seg type="columnLine">perquisites.--Grim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a matter of fact we had already fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed in most respects the line Grim recom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mended. For instance, we had looked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Aintree's past, and nothing could af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford better proof of Grim's almost uncanny</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment than the result of our inquiries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had been connected with a School of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esoteric Thought conducted in Boston,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Massachusetts, by an East Indian named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pananda, whose teachings had had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable vogue until Mrs. Aintree, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to have been his favorite pupil, led</seg><seg type="columnLine">a revolt against him and tried to set up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">school of her own in opposition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I MADE a trip to Boston and</seg><seg type="columnLine">called on this man Pananda. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was living in style in a house in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fenway, had a Chinese butler, and kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">me waiting in an extravagantly furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moses and Mrs. Aintree</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">anteroom for three quarters of an hour as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he were an up-to-date physician with a fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ionable practise. I might have been more</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed by his importance if there had '</seg><seg type="columnLine">been anybody else on the waiting list, or if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hadn't been curious enough to look about</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. There was a peculiar arrangement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirrors in the room that brought to mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the somewhat similar arrangement in Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aintree's apartment, so I sat still and ex- .</seg><seg type="columnLine">amined them, going about it as carefully as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I knew I were being watched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mirrors are mighty puzzling things, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less you are accustomed to manipulating</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. If you don't believe that, just ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">range a piece of paper so that you can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in a mirror, and without looking at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, but observing its reflection in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass, try to draw a square and then to cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">the square with diagonal lines. It was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time before I had figured out that</seg><seg type="columnLine">those mirrors were so arranged that a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son looking into one of them from one angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get a full view of anyone who hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to be in the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't so difficult after that to discover</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the point from which the view was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be had was in the middle of the wall above</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I was sitting, so that I had my back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the view-point and face toward the light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I chose another chair and examined that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. There were two mirrors, draped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificent eastern hangings, and between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them a thing shaped like a Persian shield,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only instead of being solid it was pierced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to form an intricate pattern. Anyone could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see easily through its interstices, provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were a corresponding hole in the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind it, but he would have to be standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a support of some kind, because the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the shield was more than six feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the floor. I returned to the first chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set my foot on it, with the idea of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amining the shield more closely, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly at that instant that the Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">butler opened the door to announce that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swami Pananda would see me. He saw my</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot on the chair, but made no comment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was ushered into a large, square room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung like the first with Eastern draperies</seg><seg type="columnLine">but containing very little other furniture.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A. magnificent carpet covered the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and at one end of the room were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short couch and an armchair made of teak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Against the wall on my left, at a point that</seg><seg type="columnLine">corresponded with the Persian shield in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anteroom was a gilded image of the Bhudda,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an enormous thing more than eight feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">high, and the large plate-glass windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite suffused it with light, making it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one outstanding object in the room. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole effect was sumptuous, yet magnifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently simple and produced a far from dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreeable impression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pananda was seated on the couch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose to meet me. He was a rather fat man</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not flabby, dressed in semi-Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes of yellow silk--a sort of comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">compromise between the easiness of India</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Western notions about decorum. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore yellow silk socks and yellow, soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">morocco-leather slippers, but no jewelry</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever. For the rest, he was a mild-look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing person with remarkable brown eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rather bulging, broad forehead half-con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed under a yellow silk turban, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile that was winning, to say the least of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Welcome, Mr. Ramsden. Pray take</seg><seg type="columnLine">that easy chair. So; you came to talk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, but I shall do most of the talking, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit. You saw through my little device</seg><seg type="columnLine">for analyzing visitors; my Chinese butler</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted your investigation; it's part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his business to keep an eye on strangers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You'd be interested, I daresay, to see how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrangement works; the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buddha swings outward on a hinge--look!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got off the couch and showed me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing a very simple spring catch behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Buddha's ear. The whole head swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward like the leaf of a door, disclosing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear of the Persian shield through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small hole in the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see? By standing on the Buddha's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lap I can observe anyone in the next room</seg><seg type="columnLine">from every angle.

She told me something of her great</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans, and begged me to tell her how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage an individual named Gulad, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to be giving her a lot of trouble. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">interviewed this Gulad, and he was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry with her for having summoned me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He accused her of talking too much, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave me to understand that she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially indiscreet toward a man whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">name he didn't mention, but who he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to see her one evening.

When you sat down in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">anteroom I noticed that you recognized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same arrangement. I had quite a little fun</seg><seg type="columnLine">observing how long you took to puzzle out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sequence of reflections from mirror to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror. Gulad had described to me an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual fairly well answering your descrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I have in my pocket a letter from Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aintree, in which she complains that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">agency in no way connected with the police</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">is--to use her eloquent description--camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on her trail.

When my</seg><seg type="columnLine">butler brought your card I added all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">together and the total amounted to Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeff Ramsden here to ask questions about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Aintree. Not very clever, was I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you intend to answer my questions?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly.

Well, as your expression sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested a moment ago, I am something of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountebank, it is true, but a rather more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than usually honest one. I used to be an</seg><seg type="columnLine">altruist, as I- thought, pure and simple, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">have awakened since to consciousness of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vein of absurdity underlying all my efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to improve the human race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My diligent and more promising pupils</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly deserted me in a half-taught condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, as Mrs. Aintree did, for instance, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set up in opposition, sometimes even going</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far as to denounce me as an impostor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stupid pupils simply wouldn't learn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what they did learn often disagreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them.

I make the rich ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay, believe me! To that extent I am a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountebank. I frequently charge for per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming tricks as simple as the one I played</seg><seg type="columnLine">on you just now. On the other hand, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve I do no harm in the world, and I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have frequently done good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No harm in the world?"

He has excited</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ambition and fed it; and now he makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">her believe that with one stroke of the wand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so to speak, he can throw her in the discard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and deprive her of all chance to attain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence over people that she yearns for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should she come to you for advice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she thinks so highly of Bhopal Gosh?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because he has left her in New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rather more responsibility than she can</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage. Mere ambition, Mr. Ramsden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't confer ability. She has what Freud</seg><seg type="columnLine">might call the emperor-complex.

But the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps are the easiest and the most deceptive;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they lead to a stage of bewilderment, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she has reached. And in that peculiar stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mind she sent for me to give her good</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice, having so far lost her sense of right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrong under Bhopal Gosh's tuition</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she actually believed I would help her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consummate his evil purposes in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence. She said that as my former pupil</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was entitled to advice from me. Well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so she is.

He makes his preparations a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long while ahead. The mere fact that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has started on a journey, let us say west-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, is no proof that the East is not his</seg><seg type="columnLine">real objective. He has made a tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of money, because some of his pu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pils have been successful in business, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has been easy for him to get inside knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of stock exchange transactions. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his pupils, who afterwards went to prison,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the confidence of one of the larg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est brokers in Boston.

No knife was found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the wound under the ribs on the left side is</seg><seg type="columnLine">several inches long.

His eyes were large,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy-lidded and cunning, and there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scar underneath the right one. The in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual features were strong and not ill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportioned. Taken together they de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picted an immeasurable guile, contempt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other people's intelligence, and ruthlessness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strong-room clerk told me that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's physical strength was prodigious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had put the contents of the strong-box</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a leather valise, and had carried it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one hand with less apparent effort than</seg><seg type="columnLine">most men would seem to exert if the bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">were empty, although the weight had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the valise sag out of shape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> - "I'd hate to be the cop who has to tackle</seg><seg type="columnLine">him," said the clerk, as he affixed the bank's</seg><seg type="columnLine">seal to the empty strong-box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next step was to track down the taxi</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which Simon Borrow had driven away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that presented no difficulties.

That</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurring to him as peculiar, he had followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">!he omnibus back for several blocks out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">idle curiosity, and recalled its number. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that got us nowhere.

She sent out word</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was indisposed, but I answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she could choose between interviewing</seg><seg type="columnLine">me or the police, and she decided to see me</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in the room with the mirrors. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was black-angry. The creases in her fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head resembled a devil's finger-marks, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wonderful blue eyes were alight with</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I analyzed as treachery. If ever a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man or woman stood ready to throw over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole cause to save herself, that one was</seg><seg type="columnLine">she--or so I read the situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Have you seen the police?"

I won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">say he aroused our suspicions, because after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the event you always think you were sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picious from the first; that's human nature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We told one another we had suspected him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I'm inclined to believe that we fooled</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves on that score.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Allison refused to sleep in a compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment by himself because he had the gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate in his satchel, and Brice, being rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired of him in some ways, begged me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take turns sharing the responsibility. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first night out Allison and I slept to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, and Brice alone; but there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door between the two compartments that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we left unlocked. Brice, having nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to worry about, and not being a nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of man, forgot to lock the other door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his compartment leading into the corridor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Brice was in compartment A, in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of us had sat talking all the afternoon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had the upper berth in compartment B,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Allison the lower, with the satchel</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his pillow; and for a long time after</seg><seg type="columnLine">we put the lights out Allison lay under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath me, quoting pessimistic verses from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Book of the Lamentations of Jeremiah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I'm not a miserable-minded man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It gets my goat to have to listen too long</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a sermon on original sin. I believe in</seg><seg type="columnLine">original decency--monkeys are perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended from man, for instance, cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly not man from monkeys--just as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe in original gold in the everlasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills. The only thing I ever knew, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">toothache, that could make me sleepless</seg><seg type="columnLine">is just such a sermon on the baseness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human race as Allison got off his chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night. So I lay awake, listening to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brice's snoring and wishing that Allison</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't set his suit-case so as to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door from closing by about an inch. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was too lazy to get down and move the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was about midnight when I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of Brice's compartment open softly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment I thought it was Brice on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prowl. But he snored on, and I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door click shut again, as if some pussy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot had sneaked in. Then Allison, fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep, started pitching about as if under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">going in imagination all the torments fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">told by Jeremiah. I took advantage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that disturbance to get down from the up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per berth without making much noise, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of opening the door between the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartments, which would only have</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared the intruder into flight, I slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the corridor through the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment B, closed it behind me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked forward to the door of compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment A.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I moved the latch, and let the door swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">open as if the intruder hadn't fastened it</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him and the motion of the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done the rest--then stood back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly lighted corridor and looked in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was our white-haired acquaintance</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter, black morning coat and all. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the door swing open, but I was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to see him withdraw his hand from</seg><seg type="columnLine">under Brice's pillow. He started to close</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door again, and actually had his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it when he caught sight of me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I've met with gall from Maine to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shanghai, all the way around the earth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and back again--all sorts, all grades, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all degrees; but nothing to equal his. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess you've got to be meek before you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of such a thesis as he propounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I came to stop Mr. Brice from snoring,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "He's annoying Mrs. Aintree."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Aintree's compartment was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front end of the car, at least fifty feet away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and between ours and hers were thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored .men, putting up among them such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a saw-mill chorus as you'd never hear any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where outside of a lumber camp or a kraal</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Africa. I pushed him back into Brice's</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment and turned the light on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">locking the door behind me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, really!" he exclaimed; and Brice</seg><seg type="columnLine">woke up with a start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fHpflf THE next thing Allison came stalk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the communicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">iilSlill door with an old-fashioned duel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-pistol cocked in front of him. In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pajamas, with that pained, intense expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion on his face and his long nose following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pistol's aim, he looked like one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartoons of a Frenchman hunting sparrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they used to print in England when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fashoda was the main topic of discussion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked him to put the pistol away, for I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen accidents happen with thosQ things;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he wouldn't listen to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, really!" remarked the silver-haired</seg><seg type="columnLine">intruder for the second time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ye'll know it's real when ye've a bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ye!" answered Allison. "Disar-r-m the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, one of ye!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You might as well have talked about</seg><seg type="columnLine">disarming an old woman. If he had had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon--and he had none--it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been perfectly safe to leave him in posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of it. He wasn't exactly frightened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was more like Daniel in the lion's den,</seg><seg type="columnLine">obedient to what he considered first prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciples and confident that some way of es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cape would open out--a much more diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult kind of man to deal with than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blustering sort, who always throw their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands up when weapons fail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sit down in that corner," I said, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell us what you were looking for under</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brice's pillow.

He never once looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. The impression I got was that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hurrying to reach his own end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car before he should be seen by someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">else. If that was so he didn't make it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he passed midway down the car the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtain of a lower berth drew back, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kinky, dusky head appeared. It- wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity that drew that head out, but con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiracy. The difference in expression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those two emotions is far too wide to permit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mistake. Carter appeared disconcerted</seg><seg type="columnLine">--really disconcerted for the first time---</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered something hurriedly, and passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. The kinky head grinned and retired</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the curtains, but only for a minute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for as soon as Carter had regained his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartment I went and pulled those cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains aside again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sam!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thah?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had two false front teeth, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed at night, and couldn't speak at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hour without lisping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Follow me down to compartment A."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He struggled into his overcoat, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">more like a chimpanzee than a human,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although owning a good-natured grin that</seg><seg type="columnLine">offset certain other peculiarities.

There were a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">truck gardens, the inevitable roped cows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unthrifty-looking goats by the dozen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course pigs, but nothing that resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">farming. It looked like one of those places</seg><seg type="columnLine">that import everything in tin cans, milk</seg><seg type="columnLine">included, and the empty cans made up most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the scenery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet it wasn't such a small place. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently spread during the war, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun to dwindle subsequently. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">straggling, outlying parts of the town con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted of mere shacks, no longer painted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabited exclusively by colored folk, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come there for wartime wages and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained because it was the easiest thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. There were rows and rows of empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottages, and the white folks' houses, on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill at one end of the town, wore a deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">look, as did most of the mines, although the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit-head gear in places appeared to be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">working order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Take it on the whole, Appleton was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect a place as you could find for brew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing discontent. You could hardly be happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">there if you tried, what with falling wages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling population, falling houses, trade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambition, everything. Mrs. Aintree</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out her home--a large frame house</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a hill-top, standing in considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds, but empty, and I didn't wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she lacked desire to live in it. She said</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her late husband had controlled half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mines in the place, but the coal was low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grade stuff and hardly paid for mining any</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Aintree had engaged the town hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten days in advance, and the place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">placarded with notices of a P. 0. P. revival</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting that evening "for members and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their friends;" but I turned our gang loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the town to do a little word-of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth advertisement, and, having sat idle</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the train so long, they were eating their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads off for mischief. The advance an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncements of Noah's Flood probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded somthing like the news they spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Appleton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Aintree seized opportunity to mail</seg><seg type="columnLine">a letter. She said it was to her friend in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Springfield, but she wore her dark look as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she spoke, and I knew she was lying. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">postmistress wouldn't give me any informa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, so I wrote a short letter myself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meldrum Strange and registered it. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">the postmistress copied the address into her</seg><seg type="columnLine">book I got a look at the previous entry, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I expected, it bore the name of Antonio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vittori, Lakelock, California.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was perfectly satisfactory. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever quickly we might get away from Apple-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, it was a certainty that mail would reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the border of California ahead of us, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our car would be hitched on to local trains</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dandled to a dead march across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">continent. The more time Antonio Vittori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bhopal Gosh should have to mature his</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans, the more likely he would be to fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">into our trap. Mrs. Aintree had served the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose so far perfectly. It would be time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her to send another telegram a day or so</seg><seg type="columnLine">before our premature arrival on the scene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So I didn't tell her anything about our</seg><seg type="columnLine">change of schedule until after we left Apple-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton next morning, and Sam received private</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructions in the mean time. When she</seg><seg type="columnLine">did give him a telegram he kept it in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket until I gave the word to send it off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The P. O. P. was a platform for her self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esteem and no more. She cared nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the disappointment of her dupes. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own predicament disturbed her seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously, and she believed that her only port in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm was partnership with Bhopal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gosh, the man who had supplied the brains</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the beginning. She realized as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I did that the one gold plate we had with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us would be an irresistible temptation to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had the other thirty-one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bhopal Gosh probably knew Sanskrit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If so he could appreciate and probably had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her that the stolen thirty-one plates</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unintelligible without the thirty-sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond, the kgy plate. He probably told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in imaginative oriental phrases how stupen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dously important the complete set would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be; and as a matter of plain fact he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly have exaggerated. The original law</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Moses, engraved on gold, could be used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to produce a more effective world upheaval</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any scrap of paper signed at Versailles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Consider what the Mormons did, and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing. What Mahommed did. And there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Aintree had- faith in Bhopal Gosh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his adroit intellect. She trusted him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrive some means of stealing it. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">one remaining chance of wielding the world-</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence she craved was to help Bhopal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gosh and then, if necessary, blackmail him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Otherwise her folly in consenting to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the journey with us in that car would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexplicable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Money did not appeal to her much except</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a means to a definite end. The end that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she never lost sight of, was self-importance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She yearned to be looked up to--admired--</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverenced. She was willing to go through</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything, to compromise to any extent, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">condone any wickedness with specious argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, provided only that her own sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">importance should be bolstered in the end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Bhopal Gosh, who knew that side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human nature, being built of just.such stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, understood, and laughed at her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the sequel proved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, this is ex-post-facto analysis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is extremely easy to deceive yourself</seg><seg type="columnLine">when looking backward and imagine you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wise about it all from the beginning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The truth is that I had some uncommonly</seg><seg type="columnLine">discouraged moments and, for instance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we were waiting for our evening enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainment I went and interviewed the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Appleton police. I took him quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long way into confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS a hectic evening from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">start, for Darktown turned out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the hall long before we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. According to the chief of police there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been nearly a score of free-lance</seg><seg type="columnLine">agitators in the town during the past few</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks, every one of whom had left a stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing grouch behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they were ready to be preached to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They wanted to be told that heaven lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">just beyond the hill and could be reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">by revolution. We had our own men scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered about the hall before it filled, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two of them made alleged impromptu</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeches before the opening ceremony, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moses and Mrs. Aintree</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea of keeping good humor as near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface as possible; for it was a risky game</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were going to play--the sort of game that</seg><seg type="columnLine">follows better on a joke or two than on</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnity. '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our fellows had the ritual down fine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had even improved on it. It had mostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">been designed by Mrs. Aintree with a view</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the superstitious appeal, and in order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lend solemnity to her ridiculous pretensions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For instance, after a dreamy hymn, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a solemn parade around the hall in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian file, each man doing the lock-step</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hands on the shoulders of him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front; that was supposed to represent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanderings of Israelites in the wilderness</seg><seg type="columnLine">for forty years, and it might have gone right</seg><seg type="columnLine">well on this occasion if our men hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">interjected sotto voce jokes reminiscent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the A. E. F. One laugh led to another, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they drowned out the piano finally by sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the old songs that some of them had</seg><seg type="columnLine">howled in France.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So by the time Mrs. Aintree entered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pompous as a peacock with her staff around</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, they were ready for pretty nearly any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing except serious business. We had ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">trumpeters, who represented the Israelitish</seg><seg type="columnLine">heralds sounding the blast that blew down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls of Jericho. Five trumpeters stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">on each side of the door, as she entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by meek white minions and fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed at a decent distance by Brice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Allison carrying the gold plate framed up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right on a tea-tray. I came last and received</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ovation, although I did not know why</seg><seg type="columnLine">until Sam informed me afterwards that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had advertised me as the "champeen heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight long-distance African golfer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole wide world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the sound of the first blast they all got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their feet. There were five more blasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Mrs. Aintree strode up the aisle</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificently, at each of which they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to shout: "Glory Hallelujah! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">kingdom is at hand!" By the seventh blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Aintree had reached the platform and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they all sat down, throwing one leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the other to signify that the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen and that all they had to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">now was to enjoy the feasting and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was quite an obvious difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">between members and their friends. Mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers knew which leg to throw over which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for instance--a very important point. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">also knew the responses, and were all the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> more readily tickled into ribald laughter by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new ones interjected by our men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Aintree came to the front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform, and stood there holding up a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">for silence. But silence was a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming. Circumstances were against her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tattered old crimson canvas drop-cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain had not been raised to the full distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she stood exactly underneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daubed, recumbent undraped figure of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat and silly-looking Bacchus, engaged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring a stream of yellow wine out of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue cornucopia. He was leering down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. It was only a matter of seconds, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently, before the stream of wine would</seg><seg type="columnLine">splash on her head. The audience refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop laughing until somebody went be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind and raised the curtain to its full height.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the sacred number?" she de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded in ringing tones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seven!" they answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come eleven!" shouted one of our men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a roar of laughter greeted that, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did her best to ignore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh you little lucky, lovely, rollin' bones!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said someone with a bass voice like a bull's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that pretty nearly brought the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. However, she continued-- '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How many are thf* tenets of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">P. O.

About fifty men got to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. Allison whipped the plate off the tray</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stowed it in his satchel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take that precious plate out of here!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">bawled Mrs Aintree. "Take it away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their profane eyes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was half-crazy with wounded vanity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but if she had been wholly mad she couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made a worse break from her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand-point, or a better one from mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's our gole plate!

It was exactly simultaneous with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rush by our own men, who reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform first, and just about sixty seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in advance of an invasion by the Appleton</seg><seg type="columnLine">police, who kicked the locked door open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted no time on preliminaries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It's no use telling me there won't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">fights in heaven.

That crowd had had its laugh, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh had kept it good-humored. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll find it safer to take a beef-bone from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wolf-hound's jaws than to disillusion any</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarm of men, colored or otherwise. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">more they have laughed while the disillu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioning went on, the swifter and the fiercer</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reaction afterwards.

The mob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit accounts for the remainder. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">all came on the run, some of them hurling</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs at us over the heads of the men in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was one of the toughest jobs I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced, to get that gold plate and Mrs. Aintree</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of Appleton town hall without injury to</seg><seg type="columnLine">either.

He took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the stage where the flight of steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">led up from the floor, and none who saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, or who met the calculated, swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocity of his attack, could ever more won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der why he wasn't wanted in the ring that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time when they pocketed his forfeit money</seg><seg type="columnLine">and railroaded him to jail instead. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were too many of them, even for him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got an ugly slash with a razor, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to leave Mrs. Aintree to the gang's</seg><seg type="columnLine">protection and go to his aid. Since they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had drawn razors I had no compunction</seg><seg type="columnLine">about using chair-legs, and I bucked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarm, brandishing one after the style of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Samson when he slew those thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philistines with the jawbone of an ass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only no ass' jaw, nor chair-leg could break</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a black man's skull, swat you never so</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphatically. -</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surprizing part was that nobody pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gun on us.

They hired an iron shack</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the edge of town, and the talk in there</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to their heads a bit. They got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing white men off the sidewalk. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as far as it went.

There's a donkey-engine in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next lot, and we had a chain passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round the drum with a hook at the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">end made fast to a couple of four-by-fours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They came out like black bats flitting out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">-, and since then they been kind of su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perstitious about holding meetings.

You'd better caution</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. We've been cleaning up this town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of the boys might conclude to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fresh start."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our colored crew were interested in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject only at the moment--supper, natur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally. They were standing around us close</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to call attention to themselves, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no pack of hounds at a day's end could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked more wistfully anxious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brice and Allison were packing up, me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thodical men both.

Allison liked to have his spare shoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slippers at the bottom of the bag, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the things on top laid neatly, so the business</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tidying up took time. I wanted to ce^I</seg><seg type="columnLine">them out and introduce them, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to do it, when something occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put that for the moment out of mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">e THERE came a herd of colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">men from the direction of the sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion platform, mostly in overalls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurching along and laughing, obviously of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one mind--a big, hefty-looking lot, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe forty of them. They approached our</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew and began making the idiotic P. O. P.</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs. In less than a minute there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular reunion taking place, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff and myself more or less in the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Things seem to be working out to suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," said the sheriff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was looking about for Sam, he being the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who usually caught on to a notion</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickest, and had just spotted him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside of the crqwd, when Mrs. Aintree</seg><seg type="columnLine">came hurrying heavily down the car steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pushed her way toward me, shoving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkies away to right and left as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so many ninepins. She was in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her towering passions--full of what she</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined was divine fire--so wrathy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-righteousness that nothing but her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas and her own convenience had any</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight as far as she was concerned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wicked devil!" she began, marching</seg><seg type="columnLine">right up to me.

You're being well paid for it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you simply ooze self-satisfaction!

"I am simply trying to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">you before you destroy yourself with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own wickedness! You could do good if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">chose, but you choose evil. The way of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transgressor is hard, Mr. Ramsden! You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are laying up hell for yourself, and I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">save you from it if I could!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She meant every word of it, although, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding my attention she was also forward-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing an almost perfect piece of cunning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe she was obeying orders. She caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">her breath for another outburst, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came an interruption from the other end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car--behind me in the dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help! Help!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Allison's voice. I went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescue, but I'm a trifle slow at starting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff reached the steps ahead of me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung himself up by the hand-rail, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">first into the car. I brought up short be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him. The doors of compartments</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A and B were fastened together, handle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle, by a piece of stout wire twisted as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone had used pliers for the purpose. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">took time to unfasten them, for the wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too thick to cut with an ordinary clasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife, and all the while Allison kept wrench-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the door from the inside, taking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slack and making our work more diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult. However, we got both doors open at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, and Allison came stumbling out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood all over his face. Brice was lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious on the sofa, bleeding too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have ye got him?"

The fellows behind were</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to the seat, for the road-gang had</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the ridges in and every fifty or a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred yards the car would kick like a cow</seg><seg type="columnLine">pony just off grass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon shone clearly enough to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">the precipices on our left hand--sheer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gosh%rizzly things that fell away from under</seg><seg type="columnLine">us for hundreds of feet with never a yard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearance if another car should want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass; and our lights showed hair-pin curves</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead such as made the reputations of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old stage-drivers. I kept my hair on by</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembering that the sheriff would hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">use all that speed unless he knew the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimately, but the little he said was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely reassuring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's where the stage went over last</seg><seg type="columnLine">June with eleven passengers," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">once.

A few shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">through youj: radiator.

Ahead, the road curved to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left at last, and we could see it snaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, nearly milk-white, for a mile or two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There he is! See his lights? He's in</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. No, he's off again. Changed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire, I guess. Well, we've got him now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Unless he takes to the woods," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If the sucker does that we've got him</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure!" said the sheriff. "Holding a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">through these woods is quite a trick; we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have him inside fifteen minutes. Sit tight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, I'm going to step on her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT CAME pretty close to being his</seg><seg type="columnLine">last act in this world--close to being</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curtain on the four of us. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still mounting, but the grade was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so stiff and the speed indicator touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty-five, then nearly fifty as we slid into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow of tall sugar-pines that loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the road on our right hand. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neatly as the picture on a screen slips off</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gives place to another one, we swerved</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside and went headlong over a steep bank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was lots of time to think. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like riding in an aeroplane, with air that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlit valley smiling up at us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff leaned forward and switched</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the spark as the car took a sidewise tilt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mid-air, and we crashed into splintering</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree-tops. The car remained up there, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one front wheel spinning on apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever in the calm moonlight, dumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">cushions, tools and us on to a ledge below</seg><seg type="columnLine">that provided foothold for the friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. I remember I thought it an awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">shame that the trees should break our fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">at such immense cost to themselves, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow has strange thoughts sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a crisis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That was a ---- of a way we came!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the sheriff's voice from somewhere in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark beside me. "Look at where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the track--'way back there! We</seg><seg type="columnLine">coasted through the air forever, pretty near!</seg><seg type="columnLine">My foot's busted. Anybody else hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth mentioning?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm killed!" said Casey's voice. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing holding me, but I can't move!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other man didn't answer, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved about trying to find him. When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled on him he was breathing, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">lugged him and Casey to the sheriff's side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the two of us could feel them over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you couldn't make sure in the dark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How did it happen?" I asked the sheriff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-. I caught sight of it too late. You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">remember we thought he'd changed a tire?</seg><seg type="columnLine">All he'd done was fasten thick wire at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle across the track, just high enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditch us. Smart, I'll say! Suppose you</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb up and unhitch the wire before some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else comes along and gets hurt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I climbed up. The wire was of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick gage that had been used to fasten</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door-handles in the Pullman, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound three times around a tree-trunk, led</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the road, and then made fast to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock. If we had hit it straight we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have jumped or broken it, but the angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">was such that you couldn't have hit it</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight. Even going at slow speed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have turned us outward over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the cliff, and it was nothing but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed we were using that landed us among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees instead of on the rocks this side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. I let the wire down the cliff-side for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hold-fast, and clambered down to hoist</seg><seg type="columnLine">those three men one at a time to the road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sheriff came easiest; his ankle was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly sprained, but he could help with two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and the other foot. The other two</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be carried, and it took, I daresay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-an-hour. Casey said he was in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain, but felt numb all over, and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow was obviously suffering from con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "D'you suppose you'd be all right if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the three of you here?" I asked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. Going back for help? There'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be some one along in the early morning;</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll get picked up all right. Still, if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd rather-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will you be all right?" I asked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure. What's eating you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I'll go on.

I came on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">discarded shoe with a loaded revolver near</seg><seg type="columnLine">it that he had let fall in the dust when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his coat off, and saw his tail-light dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearing around a turn not three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards ahead of me. He was not going fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Either his engine was badly overheated, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">else he was sure of having killed us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">overconfident. But no matter how fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">you walk, a car going at only fifteen or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty miles an hour is going to leave you</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty nearly standing still, and I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch sight of his tail-light again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In ordinary circumstances I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">reveled in that walk, instead of cursing</seg><seg type="columnLine">every bend in the road that only showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">another bend as soon as you rounded it--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that again another bend beyond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some six or seven thousand feet above</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea-level, the air was perfect and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scenery as wild as any man could wish. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">even saw a bear lolloping across the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of me, and hove a rock at him out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer envy, because he might enjoy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitude, whereas I must hurry on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I made what I took to be Norcross' shack</seg><seg type="columnLine">well within the hour, but there was nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. I made noise enough to wake any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one a mile away, and tried to break the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door to get to the phone, but failed. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, there was a gray horse standing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed, and a spider-wheel rig that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">just about hold together as long as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse refrained from coughing. So I wrote</seg><seg type="columnLine">a note on a leaf from my note-boolc, saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the rig had been taken by a deput y-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff and would be returned next morning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drove away at a slow trot--the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nag could offer. He had only three</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaits anyhow; the second was a walk, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third was to sit down on his rump be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the shafts and think a while. So I</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him trot, five miles an hour, or maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">six.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And try how I would I could find no</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephone. ■ All the places except one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried were unoccupied.

But this I have found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> true--that when you're going forward to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> what you expect will be a crisis, all the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> circumstances that led up to it review</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> themselves whether you will or not, until</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> you are sick at heart from recognizing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> half-a-million mistakes you made and two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> or three opportunities you overlooked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After I left the Norcross shack I daresay I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> thought of thirty better ways to bring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bhopal Gosh to account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Nevertheless, strangely enough, and un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> expectedly enough, I didn't experience the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> slightest fear, until the old horse trotted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> around one last turn between sepulchral</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pines and cedars, and on my left hand, in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> clearing, loomed the house that must be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that of Bhopal Gosh, if the sheriff's de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> scription of it was correct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Then fear struck me like a cold breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were no lights visible. There seemed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to be nobody about. But I could hear an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> engine purring in the darkness by the front-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> door, and the horse threw up his head and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> neighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lake Tahoe don't give up her dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">T T OCCURRED to me to go at once and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">put that car out of commission. I might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possibly need it for pursuit, but setting off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one possible contingency against another it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seemed wisest to dish the car. So I tied my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">borrowed Rosinante to a tree, walked up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the drive, and tore out the wires leading</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the dashboard to the switch.

That</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare on the house wall had been visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the lake shore, a quarter of a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and I now saw somebody come carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a lantern from the lake toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. He was coming in a hurry--didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice that the lights had gone out until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly reached the road, still well out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol range, perhaps two hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">from where I waited.

As he knew the ground and I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">those odds were a hundred to one in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor. I elected to stay where I was for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment, between the car and the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, listening for a footfall that would give</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a hint of his whereabouts. I heard two</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds--first, the pop from the exhaust of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a motor-boat engine down by the lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore. But he hadn't had time to reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. I decided that the boat was moored,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its engine running, ready to get under</seg><seg type="columnLine">way the moment its owner should come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next sound came from the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my rig. I heard the shafts fall to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground--a smart slap as somebody hit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse--and then the click of hooves as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moses and Mrs. Aintree</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">beast started off homeward at an easy trot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was like a game of Freeze-out--funny, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd been in a mood to laugh. I had put out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of action a car that he possibly didn't want,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had demobilized myself as far as possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble pursuit went; he had discovered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">not more than two men were on his trail; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rig would have broken down under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of more than two. And he had cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off my retreat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What puzzled me most was, why he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make straight for the motor-boat. I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heavy footstpes over to my right be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind a row of trees, and he was walking as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he weighed a ton, breaking twigs and crash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through the undergrowth like an ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phant at feeding-time. I elected not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk into that trap. Time was all in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">favor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IF I had been sure that he hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">another car waiting at the rear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house I would have headed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat at once and put that out of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission; but it was possible he was calcu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating on my doing just that, and did have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a car in reserve; so I waited, not so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoning really as acting from intuition and</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit developed in hunting days. - It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that refusal to come out in the open and be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen that forced his hand. He had to try to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmask my batteries somehow, and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rather silly way of doing it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to scream like a beast in agony,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pausing to wait for a reply and then scream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing louder. As that had no result he yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in English that he was caught by the leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a bear-trap. If it was true I was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear it; he might stay in the trap. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly not going to be such a fool as to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">and investigate; and what was more, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done me the favor of demonstrating that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all alone, for obviously any one within</seg><seg type="columnLine">hail would have gone to his assistance; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody did go. He left off yelling after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes, as a man at all prone to yelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hardly do with his leg caught in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron jaws of a bear-trap. Those things hurt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Continuing to puzzle away at the prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem I decided that he had gone down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor-boat to get the engine started, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had then come back to the house for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure. Perhaps there had been some</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt in his mind whether he could start</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine, and he had preferred to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure before committing himself to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of escape. If those heavy gold plates</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were in the house yet it was hardly likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">that both he and they would escape me</seg><seg type="columnLine">before morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he had grown suspiciously quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and I listened intently, wishing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact with cities and railroads hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulled my hunting ear. I could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor-boat popping away steadily, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">one sound from Bhopal Gosh. The lantern,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying gently on its twig, still burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly where he had left it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His next move took me utterly by sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. The porch light was switched on sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly from inside the house, and I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed between the door and the car at</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointblank pistol range. I ducked around</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the car, astonished that I wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired at; and, from that. position, peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the top, I caught sight of his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking through a window to the right of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front door. I pulled the wrong pistol from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pocket--his that I had picked up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road beside the abandoned tire--took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap shot at him, and missed. But he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot back. It dawned on me that I had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">only firearm! True to Terence Casey's dic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tum, the arch-crook had overlooked one</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple, necessary point!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That settled it. I smashed in the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow with the pistol-butt, and scrambled in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting my hand, but as luck would have it</seg><seg type="columnLine">not badly enough to make it useless. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door at the end of that room slammed in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, and I heard the key turn on the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, but I took a heavy chair and swung it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ax-fashion, breaking the door down in less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a minute. That let me through into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall. He had switched the light off, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doing something in a devil of a hurry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I could hear his heavy breathing not far</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. Then I caught the metallic hum of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe opening, and the rattle of the handle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner, sheet-iron door as he fumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it in the dark. By the sound I judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was at the end of the hall, so I fired the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same pistol I had used before to try and</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch sight of him by the flash--or hit him</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I happened to be lucky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What I did see was the wall-button that</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled the electric current. I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">another door slam, and by the time I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched the light on Bhopal Gosh was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone; but he had not removed the plunder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although he did get away with the key to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner door of the safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The safe stood under the main stairway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was an inexpensive affair with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">6o</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">combination lock on the outer door, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had left unfastened in his hurry. I dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">say I could have forced that inner door with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out much trouble if given time, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed wiser in the circumstances to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the treasure in there and return when I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckoned with the man. He wasn't likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be doing nothing while I fooled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So I went back for another chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed the door on the right-hand side 01</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safe that he had disappeared through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a good, heavy office chair with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron revolving screw in it and iron-braced</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, so the door went down in short order;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at that I wasn't in time. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cellar below-stairs piled high with old, dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord-wood, and ms the door crashed out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward a stinging cloud of white smoke met</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with the crackling of blazing bark and</seg><seg type="columnLine">splinters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I charged through, with the idea of catch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him before he could' take advantage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoke to give me the slip altogether.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was holding his pistol in my right hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having shoved it in my hip pocket while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">used the chair for a battering-ram, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">two pistols in one pocket, and as I rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through I grabbed the first one that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers closed on. Bhopal Gosh was waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me just inside the door, and seized me</seg><seg type="columnLine">by both arms from behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      IT NEEDED no expert in intuition</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vtg- to guess what his game was then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">------ He meant to hurl me down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blaze below, and return for the contents of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safe. And it was a new experience to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover myself almost helpless in the arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a stronger man. All up and down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world I have only met three amateurs who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could beat me with their fists or on the mat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they had to work for their laurels. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fellow twisted the revolver out of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand with the ease of a gorilla, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung it down the cellar stairs into the gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loping holocaust below us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yah-ah-ah!" he laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was an expensive little joke, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he let go my right hand to hurl the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon away I swung sharp round to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and crashed my fist into his mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting it a second time on his magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth, but giving him far the worst of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exchange. However, he had me by the wrist</seg><seg type="columnLine">again before I could reach for my own re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver, and luckily--so swift he was1--before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he even guessed that that was my intention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heat was already terrific. Once or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice when a draft caught them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames licked over the top of the cellar</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs, and he started to force me backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward that hell, grinning in my face ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">levolently as he stepped forward like a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat dancing-master--only it was muscle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him bulk so big. It was the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ever felt really helpless in the grasp of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger man,\tnd after the first strain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned me of his enormous power I wasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more energy on trying that issue with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I relaxed my muscles suddenly. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that roared behind me I could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumphant malice in his face; but he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no hurry; he was enjoying the foretaste of</seg><seg type="columnLine">victory--grinning like a great ape. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see how he had been so easily mistaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Italian by men who were not suspicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an alias, yet his face grew more Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">golian as you examined it. And he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">care that I should examine it, thrusting it</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to mine in order to peer into my eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You feel the fire behind?" he sneered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The brute wasn't even out of breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are going down into it backwards!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we will wait just a minute or two and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flames take hold, because there is a door</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading from that cellar to the garden, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you seem to have a gift for breaking doors!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thrust his great, dark face still closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to mine, so that his enormous shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose higher than his neck. I guessed him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty inches around the chest, with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">other detail in proportion, but he may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been bigger than that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am curious about you!" he went on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You are not of the police. Are you^one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those poor fools who discovered a treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they could not keep? You are too un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise for Providence--I suppose you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">call it Providence?--to leave it in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands! You would not know how to use it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do. I shall use it! I shall leave you</seg><seg type="columnLine">roasting here, and take it away with me!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're not talkative! It's your last chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk, you know, until you come into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world reincarnated as a beetle or a rat!</seg><seg type="columnLine">You don't like the prospect of being burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to death? It terrifies you? Too bad! You</seg><seg type="columnLine">would prefer the butt of Malmsey wine</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected by the Duke of Clarence?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even the least astute of us become one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse philosophers as we grow older. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">any man starts boasting in my face I take</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moses and Mrs. Aintree</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">courage. Boasting is the inevitable prelude</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disaster., I'm convinced of that, and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ounce of conviction is worth a ton of any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body's argument. I knew that minute that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might hurl me down into the fire, but if</seg><seg type="columnLine">so he was coming with me, and I guessed I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could face those flames as well as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maybe he read the determination in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. He started there and then to force</seg><seg type="columnLine">me backward, and I tried to throw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a trick of the heel. He saved him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self from that, but lost his balance and I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">my left fist free, gaining a good two yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the flames and sending my left</seg><seg type="columnLine">home three times, once into his wind, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice into the region of his jaw. He had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let go my right wrist to protect himself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got my right home into his left eye before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, gripping like a bear, he began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">force me backward once more, lifting me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as my ribs cracked under his pressure. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had me under the arms, which left both</seg><seg type="columnLine">fists free, and I rained blows on his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eyes that would have taken some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight out of a Spanish bull. I guess I blinded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for the moment. I could feel the sicken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing scorch of the flames behind me as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor-beams and door-posts caught; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I caught him by the neck and swung clear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if I hadn't been in too much of a hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would have gone down into the cellar</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of me, for I drove for the region of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ear with my right fist, and the blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">went wild.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I thought of my own revolver in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hip-pocket, and he thought of all out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors. The smoke and flame were blinding;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of my jacket was smoldering, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think his coat was too. At any rate, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes half-shut, and with the floor-beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to crack under our combined</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight, he lowered his head and charged me</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a bull. Instead of meeting him with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee, as I should have done, I stepped aside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a shot at him, and missed! Missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at fifteen inches! So much for smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> SWE 1 BOTH went out of the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">like rabbits running from a grass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, he straight by way of that nod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding lantern for the motor-boat, and I after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, with the flames behind us lighting up</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the windows now as they caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">draft from the open front door. It was only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of seconds before the whole house</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a raging furnace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was out of breath, for he had crushed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribs in badly, and on top of that I had swal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed a lungful of acrid smoke. What was</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse, I am built rather for heavy work than</seg><seg type="columnLine">running races; and for a man of his prodig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious weight and strength he was fleet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">footed. But he ran with his hands to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. I had done him harm enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">equalize the odds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moreover, he wasted energy. His short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est course to the motor-boat was not by</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of the lantern. In order to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern en route he had to cover two sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a broad-based triangle, giving him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least an extra hundred yards to run. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did that, and I took the shorter route to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut him off, wondering what strange frenzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed him and supposing that his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be so badly hurt that he was running</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-blindly for whatever he could see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet he didn't pick up the lantern. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused there for half-a-second, tugging at</seg><seg type="columnLine">something else that shook the lantern to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground as it came loose from the tree, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried whatever it was away with him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still in the lead by a dozen yards, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried a shot as I ran, with no result except</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently to increase his speed; and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course I had to slow down for a second in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to take aim, which gave him a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">more yards of advantage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had now four shots left, and no spare</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridges. On the other hand, in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pace, I was beginning to feel better as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smoke got pumped out of my lungs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, the fire by now was enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm the countryside; they would turn out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save the forest trees if nothing else, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was likely I would have help any minute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet he was gaining on me--careering like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hippopotamus for his own element, cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing an ell to my yard as he crashed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over everything. I never saw any man</seg><seg type="columnLine">take such enormous strides as he did, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the way with his hands before his face, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I had done his eyes real damage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was easily fifty yards ahead when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the water's edge and hesitated be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore jumping to the beach below. ' In that</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertain moonlight, and with my hand no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt trembling from the run, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a fool's chance to take another shot;</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet I took it--stopped dead, aimed care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, and fired. I hit him. He dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that was hanging from his arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">clapped his hand to his side, and toppled</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidewise over the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did that last fifty yards in record time--</seg><seg type="columnLine">my record at all events. I figured on jump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on him from the top of the bank and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finishing the business. But when I reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank he was clambering off a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">plank pier into the boat and snatching</seg><seg type="columnLine">feverishly at the lines to cast loose. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the boat fast in two places, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my favor, but he got both lines free and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instant he had thrown the clutch into</seg><seg type="columnLine">gear and opened up the gas he crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the boat's side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remembered then that there is such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing under heaven as horse sense. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have easily wasted my three remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots in an effort to plug him, but the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a considerably larger target. I fired all</seg><seg type="columnLine">three deliberately, plunk into the boat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them damaged the engine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It doesn't take much to stop one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">single-cylinder affairs. I hadn't done much</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm to the engine, for he got it going again</seg><seg type="columnLine">in less than a minute; but during that min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute the water must have made headway</seg><seg type="columnLine">through two bullet-holes, and by the time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to pay attention to it the water was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swishing all' over the bottom. What with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the state of his eyes and the darkness he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't find the trouble. For a minute or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two after that he seemed to be lifting off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat-covers and looking for a pump, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was none, for he began bailing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small tin can. Then the engine gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">final cough and quit for good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I lit a cigar. I'm willing to take oath</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if there had been a boat within reach I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have put off and tried to save him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the hangman. But there wasn't any</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. I daresay he had taken care there</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldn't be. And as for swimming--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might swim in that nearly ice-cold water if</seg><seg type="columnLine">so minded; I tested it with my hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that I for one couldn't stay afloat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for two minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of my bullets must have done much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than bore a hole in the hull, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have bailed against two. or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">against three bullet-holes. But though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked like fury the water gained on him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I could see the hull submerging inch by</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lost his courage in the end completely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chill of that rising water around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs gave him too definite a foretaste of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was coming. He began to scream for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">help and to call on some Deity I never heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of. I tore two planks off the pier and hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as far as I could out into the lake, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was a quarter of a mile away, and I doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if he saw me throw them. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have reached them anyhow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went down screaming, and the cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm water closed over him with a ring of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripples that danced in the moonlight until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last, ever-widening circle nearly reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shore. Then I turned to examine what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever it was that he had dropped when my</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet touched him, and clambering up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank discovered nothing less than Allison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather satchel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YOU'LL be right if you- suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I unbuckled the flap with</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling fingers. Maybe I shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">---I don't know--when I discovered the gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate safe inside. But it was badly dam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged. My bullet had struck it near one</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner, ploughed through the soft gold for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several inches, itself expanding as it went,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally had gone clear through to expand</seg><seg type="columnLine">its last momentum on the ribs of Bhopal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gosh. The plate had been further damaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he dropped it, for it was bent out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape, and I think he must have stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it, because a good deal of the scripture</seg><seg type="columnLine">was obliterated. Nevertheless, it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate, and I had at least something to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to poor old Allison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no more chance of recovering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other plates than of gleaning snow on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plains in midsummer. We had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer safe-door open, and the whole house</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a roaring furnace. It might be possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the ashes should cool off, to recover a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapeless mass of nearly pure gold; but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far more likely that the safe had tilted</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward as the beams gave way underneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and the stuff as it melted had run out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">got lost so thoroughly that its recovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cost more than the game was worth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to get some of the fellows who</seg><seg type="columnLine">came racing to the fire to help find a boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and look for Bhopal Gosh, but when I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them sufficient of the circumstances they</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at the idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never dragged a corpse out o' that lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, unless in the shallows inshore.

They were holding him for ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">som.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Money? Why, my good fellow, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">am I to get it?

Also explain that unless I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">released forthwith I shall see that these</seg><seg type="columnLine">people are punished, severely punished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I cannot imagine how-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does he say?" sharply queried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kassui. "Is it a spell?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No spell, Great One, but he cannot pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce the tokens," answered the Vohlu man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you send to Nakitalo, he says you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be given tokens in handfuls for his release,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he is needed by his people.

Fear, icy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingered, clutched at his throat and he tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bluster and bully while Kassui gnawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his beard and watched him with blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has no magic," miserably repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Vohlu man. "May I be spared, O</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great One?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For answer the chief raised his'left hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a half-dozen spears struck down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking captive as the warriors closed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the kill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Conroy, for all his vast experience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never seen death, violent death at such</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">close quarters. Street accidents he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">and understood, for he had seen an old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked down and killed by an automobile</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the busiest district of Sydney; but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not face this ghastly horror. With dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended eyes and drooping jaw he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">a warrior chop off the fallen man's head with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one blow of a bamboo knife, saw them pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the body and bear it away, heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamor of the other captives and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainted dead away for the second time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus he mercifully missed the great feast</seg><seg type="columnLine">which took place that night when the Tiuka</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremonially ate their victims to acquire</seg><seg type="columnLine">their soul substance and afterward danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sound of the drums, stopping fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently that each man might recount his</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeds of bravery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^THE ensuing days, however, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came one long nightmare. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner had been spared for a fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture sacrifice and through him Conroy dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered how and when he was to die. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">surviving captive had a gift for graphic</seg><seg type="columnLine">description, and Conroy was tortured by</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions of his own bleaching skull adorning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new hut. He vividly pictured the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">rite when he would be led out to his death</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by frenzied tribesmen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To his surprize he was not harshly</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated. True, he was kept under guard but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tiukas, even Kassui, provided him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and conversed with him through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vohlu man. When he spoke of his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">power in his distant home they grinned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man of Vohlu, at once resigned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">contented, worked in the fields with his cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors and took up a definite place in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">social system. He was given a wife and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut of his own and lived apparently, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best of terms with his neighbors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His days were long before him, he told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conroy, for his soul would only be needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the taro season came around. Mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he was happy. He had food and shel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter and a woman. Death came to all men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to each his appointed hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conroy merely shuddered and glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearfully at the hut which his soul was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard. The whole tribe worked spasmodic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally at its construction. For days it stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">untouched, then a score of men would work</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it, singing lustily while they lashed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounded and chopped. Conroy grew de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed and frightened. The remnants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pajamas and his slippers had long since</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished and he went about clad in a strip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bark cloth, which a native woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughingly, had thrown to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gone was his mission and his love for</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive people, gone his desire to help and</seg><seg type="columnLine">improve them. In his mind he evolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">drastic disciplinary systems to curb and</seg><seg type="columnLine">check their barbarous ways. The sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bullet were mild when compared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the methods he would advocate. Above</seg><seg type="columnLine">all things his soul revolted at their lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleanliness and decency. Once he wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed an initiation ceremony which left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him gasping in horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the crossbeams were put in place</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the fateful house he tried to escape, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be caught as he stumbled heavily in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness between the huts. He incurred no</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishment for this offence except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kassui spat at him and the women laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to scorn. At last, however, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">singing Workers began to thatch the hut and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women were collecting fruit and food</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the coming feast, Conroy roused himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his dejected torpor. He would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed like a scared rabbit, he told himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would make one last dash for freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't die like this," he repeated again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again as he lay in the dark and listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the heavy breathing of his jailer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late at night he became hysterical and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbed in great gulps. The native stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">restlessly in his sleep, and Conroy trembling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged toward the dimly outlined doorway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His groping hand found the Tiuka's club</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his fingers closed around the smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Crouching on his knees he raised the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon above his head. But he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">control over his muscles now. His arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to act. He was shaking with terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't do it," he whimpered. "I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it. Oh, God, the last of my manhood has</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. The very last of my manhood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tears streamed down his dirty cheeks as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked at the dark body barring his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still murmuring, "The last of my man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood," he suddenly stiffened and brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the club down on the sleeper's head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow he crept out of the village and</seg><seg type="columnLine">up through the bush. As the dawn broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reached the crest and paused for breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was torn and bleeding and still sobbed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lashed the low bushes about him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood-stained club.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Naked Truth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Away below him he heard faint cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">which reached him softened and mellowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the still morning air. The man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunt had begun. The clamor increased in</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume. He caught sight of a dark body</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping from rock to rock. They were after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him already.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And ahead lay the sea, placid and blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still. He stumbled forward and began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to toil down the hillside, falling and rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the rocks, crying aloud for help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">McLAIRD sat with his feet cocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on the window-sill reading a</seg><seg type="columnLine">month-old copy of the Sydney</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bulletin. The cigaret between his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed at regular intervals and unhurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffs of blue smoke emerged from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils, curling slowly up into the hot, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him at the table sat two heated</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen in faultless white clothes who</seg><seg type="columnLine">glared at the back of his bald head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidgeted uncomfortably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is ridiculous!" one of them declared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Shelburn and I demand your atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

"You cannot refuse to answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">our questions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ' Well," drawled McLaird, "it's this</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. You two have been here for a week</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling me about Conroy and how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">money you lose if he dies. I've been think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about him, too, and what an almighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">beating up he'll get if I ever meet him."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now, now," admonished Mr. Shelburn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No threats, please. The whole affair looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad enough as it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you've said a good many times,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out McLaird. " Conroy disappears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm found with a dislocated collar-bone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bruised head, so I must have murdered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. That's the idea, isn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm no lawyer," answered Mr. Shelburn,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"but on the face of it-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rot," snapped McLaird. "You're as</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy as that nut Conroy. Just hang about</seg><seg type="columnLine">here for a few hours until the gendarme</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns up and he will give you all the latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">news. This business pleases him an awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot, I should imagine; having to run around</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a wild Australian when he could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing nice reports or nursing his goats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">D'you know, he lets a whole bunch of 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">stray into my fattening paddocks! Graft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's what it is. But he's not a bad lad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Thorpe helped himself to warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy and set the bottle down on the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a crash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not concerned with your absurd</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubles," he exclaimed angrily.

Now leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me alone until the gendarme gets here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But--" began Mr. Shelburn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLaird turned and leveled his discon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certing blue eyes at the speaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep quiet," he ordered, and Mr. Shel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn sat back limply with a dismayed look</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gendarme arrived in the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the afternoon, tired and disgusted, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had some information.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been up to the most remote Vohlu</seg><seg type="columnLine">village, which he had found burnt to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. He had not been told about it</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier because the tribesmen wanted to hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at their enemies. The attackers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">little-known people living beyond the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipitous slopes of Mount Ndoki. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">captured Conroy and taken him away alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so a survivor had told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This man should be put in prison if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">still lives," grumbled the officer.

Sweating, panting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and infuriated he reached level ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung into the saddle after his horse had</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced and circled around for several min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes. In his exasperation he did a very rash</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing--he used both his long, nickel-plated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily roweled spurs, and his horse bolted</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlong at right angles to the party, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders and bushes in his sudden mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By some miraculous intervention which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had nothing to do with good horsemanship</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thorpe kept his seat and his wild cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached McLaird just before he was carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight behind a high clump of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes. The party wheeled and followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as best they could while Shelburn, closing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cavalcade at a dignified trot, kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">crying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop him!

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to lie flat on the ground and sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rest. So they bound and trussed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and foot, offered a prayer to the spirits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the giant pine for having arrested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captive's flight, and Squatted down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade for a while before bearing such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight back across the hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not finish him here?" suggested a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young warrior who had only killed his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the raid on the Vohlus and had but</seg><seg type="columnLine">scant respect for traditions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kah!

So then he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on up the road and passed a cross-roads</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the signs said Brownsville and Dragon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fly and Home Run, they being the names</seg><seg type="columnLine">of regimental or battalion headquarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were in that direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The observer looked off at the German</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines that were across the river and won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered whether any one was watching him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thought that the sunset was gorgeous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the valley of the Marne was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most beautiful place that he had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. He went on down a road bordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by elms, ancient and immemorial, down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little town where every house had blanket-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed windows, and after following a line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows went down into a cellar and reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the officer that he found there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This one turned him over to a sergeant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who led him by a nice trench back of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses and through some gardens to a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">just under the railroad track, where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found some seven men, hatless, and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his face blackened and a look of dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet upon it, like a child seeing the castor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil appear, or a man on horseback who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not quite sure of his seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose," said the observer, seeing no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of any shoulder-bars, "that the officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">is still eating his supper.

Now we will cross in a boat which</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been provided and go straightway up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank in single file. I will be in the lead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each man shall hold the ankle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in front of him. As we crawl along,</seg><seg type="columnLine">should I kick twice, the signal will be passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the line, and we will all execute right</seg><seg type="columnLine">into line, each man with his bombs in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and when I say, 'Now!' then let each</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush forward.

This is once when the artillery will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not shoot up its own troops."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When it was dark the patrol crept over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railroad track and down through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheat to the river's edge. It was damp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold, and the observer was stricken with</seg><seg type="columnLine">chills, and his teeth chattered, and his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook like a leaf. When they were getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the boat, he nearly capsized it, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he done so, they were all dead, for the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank was German and was but ten feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They lay under the shelter of the bank for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time, and then up and across a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">path into the wheat, the artillery man</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging for his life to a thick ankle. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ankle belonged to a large, rough man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by name "Gopher," a Tar Heel, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good man to cling to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they went on, and ever and anon</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to listen, and loud was the pounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their hearts. The wind whistled through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wheat, and the observer wondered how</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would ever get back across the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the tears ran down the bridge of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose and tickled it so that he was hard put</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep from sneezing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now some one with few brains and much</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity found a rocket on the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and touched it off, to see what would</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen. At once every man with a Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistol discharged it so that the bank on</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sides of the river was as bright as day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The patrol lay without breathing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing inwardly, for they knew that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have worked either east or west and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in front of troops that had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned that there was a patrol out, and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">7 6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that the lights were almost over</seg><seg type="columnLine">them they knew they were not far from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank for all their crawling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moreover, the Americans were having a</seg><seg type="columnLine">merry time with their machine-guns, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">although the bullets were all going high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still it was not pleasant to hear the pounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see the wheat falling and dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">around one's ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came like a thunderbolt. Gopher</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked the observer suddenly in the face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he rushed forward without further</seg><seg type="columnLine">parley, falling headlong into a shell-hole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a startled grunt, and he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one running off trailing a blanket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Out pistol and a bullet away to the moon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lieutenant kicking him vigorously and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing him to a fare-you-well, and a free</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight going on under his nose. The light</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out, and darkness came that you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste. Much straining and cursing, then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thud, and silence. Two husky whispers</seg><seg type="columnLine">proclaimed--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ' I've got one of the illegitimates."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Startled mutterings, and--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, I thought you was one of them,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">from two throats at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hot dog!" said a voice.

There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">artillery fire and few lights, which meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the enemy had out patrols looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and their hearts sank in consequence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was growing colder as the night ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced, and the way back to the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed overlong.

The pound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of his heart shook him like a leaf.

While he debated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with himself he heard a stealthy creeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the path, and when he was like to die</seg><seg type="columnLine">from fear and horror he heard words and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once knew that the creepers were Americans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they were both cursing a third to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart's content.

Half a dozen workmen straggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">leisurely over to the crossover and hoisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dump-car back upon the rails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now give this feller a load," directed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the foreman angrily.

The stout collar</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained against his broad chest as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed his neck and tugged obediently at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burden. The heavy load of rock began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move along the rails with gradually in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing speed. The rails led directly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the crest of the advancing wall of crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock that was being thrown across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighboring valley. This crest was called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "dump." The terminating rails pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected a few inches beyond the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dump and across their ends was bolted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of heavy timber called the "bumper."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The modus opercmdi was as follows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A dump-car was driven at a moderate</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of speed to within a few yards of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">bumper. The horse would then be pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply about, automatically unhooking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiffletree chain from the car. The car</seg><seg type="columnLine">would then proceed at its own momentum</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it struck the bumper, the force of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such impact operating the mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dumped the load. The horse would</seg><seg type="columnLine">then be rehooked to the dumped car and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the process repeated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dynamite was quite familiar with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">details of this operation--much more so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact, than was his driver. Whether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful black had it in mind to show off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his capabilities before his new attendant or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether his act was inspired by a pure love</seg><seg type="columnLine">of deviltry, was a matter of individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion. At any rate, notwithstanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kingdon's desperate attempts at control,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horse assumed complete charge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceedings. He pulled the heavily loaded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">car toward the dump at full speed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismayed New Yorker could hear the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's voice filling the air with shouts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">curses behind him, but all the power of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms could not swerve Dynamite from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-willed course. Ten yards from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dump the horse turned sharply about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhooked himself with practised ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The speeding car struck hard against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bumper and instantly dumped its contents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, with its momentum still urging it on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it turned completely over the obstacle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed down the side of the hill of rock in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of somersaults until it landed bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the valley a hundred feet below.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kingdon stood holding the reins with pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sied hands until Dynamite, scenting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver's confusion and helplessness, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage of the situation by galloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to freedom. The whiffletree, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to the traces, caught against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stump and snapped in twain as the powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast crashed his way through the forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kingdon's ruin was complete. The gang</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rock cut came running excitedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to the dump. Curses and epithets</seg><seg type="columnLine">popped from the foreman's mouth like</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparks from an anvil. The New Yorker's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face paled and his hands clenched as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced the foreman's opprobrious attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even a worm will do it," he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-y'u!

So to-day</seg><seg type="columnLine">I watched him, quizzed him, frankly both-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered him about you and became convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Fran was right. The man actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped when I told him that I expected you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call this evening, and he at once left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonny for an unknown destination."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Charteris laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That wasn't quite fair. What, might I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask, did Parker say when Agwala accused</seg><seg type="columnLine">me of throwing a monkey wrench into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">law's machinery."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, he just told him he was talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbish, or something to that effect.

So I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I see," quietly and flipping his cigaret</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the open door. "Frankly, I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect to see you occupying that corner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I appreciate the honor keenly. Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trusted confidant of yours?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Catherine's heightened color was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptible this time. She glanced quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the knife in her lap, gingerly fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered the edge of it, then put it aside with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an involuntary shudder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've known Andy for years.

"Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause, of course, there is really nothing I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Catherine stared. Her cheeks flamed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She felt like a very little girl who was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent home because her conduct had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">good. Her eyes lighted up angrily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not a child!" she began, not at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of the impulsiveness of her speech.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And I didn't go to all the bother of induc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Andy Graham to bring me up here sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply to go away again without coming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of understanding about your po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition in this terrible affair. Malkett, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police, agrees with Mr. Parker that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agwala was talking nonsense.

The stillness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped the place had a smothering effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a queer hint of stifled laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air. She loitered a few steps nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish you would be frank with me,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said simply, as though his veiled threats</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not worthy of any consideration.

I had another cable from</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother this morning, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does Miss Goddard think about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fran? Oh, she--" Catherine stopped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why is that important? You know per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly well you irritate her simply because</seg><seg type="columnLine">she can't hurt you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charteris glanced along the veranda to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the shadowy outline of Andy Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wrapped in a furious cloud of pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke. Then he moved out of the doorway</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room again, giving Catherine an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to run if she wanted to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You forgot the knife.

The way to the door was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, and he gave her permission to possess</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself of the ugly Hausa dagger to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that the way remained clear. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">color drifted and her mouth became a severe</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. There was something of Hugh Morri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son in her face then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She walked suddenly toward Charteris</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was not the slightest sign of fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her eyes. When she halted he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched her with his outstretched hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've come up here because I believed--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still believe--that you really know more</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the inner workings of native intrigue</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Malkett and MacGregor and Parker</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all the rest of them put together."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thank you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I thought you would be man enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help a white woman when she needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">help very badly.

She gasped, drew back</seg><seg type="columnLine">a step, stopped because she had to--but did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not scream. Charteris knew she was trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling, but her eyes did not show it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of Andy Graham coughing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no effect upon the situation except to relieve</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outer darkness a trifle. A moment later</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was blacker and more silent than ever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catherine asked with just the suggestion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sneer--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is my cue to yell, I suppose?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not unless you want to.

This is just cheap dramatics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or more trifling. Please let me go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charteris' shoulders ceased to lean</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall. He drew her a little nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know, there's a whole lot to be said</seg><seg type="columnLine">in favor of taking advantage of one's oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunities.

You aren't even restless!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Catherine tried to draw away from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Rubbish!" she exclaimed disparagingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but her voice sounded weak and uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vincing. "This is all bosh! Please let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">go. Don't!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charteris' hands had reached-her shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders in a twinkling and she found, in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, that she was being held very</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly in his arms, his face a scant few</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches above her own. Yet she did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream. She was, in -point of fact, afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ashamed to admit to Andy Graham</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her secret adventure had been a mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're hurting me," she said quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying with all her might not to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened while she shrank from the queer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold laughing blue of his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry," softly. "But I understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that even the nicest ladies like to be knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a bit. In fact, I think they prefer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be carted off bodily."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His left hand curled about her neck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped over her mouth without a second's</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning, stifling her involuntary cry of fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that it was nothing more than a choking</seg><seg type="columnLine">gurgle in her throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before she fully realized that it was possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble that such a thing could happen to her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charteris was half way down the rickety</seg><seg type="columnLine">galley stairs and she was being "carted off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bodily" as if she were no more trouble than</seg><seg type="columnLine">an infant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The arms that held her captive were sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strong and without mercy. The hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was clapped across her mouth was by</seg><seg type="columnLine">no means gentle. She could not use even</seg><seg type="columnLine">her teeth to bite her voice's way to free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that the experience hurt as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">outraged, and, going down the galley stairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catherine had a moment 01 two in which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize her predicament, because it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous to struggle then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the foot, however, she leaped in Char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teris' arms like a wild thing; leaped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked and tried to tear her head out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamping grip of his left hand. The result</seg><seg type="columnLine">was simply a tightening of that grip--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushing sense of helplessness--a groping</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dark of unbelief as she gathered her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self together for another strenuous bid for</seg><seg type="columnLine">freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She could not see very well where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going, but presently she heard Char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teris say softly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is really exciting.

The.n, she struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him, but her blows fell short and broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">their strength upon his shoulder, hurting</seg><seg type="columnLine">her knuckles more than they did his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der-blade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, out of the storm, came Char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teris' voice smoothly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A perfect conclusion to a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening. What a pity it isn't real!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he suddenly stood her upon her</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, saw that she preserved her equilibrium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stood off a pace blandly watching her</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was standing on the gig-wharf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BULGE IN THE SCREEN</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T TOLD you there was a back door,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charteris said pleasantly. Then after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short and heavy pause. "Shall I call</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham, or would you prefer to make your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own explanations?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Catherine leaned against the wharf rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Gray Charteris</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in absolute silence. Her mouth hurt, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath came hardly and she was trembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the grip of a reaction that was almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrifying as the imprisonment of Charteris's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Speech was beyond her, but she felt so</seg><seg type="columnLine">inconsequent and so utterly foolish that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing at all mattered very much. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charteris laughed at her, perhaps she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have liked it better. But he was so irritat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly pleasant and sympathetic that even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incessant hum of mosquitoes about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears did not disturb her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked down into the Bonny's launch</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was tied up to the wharf, smothered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a somewhat hysterical sob of anger that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mixed with an odd kind of disappoint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, then, with a tremendous effort, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching body straightened and she said in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a voice that, though it hesitated a little for</seg><seg type="columnLine">want of breath, was almost normal--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose that was your way of proving</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me that it isn't wise to be too sure of any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing or any one?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps. But I'll admit you were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent burden. Elsie--that's your sister's</seg><seg type="columnLine">name, isn't it?--would be lighter and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">tractable than you, I imagine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Catherine swallowed once or twice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then decided to ignore his reference to Elsie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was also your way of saying definitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you won't take sides with me?

What shall I say to him?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nothing. I'll tell my own lies."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charteris excused himself politely, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked up the path leaving her to her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">somber reflections.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her mouth and her throat were dry and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a moment or two, whether she would or</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, angry tears sprang into her eyes. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">jabbed at them with a handkerchief,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched her hands and bit upon her already</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching Ups with astonishing intensity for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman of her accustomed poise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not often that Catherine Morrison</seg><seg type="columnLine">had occasion to feel cheap and, in these few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, she did not bless the impulse that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had encouraged her to trifle so carelessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with edged tools. Her anger, however, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not directed against Charteris. Repeatedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without stint, shrinking from the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows of canoes that whispered and crooned</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they passed her by, she called herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night that had wrapped her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cloak on the way up, was now pitted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that peered and laughed. Not because</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had come there and had been ridiculed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her pains, but because she was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">away again so unimportantly and so pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully little desired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore Catherine writhed and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued to denounce herself as an impression-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able idiot, who was so mentally unbalanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to become maudlinly sentimental over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who was little better than a tramp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Charteris appeared again, chat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting most unconcernedly with Andy Gra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ham who was obviously suspicious of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hausa dagger Charteris carried so openly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You forgot this," Charteris said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catherine, bending over to put the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully into her grasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh--thanks," she acknowledged weakly</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she realized what it was.

It sounded so small and weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charteris, however, did not stop to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. He hurried to the bush at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the beach. Passing the galley</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs, he whispered to Ogulo the dwarf to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go up and blow out the lamp, then went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to join Abado who was fuming impatiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the entrance to the narrow bush path</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led to the village of Dowadda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wha's matter?" the Sobo complained in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a disgruntled voice.

And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his rage against Agwala had roused him</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely from his suicidal lethargy, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beginning to think for himself and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger for action of his own devising.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As in the case of the murder of Morrison,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that action would be subtle only in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soundlessness of its execution; simply a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question of striking swiftly in the dark be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore his enemy had any opportunity to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">likewise to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, in truth, Abado was frankly out for</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood.

His arms were strapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him with his service belt, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ankles were bound with the belt that ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">narily supported his trousers. He was dirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disheveled and his head ached from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of the quieting crack Charteris had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him with the butt of the revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His morale, therefore, was at a very low</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebb.

A moment's pause. "Garland--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's my shop clerk--saw ye goin' up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grandison's beach the night.

His trade is wanderin' about</seg><seg type="columnLine">--here, there and everywhere--and we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not gettin' the half of it. Even Jardine, over</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, has done nearly as much business as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have in the past two 'r three days!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Catherine regarded Hogmanay's unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">indignation with a slight smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't mind that very much, do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mind!

I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a servant. You will be something he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never expected to happen. And I'll warrant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we land in on him at this hour, he'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whole lot more afraid o' you than you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be of him. Are ye sure ye want to go, now?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course!

I told him what Agwala said</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the shielding of Abado, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed at me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Um--well, ye shouldn't have told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that," MacGregor said cannily, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back beach watch boy solemnly struck six</seg><seg type="columnLine">bells on the old ship's bell that hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the oil yard fence. "But it's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. He probably knew it already.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That watch boy's a bit slow. It's nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve than eleven. Just a minute till I</seg><seg type="columnLine">call Garland."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is he coming, too?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye.

He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a handy man to have about ye in a native</seg><seg type="columnLine">village."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gracious! That sounds exciting!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No---just a bit o' caution in the matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">where to put yodr feet," Hogmanay said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">halting a moment in the doorway. "Native</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages are not overparticular under foot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ye wouldn't be fit to live with if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were laid up with a sprained ankle now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catherine laughed. She was tingling all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over in the hope that the visit to Agwala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">town was not going to be as mild as Hog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manav promised. MacGregor went along</seg><seg type="columnLine">102</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to Garland's room praying that he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a mistake in taking her there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garland was waiting for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," the shop clerk announced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm full of artillery. Can you see any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hogmanay looked him over critically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a suspicious looking lump under</seg><seg type="columnLine">your left arm. Pull it for'ard a bit and it'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garland's hand disappeared under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt and pulled the "lump" forward a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine," Hogmanay approved. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm hopin' we don't have to murder any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. Come along and take Miss Morrison</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the launch while I get ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another minute Hogmanay was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaining to Catherine that he had one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two little things to attend to and that if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go to the launch and advise Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham where they were going, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">join her in a jiffy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Catherine accepted Garland's escort with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smile that put him immediately at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease. The moment they were gone, Hog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manay promptly retrieved the revolvers</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He loaded them carefully, and, like Gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, slung one under each armpit inside his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt. It was a trick he had learned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a poetic gentleman, known from Sierra</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leone to Duke Town, Calabar, by the vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent pseudonym of "Knife-Edge" Harring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton; the gentleman, by the way, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for the aforementioned last</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand of Chief Motu of Segwanga.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hogmanay recalled the affair and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man with a reminiscent grin, then, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that there was nothing but the measure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his own speed to hinder the "draw", he</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly gave instructions to a sleepy</seg><seg type="columnLine">steward not to blow out the lamp, and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly and meditatively down stairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was not the smallest danger to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catherine in the little midnight adventure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agwala-town, under MacGregor's guidance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be safer than West Kensington. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">because Hogmanay's mighty right arm was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a source of terror; simply that he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A uniform has frequently been a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death warrant in the Delta; while a gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">flannel shirt and a pair of oil-smeared white</seg><seg type="columnLine">drills have gone blandly through many a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seething caldron of rebellion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And MacGregor believed that this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still the case in spite of the murder of Hugh</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Morrison. Morrison had died because,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded by the strong sunlight on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heights, he had thought himself immune</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the penalty of taking sides in a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's quarrel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that Hogmanay, with two revolvers</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his shirt, was not worrying to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent about what would happen to Cath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erine. He was troubled, however, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the demonstration he would probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to make to induce Agwala to keep his</seg><seg type="columnLine">promises.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he knew that the ponderous chief of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agwala-town was desperately afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     ELSIE and Fran Goddard lay in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosquito-curtained camp beds on</seg><seg type="columnLine">J the Bonny's after deck, partially</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by canvas screens and entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">free from the annoyance of mosquitoes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandflies. It was much more pleasant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie there than to sit on deck under the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and be eaten alive. And simply because one</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to bed, it was not necessary to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where in the world could she have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone?"

"I see his light</seg><seg type="columnLine">is still burning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fiddle, fiddlesticks!"

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">little adventure had a dark, midnight</seg><seg type="columnLine">flavor, it was true, but it lacked the spice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainty. Keeping the mosquitoes away</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to form the most active part of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next bend was accomplished without</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty and in another minute the launch</seg><seg type="columnLine">had scraped alongside Agwala's little wharf</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Hogmanay was saying to the shadow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like figure of the watch boy thereon:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell Agwala I bring Missy Cap'n</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morrison. Make quick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The watch boy, startled by the announce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, shot up the path to the town with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly a second's delay. And he had barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared when another, also carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bobbing hurricane lantern, came forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly from a by-path to the right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently the second watch boy, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw Hogmanay, Garland and Catherine</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb on to the wharf, did not consider him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and his solitary lantern sufficient for so</seg><seg type="columnLine">large a visitation of white people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he made a thick, unintelligible noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his throat and two more watch boys ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared out of the bush with a suddenness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made Catherine jump. She realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Garland had spoken the truth when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stated that Agwala had too many watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garland took a firm grip upon her arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his left hand. His right, under caver</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a broad, flowing four-in-hand tie, rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly on his chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacGregor's beard made a better screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Garland's tie, and as he grunted an</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to the watch boys to go ahead, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression indicated that Agwala was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep the promises he had made at For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cados or else have reason to regret he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever made them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy remained in the launch and smoked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mosquitoes from about his ears. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out expressing any opinion on the matter, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">condemned the whole business utterly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Passing along a broad, well-worn busk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">path and around a single turn, then past</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straggling group of mud-and-wattle huts</seg><seg type="columnLine">that became less scattered and developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a large and fairly compact circle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catherine was aware of only a blurred con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion of shadows and unclean smells, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of indeterminate things that lay around like</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then something huge rose up out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark; something with a light in it; and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood before the house Agwala had built.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a white man's house, and Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agwala was secretly annoyed by the cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstance that he was not the first native</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief who had built one. But it was bigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that of any competitor, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catherine saw it, she wondered if she were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not actually standing before one of Marsden</seg><seg type="columnLine">&amp; Co.'s house-and-shop constructions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a matter of fact, she was. Agwala had</seg><seg type="columnLine">built his house after the pattern of Mars-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den's at Warri. Even the lower of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">floors, in imitation of the customary "shop,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was used as a store-room and, like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general warehouse of the trading-factory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained all things necessary to man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agwala lived "on top." In one corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house there were lamps burning, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Catherine climbed the stairs, she realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had been climbing just such stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">on factory after factory all the way up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Calabar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the top of the stairs, however, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that Agwala-town itself was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it had ever been. It spread out, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Agwala's house, fawning in slavish</seg><seg type="columnLine">squalor at the feet of opulence. Sordid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dank and sinister, and but vaguely in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite of population and purpose, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still but a meager shelter of a groveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, huddling together in the heart of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun-scorched mangrove swamp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So that Agwala's house was all the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">incongruous. It had no place in Catherine's</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture. Particularly at that time of night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His "reception room"--the equivalent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trading-agent's office--was furnished in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wicker from Madeira, and lavishly strewn</seg><seg type="columnLine">with native mats more colorful than Jo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seph's coat. Here and there were enlight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening evidences of Upper Niger handcraft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and needlework.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the extravagant number of lusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored cushions that occupied the wicker</seg><seg type="columnLine">divan and the chairs and overflowed, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, on to the floor, suggested at once to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the initiated that Agwala had become pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed by a fad and had indulged in it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart's content.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He met MacGregor in the doorway lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on to the veranda, and even in his suave</seg><seg type="columnLine">and oily moments--and this was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--he was simply a little less neutral</seg><seg type="columnLine">than usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Doh," he greeted MacGregor, Jakri</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion. "I glad Missy Cap'n Morrison</seg><seg type="columnLine">come look me." He made a heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">stilted courtesy to Catherine. "You sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">down? I hab boy bring drink one time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hogmanay waved the offer of drinks aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a manner that sent Agwala back to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cushioned divan with an inquiring look in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No drink," Hogmanay said shortly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and evidently intended to waste no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the finer points of diplomacy. "Missy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cap'n Morrison came talk trade palaver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savez?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agwala nodded. Apparently he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prospect both new and interesting. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no audible comment, however; simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled himself among his cushions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for the discussion to begin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You 'member you talk with Missy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cap'n Morrison's father at Forcados?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacGregor asked, as Garland casually took</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a position behind Catherine's chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'I 'member.

Sorry</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You 'member you talk trade palaver?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">MacGregor continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I 'member."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then what's matter you no do them</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing you promise to Missy Cap'n Morrison</seg><seg type="columnLine">father?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agwala thought that over. He looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hogmanay with his head a little on one side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then slowly shifted his glance to Cath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I no savez," he said simply--which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Delta native's invariable answer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything he does not care to understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thick guttural whisperings from the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage lifted themselves into the short silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that followed; a restless sound like that of •</seg><seg type="columnLine">some large animal moving uneasily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Gray Charteris</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grunting in its sleep. Hogmanay permit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted ttfe silence to hold for fully a minute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he looked the bulky chief over from</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh!" It was not often that Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregor sneered. His contempt for Agwala</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to radiate from him in sparks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You no savez, eh? You're a small-boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eh? No get sense in your head?" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached his feet suddenly. "You lie!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savez? You lie like bushman. You trade</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Siluko, in Koratown, and at Jardine</seg><seg type="columnLine">hulk and in Lagos. You think I be</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Agwala's eyes flattened just a little; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shrugged his shoulders so that they al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most touched his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say I lie? Be all righ'. You be big</seg><seg type="columnLine">man pass me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And his glance traveled to Catherine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garland, as if to inquire whether they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not agree with him that MacGregor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bigger and more powerful man than he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hogmanay sat down again and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">another tack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You trade in Siluko?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Li'l bit," Agwala admitted with oily</seg><seg type="columnLine">simplicity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Koratown?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Li'l bit.

But them time you talk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Missy Cap'n Morrison's father at Forcados,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you talked different mouth. No be so?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another expressive shrug of the shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the most of Agwala's answer. To which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he added that if MacGregor was so con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that he was a liar, there was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to be gained by him saying anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hogmanay's right hand slipped under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard and Garland's sought the cover of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">four-in-hand tie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Catherine simply sat and watched Ag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wala's fat, shiny and imperturbable coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenance with the fascination of one who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid to speak in case it might spoil the</seg><seg type="columnLine">performance. Even the bat that whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">eerily past the door in its circling flight over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stertorously slumbering village, did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">distract her attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When white man make promise," Hog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manay said slowly, "white man do what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">say.

Savez?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agwala understood that and admitted it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">so Hogmanay asked--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You make promise to Missy Cap'n</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morrison's father at Forcados?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I make li'l bit promise.

Palaver set."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hogmanay did not agree with Agwala's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophism. His hand came slowly from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath his beard and descended, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">any fuss or demonstration of hostility to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee. Garland's hand also appeared from</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his tie and came to rest leisurely on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of Catherine's chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Char</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then, just as she felt Garland's</seg><seg type="columnLine">free hand grasp her shoulder warningly, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catherine saw Agwala's expression change.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As if the craven fear that lurked behind its</seg><seg type="columnLine">smug and self-satisfied shelter of fat were</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly uncertain of its security, a massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of restlessness shook him from head to</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot. He sat bolt upright and the whites of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes showed for the first time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Catherine stole a sidelong glance at Mac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregor and discovered a large blue-barreled</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver resting quietly--but only too sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificantly--on his knee. And, following</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agwala's fear-filled look behind her, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the glint of another revolver barrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rested almost indifferently on the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garland's grip on her shoulder tightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little and she exhaled a deep breath sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly. Then smiled. This, she admitted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with another glimpse at Agwala's graying</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance, was most interesting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shrill whistling of the crickets in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush seemed to grow louder and louder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the low drone of voices somewhere not far</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant made the possibilities of the situa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion assume an explosive quality that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exciting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, we go talk," MacGregor said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "And we go talk true talk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savez?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "E-yaw!

The chief knew at once that</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever protection he might be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">afford himself later, he was, just then, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hopeless position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I---I no savez what's the matter," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">whined, and looking toward Catherine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to be friendly and indignant at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">io6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">same time.

Then Hogmanay interpreted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catherine's dictum, and added a few re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks on his own account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The effect upon Agwala was most marked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked from Hogmanay to Catherine in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bewildered fashion, and it was evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he did not know what to make of Missy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cap'n Morrison. There was a quality in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadiness of her gray eyes that bothered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him considerably. And, of course, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the guns that made his fat quiver and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upset his powers of thought completely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Catherine had an idea of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own. Perhaps it was a dangerous idea, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment ' it came to her, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">compelled to give voice * to it. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke so sharply that even Hogmanay was</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell him, on second thought, I may</seg><seg type="columnLine">change my mind about the promises that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were made at Forcados.

Tell him, also, that if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is looking for a fight, with guns or without</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, Marsden &amp; Co. will give him one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will make him the sorriest Jakri in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benin River."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Garland wanted to cheer, but Hogmanay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">canny as usual and having some difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in concealing his surprize at Catherine's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden vehemence, hesitated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on.

Who the dickens is</seg><seg type="columnLine">he that we should have to come here at this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">time of night to argue fine distinctions</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agwala saw the fire in Catherine's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite plainly. And, as Hogmanay had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, he knew the difference between a mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of the family and a servant. MacGreg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">or's attitude increased the difference, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garland, standing behind Catherine's chair in</seg><seg type="columnLine">so protecting a position, heightened the effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What--what's matter?" Agwala asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Catherine respectfully. "You no savez I</seg><seg type="columnLine">be your friend?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Catherine dismissed the plea with a ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture that left no doubt, in Agwala's mind at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, of her position in the matter. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned quickly to Hogmanay and said</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a little impatiently:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, go on! Tell him what I said. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">could also tell him, just for effect, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abado isn't dead yet. I'm sure he wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to be reminded of that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> MacGregor's eyes brightened for a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond. He nodded slowly and thoughtfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally began where Catherine left off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He asked Agwala to remember that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abado was still very much alive. Also, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sobo was proved guilty of Morrison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder, he was innocent in the sight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man's law, and his trade, in its sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance at least, was just as purchasable as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of any other trader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore, since Agwala had not kept his</seg><seg type="columnLine">promises, Marsden &amp; Co. did not feel under</seg><seg type="columnLine">any obligation to keep theirs. They could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not trust Agwala again and did not care to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a new agreement. If they wished to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade with Abado's boys, they would do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such, MacGregor concluded for the sake</seg><seg type="columnLine">of emphasis, was the decision of Missy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cap'n Morrison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agwala gasped. His fat hands orna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented with diamonds that splashed rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than sparkled, pawed the air then in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to make himself understood. Cather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ine was plainly, as Hogmanay had pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicted, an element he had not considered for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment.

When he touched her arm to assure</seg><seg type="columnLine">her of his protecting presence, he discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was trembling, and she drew away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him as though she did not want to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't seem to be very welcome?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charteris said, breaking the pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, ye're welcome enough," Hogmanay</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared, studying the unique-situation as</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannily as possible.

And when, for his dignity's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake, he did try to get a grip upon himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was on the point of uttering a blustering</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest, Charteris calmly struck him hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the mouth with the back of his hand!</seg><seg type="columnLine">io8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here, man, here!

Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he was ready enough to speak in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own defense, there was no rebellion in him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Charteris chose to insist upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Roku!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chief of Dowadda lurched to Bark's</seg><seg type="columnLine">side almost without demur.

Swimming as, in the Jakri</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, only Ogulo-of-the-long-arms could</seg><seg type="columnLine">swim, the dwarf speedily left the satellites</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Agwala far behind and headed directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Hogmanay's breakwater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arrived there, he cautiously became pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed of a canoe that belonged to Marsden</seg><seg type="columnLine">&amp; Co., and, without any compunction or</seg><seg type="columnLine">apologies, he paddled out into mid-stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then headed straight up river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS the following morning that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agwala's forty-paddle canoe swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside Marsden &amp; Co.'s gig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharf.

She did not really</seg><seg type="columnLine">need the boots, but she thought she needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the diversion of Garland's service and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration. And, seated on a low pile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray flannel trousers at the far end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop, trying on mosquito boots, Elsie was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unquestionably a diversion worthy of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop clerk's most devoted attention, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardless of how disillusioned and unsenti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental he might be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward she was going over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kernel store to try to make the tall, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">dramatic-looking kernel clerk become confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dential. From what she had seen of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked as if he were struggling valiantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a secret sorrow and Elsie liked to listen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and try to be helpful in cases of the kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Agwala waddled up from the gig-wharf</seg><seg type="columnLine">and along Hogmanay's veranda with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloated look of injury on his face. • When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned the corner, so that he came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">full view, MacGregor put his hand on Tom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">my Dillingworth's arm and said quietly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No. Keep your seat.

He glanced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy again merely as an excuse to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attention from Hogmanay, and then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked out toward the Bonny and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jardine hulk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I go trade for hulk," he said sullenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right.

MacGregor's sarcasm did not miss its</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark. Just at that moment the number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes about the hulk was something less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than half a dozen. Consequently, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no balm in that direction. Agwala</seg><seg type="columnLine">might sell, for high prices, on credit if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared to. But he knew there was no cloth</seg><seg type="columnLine">or gin or salt or rice to be found anywhere---</seg><seg type="columnLine">except in the shops and warehouses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marsden &amp; Co., and the trading-companies</seg><seg type="columnLine">affiliated with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a minute, perhaps, he stood flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">footed, facing Hogmanay, his great bulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocking slowly with a rage that was but</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly expressed in the flatness of his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then suddenly MacGregor rose, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy made a quick grab for his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mac!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get off my beach!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Careful, Mac!

Tommy's hold on Hogmanay's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right arm tightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Och! Why should I haud my hands?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was almost a lament. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in Hogmanay's normally twinkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes that Tommy had never seen before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agwala took his departure as hastily as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, and waddled down to the gig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharf again. MacGregor stood between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of the veranda uprights, a large hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped about each of them, and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">every scuffling step the fat chief took.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He continued to watch as Agwala's</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe drew away from the gig-wharf and</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed, as Hogmanay thought, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht. But Agwala's destination proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be the hulk, and when MacGregor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of that, he let his hands fall to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides and observed,if or the first time in several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, that Tommy was still at his elbow:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dod! I hope he'll no' tempt me like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that again!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO BE CONCLUDED</seg><seg type="columnLine">N A certain day in the long ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">five gunmen descended from</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding hillsides and closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in on Henry Madrigal, cowman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had assumed squatter's rights in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Andres Mountains before Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">surveyors had parceled out the country for</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes of homesteading and purchase.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madrigal fought a valorous but losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle, drilling two of his assailants into</seg><seg type="columnLine">eternal silence before the combat reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand-to-hand stage. Then he clubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his long-barreled six-shooter and rendered</seg><seg type="columnLine">two more temporarily helpless before a bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let nicked his valiant Old heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Madrigal lived long enough to demand</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some one look after his "children"--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little boy and girl, presumably waifs, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">were known to be living with him. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disappeared, and the supposition was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the killers had included them in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughter, but disposed of the bodies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashamed of their inhumanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madrigal also, during the last hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life, told Sam Barnhill, owner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fying Y, in lurid and specific detail what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he died, a martyr to the cause of</seg><seg type="columnLine">range freedom. In traditions of the South-</seg><seg type="columnLine">west he still lives as a criterion of courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two of the gunmen, of course, required</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but burial for their services. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other pair apparently received what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought they were worth and left for parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zeigline, the one killer who remained</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on his feet when Madrigal fell, squatted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the location until Uncle Sam's engineers</seg><seg type="columnLine">platted, plotted and surveyed the San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andres. Shortly thereafter title to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madrigal place passed to Barnhill--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madrigal in his last moments had prophe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sied it would. Zeigline received his "pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of silver" in live stock bearing a Box X</seg><seg type="columnLine">brand--which, analyzed, was nothing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">or less than the Madrigal "M" amplified</seg><seg type="columnLine">and doctored by the branding-iron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even at that time Barnhill was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolling range factor. His five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of cattle dotted the Flats that spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a canopy at the eastern base of the San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andres. Madrigal had nested, several</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles back in the mountains with a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch of live stock. This had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madrigal's western range boundary identi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal with the eastern limits of Flying Y,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was intolerable to Barnhill, who saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it a design to usurp his empire and steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cattle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had dealt with it accordingly, vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously and expensively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The old Madrigal place" thus became</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the numerous Flying Y camps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later it was known as "Madrigal place."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Today it is referred to as "Madrigal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this experience Barnhill looked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his defenses, determined never again to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">afflicted by nesters. Like many great</seg><seg type="columnLine">generals, however, he overlooked one strate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gic position. The Hackberry Hills bit a</seg><seg type="columnLine">right-angled chasm into the southwestern</seg><seg type="columnLine">extremity of the Flats and constituted a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JI5</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ii6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"No Man's Land" into which Flying Y</seg><seg type="columnLine">cattle seldom ventured because of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">remoteness from water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barnhill never bothered to acquire title</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Hackberry Hills because everyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it for granted that his "control"</seg><seg type="columnLine">included them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">g2{F3 THUS, for almost three decades,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vi Sam Barnhill dominated the range</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmolested by nesters.

He had departed the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown and returned equally so. He took</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing for granted, but looked up land</seg><seg type="columnLine">office records and discovered that Hack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berry Hills were "open territory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He entered into a partnership with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youthful, ebullient and wholly efficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thad Wyman and developed a ranch con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisting of two-room bunk-house, corral,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon-shed, well and several hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of cattle which fattened in the Grama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grassed hills and valleys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among other things Bern brought back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him forty years of ripe experience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muscularity of youth and a keen desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to plant his wandering foot where it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take root.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tradition that a rolling stone gathers</seg><seg type="columnLine">no moss held true with Bern.

The physical burnishing was man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ifested in the smooth bronze of his always</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean-shaved face where character lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">were etched lightly, due to the firm flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">underneath preventing deeper inroads. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental refinement was reflected in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech, due probably to a painstaking study</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pure Castilian--a sure guide to perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">English--and an ability to quote Shakespere</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ease and accuracy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bern had drunk of the Rio Grande years</seg><seg type="columnLine">before and had responded to another tra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition that "when you drink of the Rio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grande, you must return before you die."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bern was far from dead, but he answered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lure of the muddy waters nevertheless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He returned, not to die, but to live. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure, the Rio Grande flowed ten miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">west of the Hackberry Hills--but tradition</seg><seg type="columnLine">is allowed that much latitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bond of affection, admiration and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spect linked Bern and his youthful partner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite aside from their business relationship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Friends characterized them as "Tiger" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Cub."

Goren pondered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It couldn't be done! The dead weight of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yearling on the end of a thirty-foot rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all the average cow-pony could move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More than double that weight on even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty-foot rope would either stall two horses</seg><seg type="columnLine">or break the rope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ninety feet of it would be impossible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bern would discover this only after experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that might be disastrous.

Would he take it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the B. W. ranch? Probably.

If Bern didn't, the law</seg><seg type="columnLine">would.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The saddle slipped gratifyingly after</seg><seg type="columnLine">another fifteen minutes of writhing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing; it fell to the ground, and the leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirts pinioned his spurs.

All he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to do now was to catch his horse, saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and leave promptly in a southerly di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection. He started to unfasten the cinch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckles from around the cedar, wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Bern might be and what doing--</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he heard the clattering hoof-beats of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">galloping horse on the ridge to the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew then that Bern had upset the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time calculation in some manner and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned a full five minutes too soon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goren abandoned the saddle and rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward his horse--which shied at his hasty</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach.

Oksook was not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> an Indian. His was a parentage of a burly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Russian soldier and an Eskimo squaw. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had spent his fatherless youth and early</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> manhood on the desolate salt marshes of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yukon delta. What a terrible struggle for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> existence it had been, searching the bliz-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> zard-swept floes for seal and walrus, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> crouching through the long Winters in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stinking igloos. The hardships had forged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> him into a powerful, sinewy hunter who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> threw a harpoon with accuracy and force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Then had come the gold-strike up the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yukon at Dawson. Thousands of white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> men came hurrying north to the Island of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> St. Michael. Great river-boats were built</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to carry the passengers and freight up-river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    It was on one of these boats that Oksook</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> got a job as pilot and came to leave the dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mal wastes by the Bering. There were no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> eyes keener than Oksook's to detect snags</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and sand-bars beneath the roily waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time brought him far up the Yukon to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 128</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oksook</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tananas. Disease and whisky had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet contaminated this sturdy tribe, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oksook found the lithe, slender squaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to his liking. They were not like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat, greasy Eskimo women on the coast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With his new manners and air of bravado</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up from the boisterous boat crews he</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon ingratiated himself into the favor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tribe. Cunning and patience inherited</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his Slav father gained him fame and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prestige. He came to be known among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various tribes on the Yukon and Tanana</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivers as Oksook, the Great Medicine-Man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Month after month, year after year he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his little cabin among his pots and bags</seg><seg type="columnLine">of herbs, brewing, muttering and sleeping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the hunters brought him the fattest</seg><seg type="columnLine">salmon and sweetest moose livers. In re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn for these favors Oksook made charms</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that when the countless hordes of caribou</seg><seg type="columnLine">migrated north to their Winter feeding-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds in the Koyokuk they always crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yukon near the village of the Tananas.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Always it was his medicine that filled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">caches with fish. Therefore as he grew old</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fat Oksook smiled and was happy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But there came a Summer when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">salmon changed the course of their run and</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoided the squeaking fish-wheels. of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tananas. Farther up the river the drying</seg><seg type="columnLine">racks of the Kantishna tribe swayed under</seg><seg type="columnLine">their heavy loads of oily fish. Soon Oksook's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribesmen began to murmur and criticise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Day after day he stewed and concocted</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong medicines, but the dipping baskets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wheels splashed idly and brought up</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing--a few small whitefish and gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling. When Fall came the caribou followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new ridge north and 'crossed the river far</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the Tananas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kantishnas laughed gleefully and</seg><seg type="columnLine">boasted of strong medicine as they traded</seg><seg type="columnLine">their fish and meat to the Tananas for fox</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beaver-skins. Now came also a noisy</seg><seg type="columnLine">little missionary, who told them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oksook's medicine was fraud and Oksook</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ruined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus it was that the old native became</seg><seg type="columnLine">the joke of the village and an object at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the boys threw sticks and the squaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">scolded when he begged for bits of meat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast-off moccasins. Each year as he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">starved and became more wretched the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man grew more bitter and morose. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">long since ceased making medicine, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">every morning left the village with its vici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous urchins and went down the trail to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Tanana where he loitered about the saloons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stores. Often he met white men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known him when he had been famous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sometimes they gave him money and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this Winter promised to be long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard and the old medicine-man felt uneasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">when at night he heard the malemiuts</seg><seg type="columnLine">mourn with their pointed noses toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">J\ ALL day it had been snowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">vtgk heavily and with the darkness had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a bitter wind that sobbed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chimneys and frightened little puffs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke out through the stove cracks. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">big, round stove in Mickey's Place glowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in furious competition with the fiery</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky that burned the throats of Mickey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">customers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This night the talk had taken a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nugget Bill, a squaw-man, was speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the men who clustered about him in deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yep," he was saying, "that bunch o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Siwashes up at the village are scared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death.

As the dogs and man</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged from the sheltering willow thicket</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lined the beach the storm caught them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drove its stinging blasts of sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystals under clothing and into fur.

The winds came not</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a steady violence but seemed to crouch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hesitate, and then hurled themselves for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward with redoubled fury. During these</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals only could Riley see the bushy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail of his wheel dog. Twice he stopped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">team, went forward and peered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling blackness ahead; but the flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow had obliterated the trail, and struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">low against the hurricane to regain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleigh he cursed the fates that had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Kitty who gave warning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole.

Neither Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor half-breeds could buy liquor over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bar in Tanana, but a detour to the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">door always resulted in a flaskful of a mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derous concoction prepared only for natives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The news of the fearful noises coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Bull Island and their terrorizing effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Indians in the village had spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly among Tanana's few inhabitants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus because of his once having been medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cine-man, Oksook found himself the object</seg><seg type="columnLine">of continual banter and some ridicule.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first he took it good-naturedly, smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagely to himself; but as the day wore on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he drank more and more of his flask,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his good humor changed to irritation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger which did not decrease the sport but</seg><seg type="columnLine">served rather to aggravate it to mockery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This continued more or less throughout the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day until evening came with its more boister-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous gathering in the saloons. He retorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his tormentors with snarls of wounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanity until at last unable to withstand any</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer the continuous attack, he staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a chair in the barroom where he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sitting and shouted frantically to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">revilers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me show you.

With the fumes of the poison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous whisky lashing him to a frenzy of des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair and anguish he bowed his head into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm and followed a heedless direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">which led him not up the trail to the village,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but down on to the wind-scourged surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one but a drunken Eskimo could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten his way up against that freezing</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm. He followed no straightway course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but buffeted from side to side by the blasts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped and floundered among the troughs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">powdery crystals between the clean-swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice-ridges. The worn webbing on his old</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow shoes soon parted leaving the useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">frames dangling unheeded about his knees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not feel the bitter winds nor suffer</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the stinging particles; his mind para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyzed from the liquor served but one pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose, to impel him forward and forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the tremendous heart action induced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the stimulant began to fail the old man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oksook</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">133</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Gradually his limbs commenced to shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his pounding brain to cool. As his</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadened faculties came back to conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness he became aware of a sinister blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to his right. It was the open water</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Bull Island. With the immunity of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep-walker he had been staggering along</seg><seg type="columnLine">its jagged edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time he stood peering vacantly out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the murky expanse. No recollection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of1 the terrifying mystery disturbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-conscious study. The waters seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely soft and inviting. He felt an</seg><seg type="columnLine">overpowering desire to sink into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothing depths, out of the biting winds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therb was something hypnotic about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white flakes that silently sought the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface to sink gently out of view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lurching forward he stood swaying uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly over the very rim. As he watched,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river appeared suddenly to rise before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Out of the depths was emerging a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, glistening body from which a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous eyes stared malevolently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before he could draw back a gushing roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shook the air, beating into his ears an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar sound of his youth, a sound that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oksook knew and loved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His shout of joy was drowned in a, shower</seg><seg type="columnLine">of freezing water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ot-si-kee!" he yelled in Eskimo. "She</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows! She blows!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the old rallying cry of the whale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then for a moment he stood silent, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the black body as it skirted the rim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearing at length in the darkness. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of the intense cold a warm feeling of joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">diffused his benumbed frame. Once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be Oksook, the Great Man, a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be respected, a man to be deferred to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must capture the great fish this very</seg><seg type="columnLine">night before the secret be discovered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How the whale happened to be so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its natural habitat did not perplex</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; his years as pilot on the lower river</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him that. So preoccupied was he with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plans that on his way back across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river he did not feel the biting wind nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind the rough going. In fact the storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be diminishing in violence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once in his cabin he hastily sought an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old bundle brought with him when he first</seg><seg type="columnLine">came among the Tananas. From it he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wicked looking harpoon head to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was attached a long, heavy, native whale-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">line. It was still in good condition. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted a shaft into the barbed steel he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hummed a weird old hunting-chant of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth, the days when he had been the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">harpooner of the tribe. Several times he</seg><seg type="columnLine">flourished the dangerous weapon at imagi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary objects and was surprized to find his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm still retained its former skill. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">arming himself with his rifle and ax he</seg><seg type="columnLine">started back to the opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The furious winds had dwindled to a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent whispers when Oksook again reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place where he had seen the whale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Overhead above the scudding clouds, a flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon disk glanced palely through ragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">fringes. A dim light was diffused over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, but the whale was nowhere to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without waiting, however, for it to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear Oksook began to prepare for its cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture. About midway between the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremities of the opening he selected near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge a large ice chunk which he hewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the semblance of a stump. Around</seg><seg type="columnLine">this he wound his line, leaving enough free</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he might throw his harpoon a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable distance. This done he laid his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle and ax near and awaited his oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity. Long years of hunting on the ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">floes in the Bering stood him in good stead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With Eskimo patience he waited hour after</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour for the great creature to appear. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">it rose with a high spout, but it was far over</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the island, and as it sank once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oksook wondered how long it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">before morning would bring the Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">and white men to share in the capture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus deprive him of the sole honor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The malemiuts in the village had begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">their morning chorus when Oksook again</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted the swirl in the water that betrayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of his prey. It was rising near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rim and on its way up-stream would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass directly by. Closer and closer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening back came, gliding swiftly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. It would be an easy throw if his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm did not fail him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His first nervousness was passing off. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew back his arm tensely, leaned forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then hurled the harpoon into the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">form as it surged past. The instantaneous</seg><seg type="columnLine">whip of the heavy line almost upset him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he retained a hold on the snub end. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific splashing and floundering turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole morning into confusion. Great waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bloody spray came lashing up on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice. He did not dare to let the line out</seg><seg type="columnLine">134</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">because he knew he could not pull the broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">hulk up against the swift current.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had the'whale been in the prime of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength the line would never have held,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but weakened by the lack of food and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects of fresh water, the beast could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">exert its normal power and therefore soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watching his chance, Oksook secured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line and held his rifle ready to shoot when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spray should clear. Gradually the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty lashings grew feebler and feebler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the waves subsiding, he saw the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide awash. As the loud reports of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy caliber rifle echoed and re-echoed</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the bluffs a fresh commotion shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water, but this time it was shorter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again the enormous body grew still and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted over against the rim of ice. To in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure his catch Oksook took his ax and sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">it deep into the back, severing the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertebrae.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A distant shout from the village drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention.

He pulled it out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread it. It was a ten-dollar bill. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no idea in the world how it had found its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way into his pocket; but it was there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not one to look a gift horse in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth.

The insistent tinny drumming of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the phone reached his ears. He had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea it was probably for him, but as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water grew colder he burst forth discordant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, though with enthusiasm, into the chorus:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, g-l-o-r-y, my friends, I was s-a-v-e-d.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I never hit the ground too hard in my good s-h-i-p;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd rather have white whiskers than die y-o-u-n-g;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Give other guys the glory--I'm still a-l-i-v-e!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned the warm water completely off</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began to dance briskly under a cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinging flood.

A thundering formation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Liberty-motored De Havilands from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombardment group roared its majestic</seg><seg type="columnLine">way above the field, its unvarying regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larity testifying to the flying ability of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilots. Handling a ton-and-a-half ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping it twenty-five feet, no more and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, from the ship ahead and in precise</seg><seg type="columnLine">position in three dimensions is no task for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amateur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spears slowly passed the flying-depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment hangars. A dozen ships of different</seg><seg type="columnLine">types were lined up on the edge of the field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranging from the tiny Sopwith Camel up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big twin-motored bomber. The me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanics, dressed uniformly in coveralls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were busily wiping down the ships in prep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aration for the half-holiday. Dick Cart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mell waved and jeered as Sleepy made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">leisurely way past the bench, and Beale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was in helmet and goggles for a flight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned at him cheerfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next group of hangars housed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">140</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">airplane department, where riggers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufactured from raw youngsters who</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought to learn the technique of a still new</seg><seg type="columnLine">profession. Sleepy straightened his hat as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he entered the first big structure, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him keenly as he walked the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. All around were groups of students,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each under an instructor, who were doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything from doping linen to putting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">final touches on a big De Haviland which</seg><seg type="columnLine">that particular class had assembled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleepy grinned in reminiscent compla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cency at the memory of the hard days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">toil he had put in shaping the department</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that it was self-running.

The trip was a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty miles. He figured they would get</seg><seg type="columnLine">there in an hour, which would be one o'clock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and just the time that Gib Saunders would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be expecting them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned around and slowly fed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throttle. The Le Pere gathered speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly, and in a sdcond was speeding across</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riding Herd-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground like a bullet. Slow pressure on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stick brought the tail up, and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he knew it they were in the air. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the ship close to the ground for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, and then lifted it upward in a beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful 300m that brought them to three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet. The air was very bumpy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even the heavy, solid Le Pere was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounced around in the air currents as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled the field three times, getting altitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At two thousand feet Spears flew over</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Antonio, carefully picking out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroads leading eastward.

Five miles farther on a fork</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tracks, the southern branch leading to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Gulf of Mexico, was additional veri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fication that he was right, so he settled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably in his seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Usually flying was merely mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him.

The swift rush of the air past</seg><seg type="columnLine">him was cool and comfortable in contrast</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the baking land below, and as the Le</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pere hurled itself through the misty lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges of cloud after cloud the feel of the cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">moisture was the acme of physical delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Le Pere was the pride of the school--</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the only two of the type on Donovan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Field.

The strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">built ship would stand it almost as well as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spad, so he allowed the air-speed meter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go up to a hundred and eighty miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour the while he carefully handled the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•Modern Style	141</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">throttle until, despite their terrific speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 450 horse-power Liberty was only turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fifteen hundred revolutions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a meteor the big black-and-white</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship shot toward the sundrenched earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thousand feet below. It was a smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">country of alternate flat cotton-fields and</seg><seg type="columnLine">small patches of mesquite, splotched with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow as the snowy cumulus clouds drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Correll, in the black cockpit, leaned over</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously and treated the instrument-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, which he could see from his seat, to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful inspection. There was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong there, and the motor was certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing evenly and without missing, so the</seg><seg type="columnLine">portly mechanic leaned back again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted all his attention to blowing out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears to keep the change in pressure from</seg><seg type="columnLine">deafening him. Every few seconds he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped his nose firmly, kept his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, and blew hard, Spears following his</seg><seg type="columnLine">example as they sped ever nearer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were diving parallel with the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, and at two hundred feet Sleepy grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually came out of the dive, easing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throttle on slowly as he came level. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty feet, directly over the railroad, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was flying in normal position, the motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning 1550.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spears leaned forward and opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutters, which he had closed for the dive</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep the motor from cooling too fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he settled down to fly the railroad--</seg><seg type="columnLine">every curve of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a hundred and forty miles an hour, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few feet above the wires, the Le Pere roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way down the railroad. The sensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of speed, almost indiscernible a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet or more high, was now paramount.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little town of Carston heard the ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing roar of the motor, and stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its midday lethargy to sweep the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">with languid interest. It grew into as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonished wonder as a black-and-white</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor shot across the housetops, the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad station and on down the railroad so</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, "Here she comes!" followed by,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There she goes!" were about the only com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments a reasonably intelligent and quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">witted person could encompass before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Pere was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleepy, his attitude still relaxed as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">guided the mighty machine beneath him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was smiling slightly, and the lazy gray eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were glowing softly. It was the kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">142</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flying that has killed many a pilot, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances of a crack-up in case of motor failure</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very promising. However, it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression of a spirit without which there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never have been a conquest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air; scientists may experiment, but some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one must take a chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes of flashing progress along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shining steel rails left the motor at 8o°</seg><seg type="columnLine">Centigrade--not too hot. A stretch of big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">level cotton-flelds on his right tempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleepy to bank away from the railroad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dropped down to five, and skimmed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tops of the cotton plants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached a fence a tiny zoom took</seg><seg type="columnLine">him over it. A cluster of houses loomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, and with a world of excess speed he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted the Le Pere in a smooth, curving zoom</seg><seg type="columnLine">that cleared the houses by a hundred feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dropped down again for a wild rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a straight half-mile of waving corn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A BIG, level stretch of closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">cropped grass showed ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thirty or more horses and mules</seg><seg type="columnLine">were grazing in it. Sleepy obeyed a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse and dived along the eastern edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field, close to the fence. A dozen of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals who were occupying that section</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicked up their heels and departed hastily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zooming up at the other end of the field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleepy noted that one mule had not re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated far enough, so he shot down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">herded the recalcitrant beast into the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch, along the western boundary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This accomplished, he circled back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field a few hundred yards, slowly cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throttle, and stalled over the fence, landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly on three points. With a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick thrusts of gas he turned around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxied back to the fence, and pointed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose down the field in preparation for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">take-off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the trouble, lieutenant?" in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired Correll anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just wanted a smoke," returned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, stretching mightily as he reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sergeant took a full minute to digest</seg><seg type="columnLine">this information. He grinned as he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Spears, now puffing contentedly as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay on the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Must be--er--feeling pretty good to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, lieutenant," he ventured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, not so bad, not so good," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spears airily. "Light up--we haven't got</seg><seg type="columnLine">much time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship was idling softly. The airmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay restfully on the ground, undergoing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">severe inspection of the horses and mules,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had retired to the farthermost limits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spears moved a trifle to get in the breeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">generated by the propeller, and then moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again with a grunt of disgust as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted that he would lose his cigaret if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained there. He lay motionless, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm over his eyes to keep out the blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance of the noon-high sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had inhaled the last possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply of smoke from his diminutive cigaret-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stub he sat up, yawned, and put on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">goggles. Correll threw away his smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">and climbed in the rear. In a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were roaring across the field, taking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air before its length was half-covered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They flew straight down the railroad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing gradually, until once again they</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the cool air under the clouds against</seg><seg type="columnLine">their faces. Spears shook the stick, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Correll leaned forward. Spears cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor for a moment as he yelled--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fly it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Correll nodded with much satisfaction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could keep a ship level in the air all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, and took great delight in an oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity to demonstrate his ability. Spears</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed his map back to the mechanic, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his finger indicated their precise posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Correll nodded his comprehension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spears settled deeply into his seat, so far</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the wind-shield that he scarcely felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the terrific air pressure compounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their speed and the propeller's blast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The motor was running well within its pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibilities at fifteen hundred revolutions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His arms rested limply on the cowling, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes gazed calmly on the clouds drifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">just above them. The roar of the motor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its hypnotic monotony, lulled him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsiness and in a moment, sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a wonder he awakened just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they arrived alt Gonzara. Sergeant Correll</seg><seg type="columnLine">was just deciding that it was time to lean</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and shake the pilot when Spears stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked around. As they came over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly large town he saw a railroad crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and recognized Gonzara. His wrist-watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed 1:10.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was familiar with the landing-field,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quickly picked it up. The wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading grove next to it--the location for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the barbecue--was swarming with tiny, ant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like specks, and the smoke of the barbecue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riding Herd--Modern Style</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">143</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fires, rising almost straight in the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided a good wind-vane. Evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was practically no wind on the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as there was being from the south.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The field itself ran north and south, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it as convenient as could be wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">for landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Correll had climbed to five thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the way. Spears took the stick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled it back as far as it would go, applying</seg><seg type="columnLine">left rudder at the same time. The nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up until the ship was almost per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendicular in the air, and then fell off to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left in a whirling dive. Spears cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor half-way--he did not throttle fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">because that would foul the spark-plugs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was very possible that he would need</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good motor before making his landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heavy Le Pere, with a thousand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound motor in its nose running half-open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">screwed downward in a terrific vertical tail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin. Four hundred feet a turn, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns came so fast it was almost impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to count them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleepy watched the ground calmly, oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casionally blowing out his ears for com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort's sake. He kept an eye on the alti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meter, which was wabbling crazily in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort to keep up with the rushing loss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every wire was screaming with the speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Correll, experienced passenger though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was, was dizzy and sick as the big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashily painted ship corkscrewed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last thousand feet. Sleepy grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly as he caught kaleidoscopic views of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd below, now motionless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some of 'em are getting the roofs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mouths sunburnt,-' he reflected as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed on right rudder and pushed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A turn more, and the Le Pere straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened out in a vertical dive. It took four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet before the nose started coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">up as Sleepy eased the stick back slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not so easy to do against the force of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind on the elevators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three hundred feet above the ground the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was level, and the motor came full on</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Spears circled the long, narrow landing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, eying it closely for possible ditches or</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack-brained onlookers who might be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way. Satisfied that Gib Saunders, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one equally wise, was warning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd to keep away, he made a wide circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and approached the field in a slow dive from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slow" in a Le Pere means around ninety</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour. The throttle crawled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">by degrees until it was idling as the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped over the trees and dropped down until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was two feet above the ground. Know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the gliding propensities of his ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleepy kicked the rudder and sent the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a skid that helped kill their speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They wrere less than fifty yards from the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the field when they stopped rolling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he taxied toward the western edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field, which was packed with people</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had temporarily deserted the barbecue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pilot spied a dancing figure in the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground that he recognized readily. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that distance there was no mistaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red hair and somewhat portly form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ex-Lieutenant Gib Saunders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleepy taxied toward Saunders, stopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few feet in front of the crowd that poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">out behind the one-time pilot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Burn out the motor; will you, Correll?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">requested Spears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Correll climbed into the front seat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned off one of the gas pet-cocks as Sleepy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbled off the wing into the flailing arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Saunders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so vigorous, Gib, not so vigorous,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spears cautioned with his widest grin as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">freckle-faced, bright-eyed comrade of over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas days seemed bent on knocking the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of him with tremendous thumps on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back.

The roar of the air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane motor, which Correll was warming up</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the advent of the gas to save time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a constant and exciting reminder to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd of what was to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only calm human being at the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">becue was Lieutenant John Spears, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in semi-hiding behind an isolated tree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Gib's company, to avoid being bothered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with questions.

It was three-thirty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and according to Cal's story the robbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had almost three hours start. Probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ninety miles, reflected Spears, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">something had happened. Saunders knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">every foot of the country, and had said that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were no side roads that the thieves</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be likely to take.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came to the fork in the road, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleepy guided the plane squarely down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle line between the two. For fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles ahead the roads were not more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten miles apart, the gap between them grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually widening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had sighted only two cars driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the way they were traveling, both</seg><seg type="columnLine">very small ones. They had played safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dropped earthward for a close look.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The country was not thickly settled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">such traffic as there was, which was small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was toward Gonzara and not away from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saunders was watching the right-hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, and Spears the left. They had trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ersed about fifteen miles on a line between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two when Gib reached over and shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pilot. He pointed down to a tiny speck</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling along the road, toward San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Antonio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleepy nodded and nosed down. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not believe it was their car. He figured</seg><seg type="columnLine">that to be several miles ahead. What he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not figure on was the stop the desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">adoes had made on a side road to chain Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saunders securely in a deserted shack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they had left him with sufficient food</seg><seg type="columnLine">and water to last three days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were a thousand feet high when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the car, and as he circled over it</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleepy noted that it was large and black</seg><seg type="columnLine">and* traveling fast. The country under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath was mostly mesquite, although iso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated cleared spots could be seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Le Pere, under his handling, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">skimming the tops of the trees several hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred yards back of the car. Sleepy flew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">parallel to the road, as low as possible, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">throttled the motor slightly as they shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. There were several men in the car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was certain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gib, a long-barreled rifle in his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned over the rear cockpit as far as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stretch, trying his utmost to identify</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one in the car. They flashed by so</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, however, that they could come to no</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spears turned the throttle full on, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled back once more. He could scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that was the car, and yet it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. Certainly the passengers had craned</seg><seg type="columnLine">their necks to the utmost to watch them;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that would be only natural for anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do in view of the low flying he was doing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the next trip past the car the thieves</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave themselves away. Probably it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of Gib's rifle, and the fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling of the plane denoted suspicion. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two flyers shot by, their heads turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they strained their eyes toward the car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw two revolvers spit flame at them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gib's face was alight with exultation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes flashed fire through the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">goggles. The shots did not bother them</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly--a fast moving plane is about</seg><seg type="columnLine">as difficult a target as there is extant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleepy pointed backward, and Gib nod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ded. The map showed that the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">was without cross-cuts for twenty miles--</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the time the car covered that they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be back again after signaling the posse</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With motor turning eighteen hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and speedmeter showing a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty miles an hour the Le Pere sped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the trail. It took less than fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes to reach the three speeding auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobiles that held the sheriff and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">deputies. The Le Pere turned around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flew straight for a moment, and then banked</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeply to the right. It was the agreed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon signal to indicate which road the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandits had taken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flyers wasted no time, but went swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly back on their way. They found the car</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding along the road, plainly making</seg><seg type="columnLine">every effort to get where they were going as</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast as might be practicable. The Le Pere</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed it five hundred feet high, and flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">on ahead. The next town was fifteen miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the road, and was only a hamlet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were perhaps five miles ahead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car when they struck a very large cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot, extending at least three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riding Herd-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">yards on each side of the road. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corn-stubble field, mowed closely, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what looked to be a partially broken-down</seg><seg type="columnLine">shack was in one corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gib shook Sleepy energetically, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed down. He motioned to it with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle. Sleepy nodded, his eyes glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the drooping lids and his face all</seg><seg type="columnLine">a-grin at what he conceived to be Gib's idea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He dipped over the field, ascertaining that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the furrows were shallow and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubble was very short, and then circled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back a few hundred yards for his landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was plenty of room, but he stalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down across the mesquite and landed, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing space enough for a take-off from where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plane stopped. Gib had unfastened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt before the plane stopped, and was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a flash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can get up there behind a tree or some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, and pop their front tires," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, his freckled face ablaze with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you shoot that well?" enquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleepy doubtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Born and brought up in Texas, boy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated Saunders. "You take off and keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">in touch with the posse. I could get every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them from behind my tree if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to rush me when I put their car out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of commission. If you stay here the plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">will warn them before they get near enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me. They could scatter in the mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite then and make the deal a lot more</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleepy nodded his acquiescence, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved on the throttle without delay.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was plenty of room, and he cleared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mesquite on the other side without</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. Below him he watched Gib's</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat stout form scurry across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field and dive into the woods at the farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He kept the Le Pere circling above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field at about five hundred feet, waiting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what would happen. He took time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look over his instruments closely. The oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure had dropped to twenty-two--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil had not been renewed since leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donovan. However, that was all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Sleepy knew the Liberty was good for</seg><seg type="columnLine">another two hours of flying on the oil sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply. Air pressure was correct at three, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tachometer showed the motor turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good fifteen-fifty. Centigrade tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture was 87° --too hot, due to the low flying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleepy throttled the motor to fourteen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■Modern Style	149</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred--as low as would keep the Le Pere</seg><seg type="columnLine">level--and opened the motor shutters the</seg><seg type="columnLine">final notch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment he saw the car approaching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">going like mad. He tilted up his ship in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallow bank, his eyes on the ground below</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The car was a quarter of the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the big clearing when he saw it lurch</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly. A hundred yards more and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped on the edge of the ditch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleepy grinned slowly. Apparently Gib</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strictly on the job. He saw flashes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame as the bandits returned the fire, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no answering shot from the woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as he could see. Undoubtedly Gib</seg><seg type="columnLine">was holding his fire for fear of hitting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four men clustered behind the car.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Evidently Mr. Saunders was not there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wondered where the banker was. Pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly they had bound and gagged him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some nook of his own house, he reflected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly his eyes narrowed and the wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth tightened. The four men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a break for the woods on the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite side of the clearing from where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saunders was hiding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a flash he saw the fatal mistake he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gib had made. By running on a course</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was a continuation of an imaginary</seg><seg type="columnLine">line made by Saunders and the car, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could use the car as a partial screen all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. When they reached the woods they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could circle around, using the trees as pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tection, and shoot Gib from the rear. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be totally helpless against four men</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread out in the woods behind him. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">only chance for escape, and that a slim one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to change their tires without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">under fire. In all probability they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate enough to take any chance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered even the slimmest of opportunities</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALMOST before these thoughts had</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced through Sleepy's head he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosed his ship down in a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">dive, motor wide open. The bandits were</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than fifty yards from the car as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came roaring across the field, not a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the ground, and headed straight for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Le Pere was a thing of terrible power</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it hurled itself across the ground, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandits turned and ran back toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car. The purpose of the pilot was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident to them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">150</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a grin Sleepy thanked his stars that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did not know how fatal it would be to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him if he really hit them. It would assuredly</seg><seg type="columnLine">break his propeller and pile him up against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees at the edge of the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No sooner had he gone past them than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his ship in a beautiful climbing turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was almost a wing-turn. The ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was practically stalled at the peak of it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed back the way it had just come. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled earthward, picking up speed as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped until it was once more speeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ground, nearer the car this time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bandits had stopped when it went past,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as it returned they scurried the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way back to the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once again Sleepy performed the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuver. If there was any flyer at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donovan Field who doubted Spears' flying-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability, a grand-stand seat that day would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have settled his doubts. Wing-turning a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Le Pere from a foot off the ground is a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neuver that leaves the pilot only a few feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">between himself and a bad crash. Stalling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest bit too much at the top of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing turn would mean a straight drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground, for there was not altitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to gain flying speed after it was once</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely lost. At best it was necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost to pick the ship off the ground as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled after the turn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice more they tried to make a run for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The second time one man flopped face</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the ground. Like a flash Sleepy</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosed down a bit more, trying to hit him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the wheels. In all probability it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hurt him badly, but it would certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">scare him effectually. His idea was simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bounce his wheels off the man's back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not succeed, but with a grin he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflected that he had not come far away, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man's body had disappeared beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wing. The man started to get up as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleepy passed, to be knocked down by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">propeller blast. He dived for the car with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out delay, and for ten minutes there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">further attempt at making the woods. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked very peaceful down there--the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching big and smooth in the sunlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">four men clustered quietly around the car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the mesquite giving no sign of the dead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly rifleman within its cool-looking green</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the bandits showed himself in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously beside the car. As Sleepy</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchfully patrolled low over the mesquite</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the man grab his arm and leap back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the shelter of the auto. A thin wisp</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke arose from the mesquite. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky that the bandits apparently had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolvers as weapons, thought the pilot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he nosed down at full throttle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All four men were making another attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cross the clearing. For a moment he lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of them as the top wing hid them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steepness of the dive. As he roared</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ground they retreated near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car, and flashes of fire from four revolvers</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen plainly. They shot continu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he passed them he felt a shattering .</seg><seg type="columnLine">impact in his shoulder. The plane wabbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment and veered perilously as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot felt the searing pain of the bullet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With an effort that left him faint he</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened the ship as the wing-skid</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged the ground, and held it level for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. He lifted it over the trees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">banked around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lucky shot had left his right arm al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most paralyzed. Every bump that hit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship caused him excruciating pain. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only one hand to handle both stick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">throttle. The blood was slowly staining</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his shirt, and he could feel it trick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling down his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three times more, at intervals of a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments, the men below tried to outwit</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Each time the roaring Le Pere, speed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward them as they started, sent them</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. Apparently they had no doubt of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot's intention to hit them. With his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">white under the tan, and his body weaken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rapidly as the slowly gushing blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">drained it of strength, Sleepy fought to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of all the tragedies that happen in flying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety per cent, start within ten feet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. An errot in leveling off--hitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">an obstruction in landing--slipping into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground trying to bank too close to it--those</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the things that kill pilots. Spears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcing himself to keep clear-headed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious by main force of will, time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">time again wing-turned off the ground to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush back across the field before his prey</seg><seg type="columnLine">could escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never a time did that terrific dive last a</seg><seg type="columnLine">split-second too long and send the Le Pere</seg><seg type="columnLine">head-on into the earth, nor did it falter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop as it climbed and turned together, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be ready for the next dive. Twice he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately tried to move his right arm, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the agony of it would help him fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Riding Herd--Modern Style</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">151</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">off the faintness that threatened to master</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no conception of the passage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. The motor was running wide open--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was too close to the ground to risk taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">his one good hand from the stick to cut it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A seductively dangerous languor came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him. It seemed useless to keep watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the men below--they had not made an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to break for the woods in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. It was so silly and futile to go to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He banked mechanically. For a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand dropped from the stick limply, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship nosed up; hovered on the verge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spin. A terrific bump that sent agonies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pain shooting through his right side</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared his head, and he caught the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">just in time.	^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The field danced crazily before his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew he must go down, or in a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he would cease to fight off the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licious drowsiness that seemed like paradise</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he thought of yielding to it.

He jerked the throttle</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, and quickly grabbed the control again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt a shock as the undercarriage swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the top of a tree. As if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching some one else do it he uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciously leveled off, five feet off the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The nose dropped, and the wheels hit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounced.

He was in bed, and evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a private house. An electric fan buzzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wall, and the setting sun sent a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams of light beneath the lowered cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains. A gray-headed man was smoking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigaret as he sat on the edge of a table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the boy," grinned the bald-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed man, ruffling the thin fringe of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair that he possessed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where might I be?" inquired Spears</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt the bandages on his arm, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious of utter weakness that was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My name is Saunders, and this is Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">White.

Something half re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed, half shadow, half seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half guessed. And it had not been there</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few seconds before. Being in England, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of pheasant worship and the grouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult, the shadow ought to have been a dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a fox--but it was not. It looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither of these, there was something differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent about it, a suggestion of greater wild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. It was a little larger than a fox, a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller than a wolf; and when it turned its</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes shone green. Then it stepped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full light, and became a coyote--a prairie</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reason for so fierce a presence in so</seg><seg type="columnLine">tame a land came about as follows. Four</seg><seg type="columnLine">months before, this coyote had struck a trap</seg><seg type="columnLine">in America--on the south fork of the Stink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Water River, to be exact. One month</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">before he was touring England as part of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling menagerie. Upon this night of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights he had been fed by his keeper--who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beautifully and unashamedly drunk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They found the man asleep in the cage</seg><seg type="columnLine">next morning; the key of the cage they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found on the floor, but the coyote they</seg><seg type="columnLine">never found. So much of this animal's</seg><seg type="columnLine">history is known, so much is public prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erty. The rest, that which follows, is here</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed for the first time. It was told to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me by the wild folk, and it is not given to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand the language of the wild folk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A thin high scream cut aslant the cathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dral silence of the pinewood, a scream al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most startlingly like that of a child, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coyote 'froze'. He sank upon the grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was still; eyes gleaming, ears pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">close back, thin lean upper lip lifted a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">to display the cruel glistening fangs. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">his flanks moved, still heaving to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Outcast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">153</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">exertions of his ten mile removal from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">menagerie. Then quite suddenly, came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream again, and the coyote slid away on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He knew that cry, the last protest against</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate of a terrified rabbit. He came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedge, and peered through. He saw a shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">owy beast with a big bush-tail--something</seg><seg type="columnLine">like his own--dragging a kicking rabbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the hedge. Red fox the coyote</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted to himself--and waited. By which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be seen that he knew all about foxes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reynard came on--knowing nothing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his turn of coyotes--and slid into the hedge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditch with his struggling prey. He preferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill it here than in the open, where its</seg><seg type="columnLine">pestilential squeal might attract any horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a keeper for instance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "G-r-r-r", said the coyote, a yard above</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in the tangle of hedge-roots and the fox</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffened from head to foot. He was fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened, that fox, frightened no end, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never heard a growl like that before in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his marauding life. And a stoat, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enviously watching the fox, fell back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward down the bank of the ditch and fled;</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a dry, rustling flutter o'erhead told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the roosting birds had heard that</seg><seg type="columnLine">growl also, and were afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A head--almost wolf-like in its evil fierce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, almost fox-like in its leering cunning--</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thrust suddenly from out the matted</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle, and the fox visibly quailed. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the head, came the coyote; not</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly but like a brown streak. The fox</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aware of a burning pain in his near</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, and he pivoted cringing back</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the damp dead leaves of the ditch--</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetting the rabbit. The rabbit had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten him, however. It forgot nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It went, or rather to be more exact, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, for noi|e had seen the going of it. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild it is as well to grab your chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">while you can; you may not get another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rabbit must have known. But if that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit thought--do rabbits think?--he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">check-mated his foes, he counted without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coyote. Check it may have been, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate was not yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a second the fox--badly bitten as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was--had picked up himself and also the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit's trail. Whereupon he went, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out comment, into the moonlit haze; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon, as he galloped, the rabbit danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. He could see it a fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow, a bunched up ball and a stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out streak alternately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bunny had no illusions. The drumming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the four-footed death on the short grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind left no room for any. He wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get back to the warren, which was not far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, very badly indeed. He would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">got there,'if a strange thing had not hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened--a thing neither hunter nor hunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The fox was first of all aware of it, a long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean, silent, gray shadow which shot--it</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost seemed to fly so quick was it--past</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to him.- It had eyes aflame, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, and he shied at sight of it, as a fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened horse shies. In a flash it was ahead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rabbit may have heard it coming; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is doubtful if he knew what killed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Followed a glint of fangs as the apparition</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot up alongside the luckless bunny, a snap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no pause. At full gallop this ghostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">specter had killed and picked up the quarry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung round in a wide circle, and vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, still going like the wind, into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Then at last the fox must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">realised that this was his new enemy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditch, the coyote, that strange, giant, foxy</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparition which had come out of nowhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him, and gone again as a whirlwind</seg><seg type="columnLine">might into nowhere, for aught he knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having dined, the coyote set off across</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, at the long, tireless, wolf gallop</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will run down almost any four-footed</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the end. He had no idea how far</seg><seg type="columnLine">that menagerie might pursue him, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taking no chances. A wild creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">never willingly takes chances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once--that was when he bee-lined over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bare blunt-nosed hill--a line of hurdles</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped up in front of him. He took them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his stride and fell among ewes, many and</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud voiced ewes, who rose up as one sheep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran about complaining in a full throated</seg><seg type="columnLine">chorus. Seeing that the poor outcast's one</seg><seg type="columnLine">notion at that time--possibly at all times--</seg><seg type="columnLine">was self-effacement, this action on the ewes'</seg><seg type="columnLine">part was unkind. For one thing it caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to fly the opposite line of hurdles like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bird, and for another it awoke a long, low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue beast, from nowhere special, which fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dumbly at the coyote's heels. The shep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd called it a bob-tailed sheep-dog, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it looked more like a silent devil in the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the "cynical moon." It took the coyote</seg><seg type="columnLine">half an hour to shake that speechless horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his track.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once also--that was when he was gingerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding the corner of a cattle-muddied</seg><seg type="columnLine">gateway--he fell on to and over a warm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feathery live thing, which got up and snored</seg><seg type="columnLine">away into the night on vast flapping wings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more uncannily than any ghost. The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred yards he must have covered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">record time for he was scared almost into</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabies. The thing was an owl, a white owl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a big one at that, though what it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing in the mud of a gateway no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows. Perhaps some rat could have told.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rats are generally intimately--too inti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mately for their liking--connected with'the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doings of owls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And once--that was the worst fright of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all--he barged head over heels into some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that he could not see stretched across</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gap, and it clung. He fought madly for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a space, rolling about, snapping, and tear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like a thing possessed, for this nightmare</seg><seg type="columnLine">held on all round him. Followed a curse</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shadows, and after the curse a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and after the man a dog--a thin, lean</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog this time. The coyote did not like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of that dog, it looked under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and even a mole could see that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">built for speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This may explain, perhaps, why he bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man on the hand--his teeth met, I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">told--and went away into the night with half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unseen terror which clung, wildly flap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping from his hind quarters. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">swore strange oaths and went away in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry, which seemed strange. As a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fact, however, the coyote had run into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a poacher's net stretched across a gap-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the entertainment of certain hares, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poacher was about as scared as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie-wolf over the meeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour later came the dawn--cold, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitying, matter-of-fact dawn---and it dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered this coyote in the middle of a gorse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-bog-patched moor. He went into re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirement for the day in a fox's earth which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sought and found in a great hurry. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stench of the place--for there are few</seg><seg type="columnLine">fouler abodes among the wild folk than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">den of the little red rascal--made him very</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally, and shamelessly, ill. He knew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that anything--even the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">appalling effluvium--is better than for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night prowlers, the outlaws, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found abroad when the sun is up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN evening fell, and the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows hunted the raw, red sun home</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his lair, the coyote thrust out an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiring muzzle, and thrust it back again</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hurry. A man was coming through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gorse--a jet black shadow carved out, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, against the crimson sky. Came he to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fox's earth and dropped a rabbit by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance. He gave no reason for so strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">an action, but the reason--seven of them--</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been found killed in his fowl-house</seg><seg type="columnLine">three nights before--and the rabbit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisoned. Evidently this tit-bit, this gift</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratis, was intended for the entertainment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rightful owner of that den, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to be away upon a blood raid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the opposite direction!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The coyote waited ten minutes after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had gone, then he wriggled out to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit. He gave one sniff, only one, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went away, also, straight as a die, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">very swiftly, with every hair along his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting up all bristly. You see, he was ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted with poison. He had cause to be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he had once on a time watched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother die beside a poisoned carcass, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terror of the taint which had hung in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air round that carcass lived with him ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">after. It had been a nightmare, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere whiff of poison a hundred yards to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leeward, had the effect of terrifying him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a hunted cat, this wolfish beast, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not a wolf, panicked across the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sullen moor. Then he caught sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own shadow cast by the dying sun--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blue figure against blood red grass--danc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing along at his side. He never waited to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, but shot away ten yards in three</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounds--and stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no question about the stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping. One moment he was racing at I dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">not say what speed, the next he just--wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving. And the suddenness of it nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenched him to pieces.

In the pine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood behind him--such was the silence--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coyote could hear the hollow purr of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air in the upper branches, like the humming</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a shell, and the tiny tumult of an ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">city: the indescribable slithering undersound</seg><seg type="columnLine">which can only be detected in very still</seg><seg type="columnLine">places. Night was stalking westward swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the purple lakes of heather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A jay screeched 'gratingly, somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">'way back in the wood; the last woodpecker</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fled laughing into the shadows; the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">family of titmice had trailed by, twittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">and "twee-jeeing" to each other, through this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall of a thousand columns. Presently came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long-drawn sigh echoing down the pillared</seg><seg type="columnLine">aisles, and after the. sigh a big brown bird,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flapping like some gigantic moth; that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long-horned owl, and it flew without sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an owl should.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the coyote turned his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something--some swift moving shadow--</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming across the bog. How any beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavier than a mouse could cross that quak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing abomination was past understanding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the shadow proceeded leisurely and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flustered enough, and it did not sink. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly the coyote, the outcast, slid to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heather patch on his belly, and lay there</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched; his green glazed eyes fixed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at the shadow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The apparition came on, bounding lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from tussock to tussock of deer-grass, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">insolently, half playfully, it seemed toying</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the suffocating death that it only es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caped by a hair's breadth at each fairy-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The coyote's lips dripped, as he watched;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes took on a crueler glow. The thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a deer, he knew the breed: the slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, the arched hind-quarters, the graceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">step, as if the beast were walking on air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a matter of fact she--it was a she--was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roe-deer but this he did not know. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took her for a prong-horn antelope, perhaps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a white-tail deer--but, no matter; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tactics would be the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She passed him--he had taken care to lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">well to leeward--quite close, so close that</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she vanished like some spirit of the wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the trees, he saw the transient</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of her white rump quite plainly. For</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute he waited--time enough for her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrate the wood well out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he dropped his head, and, with tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly lifted, settled into the long easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolf-gallop on her trail. He must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known by the scent how close he was--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">how far--for never once did he sight her or</seg><seg type="columnLine">blunder on to her heels in the pine gloom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor was she once startled, or aware of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracker. Thus nicely did he judge his pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the trail broke from the wood and led,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight now as a die over the open moor, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace increased. The lone night wind whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered in his ears, and the night-hawks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bats did their own small hunting above him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he never lifted his head. His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">glued on the way ahead. Only his restless</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears took note of that which went on around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once a fox halted in the middle of trailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rabbit, to stare at this big wolfish beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">loping by with gleaming eyes; and once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, which was not a fox--though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as big--stood in his path chattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscenely, forcing him to go round. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been a badger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally--this after an exhibition of clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">windings, twists and turns--the trail led</seg><seg type="columnLine">to,a spruce firwood, black as a well, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still as a well, or death. Here was needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">great caution, and the coyote slid belly flat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The whorls of the trees came down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed the needle-carpeted ground, diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult to avoid, hard even to creep through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard that is, when even the faint sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed back branches, would have ruined</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in that desert-like silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, as if some cold hand had seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, the coyote sank where he stood, sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was still, like one that is stricken sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly by death. In front was a clearing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than a gap, shadowed as to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">center by one lone, big spruce fir. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath that lonely shade stood the doe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she had business with something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there. She was anxious, that deer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious and happy, making odd little noises</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her throat--and beside her were two</seg><seg type="columnLine">more shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she stood out before the moon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there followed her, two fawns, their great</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful eyes shining like stars.

Followed her to the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wood, far enough to see the roe-deer</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely on her way--but no farther. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">other work on hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In five minutes he was back again by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miniature clearing, crouching motionless as</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, watching always the gloom beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spruce that stood aloof. And the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">paled to gray even as he crouched. So in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently were his cruel eyes fixed upon this</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot that he never saw a shadow--surely it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no more than a shadow--which drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from nowhere special behind him--</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted and stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The minutes dragged on painfully, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the dead silence, the stagnant air, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for something to happen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FOX passed, slinking and car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine tinted about the jaws. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">pine-marten "rippling in faultless</seg><seg type="columnLine">curves," the incarnation of living, moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">grace, went by in the dawn, and his jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">also bore the blood stain, the badge of out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawry. A squirrel slid down perkily from</seg><seg type="columnLine">some tree near at hand, and slid up again</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a hurry, when it saw the couched coyote.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fox was red, the pine-marten was red,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the squirrel was red, the watching, waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow behind was red, all of them red,</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a background of reddish tree-trunks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pine-needles, lighted up all together</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suddenly by the fiery red of dawn, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful dawn which comes after the gray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and is followed again by a day of gray rain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the coyote moved, sat up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow--the shadow was gone. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gleam as of twin stars, a flash as of a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning lamp, hastily extinguished, marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">its disappearance, and made one half suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious as to whether it had really been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow after all, and half doubtful as to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever having been there at all. This also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coyote did not see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the wolfish beast moved forward--</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost flat he proceeded---and his caution</seg><seg type="columnLine">was evident at every careful, creeping stride.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was still darkness under the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">spruce, and for a moment he stood con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusedly. Then, in a soft place, just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least noticeable spot, exactly where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be most difficult to get at, he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fawns. They were lying down, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep; they were looking not at him but</seg><seg type="columnLine">past him, behind him at something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there--the shadow had come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A gleam of white fangs scintillated in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing light, but there was no sound as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coyote half rose and dived forward headlong</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the helpless fawns. They tumbled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet. They could run fairly well, fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to avoid a man, but not a coyote.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And they fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, without any kind of warning at all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow took unto itself life. It hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself forward head down, preceded by short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but rapier-sharp horns, at the speed of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerfully shot arrow; and its mark, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">goal, appeared to be the coyote. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">full-grown roe-buck, and of all the cloven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoofed ones the roe-buck is the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled with fear and flurry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The coyote was behind one of the fawns--</seg><seg type="columnLine">just about to deliver one of his quick, chop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping bites on the flank, in fact--when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">became aware of a small-sized whirlwind</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling down upon him from behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He realized his danger, and pivoted upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, presenting a fanged and snarling</seg><seg type="columnLine">front in one and the same second, so it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed; being specially designed to do so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in the next second he was removed quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve feet by the sharpest pair of horns, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most impetuous buck, he had ever run</seg><seg type="columnLine">up against. When he regained his feet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was practically the same moment as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he touched the ground--he was furious;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this buck was only small--no larger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pronghorn antelope, and the wound in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder pained abominably. But he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made one blunder; he had not reckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Outcast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">157</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the peculiar character of the roe-buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">--there are deer and deer, and the roe-deer</seg><seg type="columnLine">is unique.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next moment the whirlwind was upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him again; the fury of the charge was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traordinary, and amazed the half-recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">coyote. He did not--being only an outcast</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolfling--stand up to it, but skipped to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, and delivered one of his chopping flank</seg><seg type="columnLine">bites. A whirl of pine-needles followed, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roe-buck can turn as can no other deer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the coyote fell backward, as the quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est way to avoid a hissing slash of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible forked little horns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thereafter things happened, and hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened quickly. The coyote was no amateur</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the matter of keeping a whole skin by</seg><seg type="columnLine">agility, and agility alone, but the deer he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew were not like unto this little fury. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped, and side-leaped and sprung back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, pivoted on his tracks, spun like a top,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled from under the flying hoofs, raced like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a greyhound, and generally performed on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">average thirty acrobatic feats a minute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His foe, however, plunged and stabbed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabbed and hacked, stamped and tore, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raged, and fumed, and bucked, and backed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thrust, and cut, and slashed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">foamed, like unto some four-footed fiend.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The coyote might have been a magnet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buck a piece of steel, so close did they</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow one another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now a coyote, unharried and unpressed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is many kinds of a coward, but a coyote</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered and hanging on to his life by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskers, is just any sort of a devil you like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to name. This may be why, at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes of this death dance, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">triangular gaps on the roe-buck--chiefly</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the flanks--where the flesh had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">removed in chunks. On the other hand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coyote was striped much as is a tiger; only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stripes were red, not black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Followed a collision.

It was a bundle, that is all</seg><seg type="columnLine">you could say; a huddle, and it was not nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">to behold. The needles flew all whither,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the earth followed suit. Which beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">was where, it was impossible to say. Save</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the horrible low and continuous snarling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the coyote, there was no sound, but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that death hovered round that jumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">of legs and bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, with startling suddenness it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased--the fight was over.

Tripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly over the high door-sill, the parson-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like steward gave vent to what sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspiciously like a real, ripping, back-o'-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond curse and then abruptly resumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his solemn aspect and gait and proceeded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the galley. But the surprize came when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cook, the big, Herculean cook, got up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own door-sill with amazing alacrity at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharply flung word from the steward, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the dish from him with the air of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">subdued underling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the moment the chief mate, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the tug's line let-go, was passing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">superintend the making of more sail, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steward turned aft again and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">collided with him. There was a very sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dued exchange of words; even the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate could detect that, since he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching keenly. Then the mate loudly</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned the steward to look where he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going in future, and they separated, each to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his job. Then the cook's grotesque visage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thrust out of the door, and for five</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds he regarded the pair of receding</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs with a gaze of such bitter intensity</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Mr. Tudgay involuntarily turned away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shiver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The incident might have suggested a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery to any one except a buoyant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">youthful second mate scarcely out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, to whom the world was a round ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in such fashion that good square-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigger sailors might be developed on out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-home voyages to the colonies, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">constituted a circumnavigation of the globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">every time. As it was, Tudgay was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more concerned in thinking what the luck</seg><seg type="columnLine">of watch-picking would bring him out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightful mob of incompetents struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with uncertain hands and feet at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appalling task of putting sail on a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">clipper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE of Captain Kirk's good habits</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the holding of deck church</seg><seg type="columnLine">every Sunday forenoon, and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps it was all the better as a habit inas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as his ship always carried a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of boys out of decent homes. With Sunday</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">arriving, and his ship stretching away on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">composite Great-Circle track for the Horn;</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hulking, scowling, incapable crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least hammered into some sort of shape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ship's business going on with more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less smoothness through sheer capacity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself and mates; Captain Kirk set the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys to work laying out reading-desk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">books on the poop, and cast speculative</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes upon the parson-like steward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Skeets, ye look as if some time ye had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught Sunday-school," he said.

But since there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no substitute, Captain Kirk would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit service to be delayed; the skipper</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up his place at the desk himself, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">break of the poop where all hands could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear, and bade the mate muster the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">aft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men came dubiously. Only half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour before they had all been turned out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a Sunday morning top, to brace up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards a trifle, and were sullen about it; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were enough among them who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made at least one voyage who knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">immemorial custom at sea gave Sunday to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew. And but for crass stupidity they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have enjoyed the rest, too, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for standing wheel in turn, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather was fine even if the wind had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet settled down true. They came and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood beside the mizzen hatch, sullen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttering, while the captain opened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">book and began to read service.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Midway to the end, the wind came ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and without stopping longer than to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give the order, the skipper sent both mates</seg><seg type="columnLine">with half the men--those whose regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch on deck it was--to trace the yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp up. Even while Mr. Tudgay howled</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauling chanteys in the waist to encourage</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Cook of the Yallaroi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">161</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the men, the service droned along its inevit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able course; and never once did Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk seem to take his eyes from his prayer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">book. But he was the shipmaster even</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he played parson, and the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">service was more than a little broken in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As it was in the beginning-- That'll do</seg><seg type="columnLine">th' foreyard!-- Is now and ever shall be--</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Vast hauling that!-- World without end--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well th' mainyard, Mr. Tudgay!-- Amen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Turn to, ye useless lumps, and coil up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gear!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The skipper finished, flung his book down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stamped the poop, cursing to high</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heaven the fate which had sent him such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a double-left-legged lot of sons of blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailors for crew, and audibly wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">what sort of mates he had inherited that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could not lick a crew into shape in</seg><seg type="columnLine">three days at sea. Perhaps the crux of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter was overheard by the second mate</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the pantry skylight after he had resumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of the deck and captain and mate had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone below to prepare for the noon observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

Youthful as he was, yet his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea time had been spent during a period</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it was nothing unusual for a sailing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship to change crews three or four times in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a round voyage; and in Australia, New Zea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land or the West Coast there werS strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters always ready to take the places</seg><seg type="columnLine">of deserting crews, and that with the sole</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of getting as far and as fast away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their shipping port as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Runaway convicts, weary of chain-gangs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and breakwater slavery; unfrocked priests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond shame at their fall; deserting sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diers, defaulting, smug crooks from places</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trust, and sheer crooks--all these went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make up crews of those glorious old clip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers that gave all the romance and spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the glorious old sea. Mr. Tudgay had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen every type, and though he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced any deeper trouble from such</seg><seg type="columnLine">crews than apprehension, he was still young</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Cook of the Yallaroi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to retain a sacred belief that one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">big trouble must burst right under his nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he was certain that the trouble-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laden voyage had come. He disliked many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crew; he distrusted the parsonlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">steward, and through him the too friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief mate; he wasn't sure about the alarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly ugly cook, but had been inclined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the man, especially so since receiving</seg><seg type="columnLine">that steaming dish of Scotch collops, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoon of which he was even now licking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But since devouring the savory mess he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun to think deeply, and now he recalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amazing subsidence of the powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">cook at a single word from the sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">different steward; he recalled with growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment the boy's report of that gor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geous forecastle fight, in which the quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly built seaman who was a friend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cook's had whipped the toughest-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">bully in the gang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The threat of the cook to scrag the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make stew of him was lost in the newer</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzle of the skipper. Captain Kirk had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never failed to show a subtle power in deal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with refractory crews before; but here</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the one time when he apparently fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">down hard, for Tudgay could attribute his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own temporary disgrace to no other source</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the mental aberration of the Old Man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lighted a pipe, turned into his bunk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to thresh out the whole matter in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peaceful solitude of his snug prison. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">found his tobacco unaccountably difficult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep alight; he lighted the pipe a half-dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, then concluded that there was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing amiss more than damp weed, for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe was cold the last time he put match to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, though he was convinced that the five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes' strenuous drawing at it following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the previous ignition must have made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl hot-- Then the poop bell struck four</seg><seg type="columnLine">bells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me sleeping like that?" he growled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slung his legs over the lee-board, rubbing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes foolishly and trying to remember any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing queer in the taste of those collops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing that any man could have said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at that moment could have altered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion that he had been drugged. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer sleepiness could make him fall asleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">was absurd, to him. He was still puzzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a yell pealed up on deck that brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the floor and at the cabin door in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fire!" arose the yell.

Up wi' ye, man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tudgay went, choking back the hot re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tort that rose to his lips, and found the ship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">company milling in a strange sort of frenzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the poop ladders, while the mate, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">two sleepy boys beside him, bore himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">more like a liner captain at a fake fire-drill</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a swagger passenger steamer than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate of a prosaic old butter-and-mutton</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon caught on fire in the wastes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extreme South Pacific.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Kirk went past the chartroom on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way to take charge, and glanced at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's last position as pricked off. The run</seg><seg type="columnLine">since previous noon brought her within reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Bounty group of islands and rocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He joined the mate at the poop rail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What ha'ye done?

For a moment he lost sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sound of the crew, failed to catch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominous note in their deep mutterings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove with all his faculties to put a name to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amazing aroma carried by the swirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke. Tinned mutton and tub butter</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone make a cargo hard to set fire to; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">butter might make a blazing inferno of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire when started, but neither it nor the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canned meat would be likely to catch fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">without strong inducement from outside;</seg><seg type="columnLine">besides, that puzzling reek was more remi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">niscent of very boyish days than of a grave</seg><seg type="columnLine">164</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">marine disaster.

A ripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">oath escaped him, and he cursed his helms-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and the men on the poop luridly for</seg><seg type="columnLine">failing to detect and account for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">refugees before.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">cook produced his cleaver, suspiciously dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to blade, and spat on his hands; but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face grew stony as he noticed that his was</seg><seg type="columnLine">170</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the only weapon. The sight of it, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">protruded over every edge of the top in</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn, caused the four climbers to be wary</seg><seg type="columnLine">before setting foot on those overhanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">futtock-ratlines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on!" roared Galway savagely.

But the men on the other side had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the opening; one darted upward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached over, and grabbed one of the boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the leg, wringing a cry of terror from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad. Like a big ape the cook twisted around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung himself full length across the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, and brought down the cleaver upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outstretched arm. Hand and forearm</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted from the rest at the elbow, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man fell headlong to the deck below, show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering those in the top with spurting drops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Galway roared, but the man's shriek</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned his roar. On the other side again</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men made an infuriated rush, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cook saw the hopelessness of it all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up, Tom!" he gritted, darting from side</seg><seg type="columnLine">to side with chopping blows. "Up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you by the main-t'-gallant-stay! Up, boys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him. Can ye climb, sonny?" he asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pausing a second to place his hand gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the bowed head of the younger boy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure ye can, laddie! Up wi' you all now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if ye make it we have them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One by one the boys swarmed aloft on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay, Tom taking last place instead of first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and immediately under the trembling boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in case he needed a cheering word or a help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing hand. The cook kept the top inviolate</seg><seg type="columnLine">through sheer animal tirelessness and agili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty, until the attackers drew back for breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No man can hang indefinitely to futtock</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigging and fight with one hand. Glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloft, the cook saw Tom reach the topgallant</seg><seg type="columnLine">masthead and make the boys secure; then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering over the edge of the top to be sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his distance, he slung his cleaver to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck with a rope-yarn stop cut from a coil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small rigging and swarmed up the stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">after his fellows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now if they follow up the stay I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">chop down a bloomin' army!" panted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cook, unslinging his fearsome weapon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Galway was watching, and as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the first man crossed the foretop and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped the stay to swarm to the mainmast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice rose in a savage bellow:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come down, you blasted lunatic! All of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you come down, and get after 'em by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main rigging."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One man remained on deck by the fore</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrouds, to guard against swift descent;</seg><seg type="columnLine">another stood by the main, and Galway</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself watched the mizzen; then every</seg><seg type="columnLine">available mutineer swarmed aloft on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main, determined to overwhelm that little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch of clinging figures high up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender topgallantmast. And a new influ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence entered into the game; the parson-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">steward, Skeets, emerged from the cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, glanced over the ship, and spoke in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp tone to Galway, who glared fiercely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but made no retort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come down, all but two of you!" yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steward, who had apparently assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">command.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men climbing, almost under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main-top, paused.

I'm glad. I can't see my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to any other course in the case of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular magazine and, on the other hand,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't like to follow any course to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the majority of you are opposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I forgot to cover one point. Two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you raise this point vehemently in letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me and they are, I think, quite right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dashes for cusswords, yes, but when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes to dashes for "God," "hell," "devil,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">etc., used, not as cusswords, but in a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly legitimate way, there's no need of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashes. Yet our magazine has, on various</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasions, used them in such cases. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of the dash is as offensive to me as it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to any of the rest of you. I'm "agin' " it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and always have been. But there are seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us on the staff and, while most of us have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been here for years, there are changes now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then. As there are a few thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">other things to watch out for, this distinc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in the use of dashes isn't always fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed or even clearly seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">173</seg><seg type="columnLine">174</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For that matter, it's often hard to draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line. Those of you who have read proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that "style and consistency" are often</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to maintain. On one side the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll get a series of cases, each case lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing logically on to the next, demanding for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it the same treatment, and all of a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll find you've crossed the line--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">done it logically too. Or, stated the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, you'll put one case on one side the line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">later put a second case on the other side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then find there's no logical distinction</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We have lots of arguments on the staff</seg><seg type="columnLine">over cussword cases. When is a cussword</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cussword? Sounds easy to answer, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes we don't find it so. Also, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated already, sometimes we just make</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our intention is to use the word itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever it is not plainly a cussword as</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in that particular instance.

For all that I am of tender years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been with the most of those about this Fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what time they were in the far places of the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon their different occasions. He that went down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sea and reefed topsails in the gale and passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weather earing, I have been with him, albeit I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed in on the yard, in the bunt, and clung to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jack-stay with both hands, for which I was beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the ears by the second mate. He that hath</seg><seg type="columnLine">been to the Spanish Main, and on the beach thereof,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been with him, and have been cast out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">American consulate, whither I had gone for food,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my ear, and gone to the British, and been be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trayed by my accent, and then sought a missionary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and been given the grubstake that my own Govern-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ment had denied me.

Hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pital, huit chevaux, replacement camp, M.P.'s, ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck, vin ordinaire, submarines, I knew them all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From Mezy to Montfaucon I went, I and my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rades of the Rock of the Marne, with our battle cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">of "When do we eat?" on our lips. Two bites of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust I took, one at Mont St. Pere, and one in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Argonne, which last was near to being the death of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.

If our country and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">British Empire ever do go to war, I--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this magazine if I'm in charge--will do our</seg><seg type="columnLine">little best against them. I hope there</seg><seg type="columnLine">never is such a war--nor a war between us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and any other nation, and meanwhile I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">see no earthly reason for not being friendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Canadians with whom we've lived in</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace for over a hundred years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, in the magazine I've stood against</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts to breed ill feeling between Cana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dians and us.

Abraham was neither Jew nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Israelite. The Jews are descendants of the tribe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judah, who was Jacob's, that is to say, Israel's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth son. The English-speaking nations, together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Scandinavian, Saxon, Bavarian and certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">others are descendants of the other, so-called "lost,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten tribes, who were carried away into captivity</seg><seg type="columnLine">about 800 B. C. and settled in a country that came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be known as Scythia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those ten tribes never did get along well v:tli the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jews or Judah-ites, whom they despised and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">often at war with. The ten tribes included the tribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dan. The tribe of Dan had several character-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istics, one of which was that they were sea-farers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">another that they liked to leave their name wher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever they went, and a third that they were rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">more prone to piracy and raiding in general than</seg><seg type="columnLine">even any of the other rascals were who mr.de up that</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing group of mother-nations descended from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jacob's sons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"JpHE tribe of Dan had established colonies in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isles of the Seas long before the invasion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Canaan by the Assyrians. The Isles of the Seas</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Great Britain and Ireland. They are repeat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly referred to in Old Testament writings. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe of Dan's "long ships" used to sail there regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly. So did the ships of the Philistines, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">established rival colonies, worshiping Baal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">naming such places as Ballyshannon, which is Baal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shannon, after their horrible deity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heremon is a Hebrew-root word. The Heremon</seg><seg type="columnLine">who became king of Ireland and married Zedekiah's</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter, thus providing for the continuance of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">royal line of David in accordance with prophecy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was undoubtedly either an Israelite or descended</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an Israelite who emigrated in one of those long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the Assyrians carried off the ten tribes into</seg><seg type="columnLine">captivity they did not find them so easy to keep as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to capture. They refused to stay put. Their route</seg><seg type="columnLine">across Europe was blazed, and has continued blazed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by that enterprising tribe of Dan, who left their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribe name all over the place. There are scores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">instances: The rivers Don (Dan), "D(a)niester,</seg><seg type="columnLine">D(a)neever, Danube--Denmark, which is Dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark or the country of the Danes, or Dans---place-</seg><seg type="columnLine">names such as Danebrog.

As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to the genealogy of our Savior, as given by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luke, we find He was of the house of Nathan, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">son of David and jointly through Zorobabel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Son of Salathiel, of the line of Solomon, as written</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Matthew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS FOR the rulers of Great Britain descending</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the marriage of the daughter of Zede-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kiah to King Heremon of Ireland, through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence of Jeremiah, tradition says Jeremiah died</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Ireland.

A word from one of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">writers' brigade on this interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunt:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">San Francisco.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I've justfinished the June 10th Adventure, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">contains Mr. W. E. Besson's inquiry regardingethe</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous "rope trick" of the Indian jugglers. If a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dope drawn from memory and not capable of sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantiation at this time is admissable, I'll unburden</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chest of the account of my own encounter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this yarn:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">COME ten years ago I got hold of a book of travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">--one of Mayne Reid's, I think--in which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a description of the trick as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A fakir and a boy appeared in the streets of Cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutta (?) carrying a large covered basket. When a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd had gathered, the fakir produced from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basket a rope and a big knife. The rope he coiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heaved upward, and one end went out of sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stayed, while he held the "bitter end" in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy, at a signal from his master, climbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope hand-over-hand and disappeared. A few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments later the fakir called for the boy to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, but received no answer. He called several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times and at last, apparently irritated by the boy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, placed the knife between his teeth and him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self ascended the rope; disappeared. From above</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Camp-Fire	181</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came a blood-curdling yell, then in rapid sequence</seg><seg type="columnLine">the severed arms, legs, head of the boy hurtled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground, followed finally by the hacked trunk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fakir descended rapidly, his knife dripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood. He gathered together the pieces of the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">and placed them in the basket, covering it again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a mumbled incantation he opened the basket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out stepped the boy, unhurtl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "HAT'S the account I read--and wondered over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   But a little later--in the same year--I came</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a description of the trick in some magazine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It purported to be an expose of the trick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An Englishman, who had heard of the feat, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a dabbler in mesmerism and hypnotism, waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a fakir to appear. One came and the theater</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a street lined with blank walls--so that none</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the immediate assembly, which was to a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the fakir's, influence, might see(?)--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Englishman, with a camera, found a hole in the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the fakir. He took picture after picture and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the fakir had finished and gone, questioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many of the spectators as possible. Without ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception these described the performance much as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is described above.. But the pictures, covering</seg><seg type="columnLine">every moment of the performance, revealed only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd gaping fixedly upward, while the fakir</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his boy-assistant stood quietly by the basket on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mesmerism of the spectators en masse was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation advanced by the Englishman. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not susceptible to mesmeric influence, he stated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so was the only person to witness the performance</seg><seg type="columnLine">who "saw just what he saw" and not what the fakir</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him believe he saw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T WISH I had the names of the book and maga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zine from which the above are taken. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no reason at time of reading to think of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">point and I made no notes. But I'd be willing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take oath that I've given here the essence of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounts; they made a marked impression upon me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my memory, I'm told, is "inconveniently long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether or not the expose of the trick was au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thentic, I would like to learn. Perhaps both ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counts are mere travelers' tales on a par with Herod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">otus' account of the crocodiles' tears. sQuien sabe?</seg><seg type="columnLine">At any rate, I know that some where in the books is</seg><seg type="columnLine">mention of this particular trick and what I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely others of Camp-Fire saw also. Some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experts on mesmerism might also be able to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether or not such group-mesmerism is possible.--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eugene Cunningham.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YOU'LL remember I asked you for</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinions as to the "blurbs" following</seg><seg type="columnLine">titles on our contents pages and in "Trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ahead" when we began cutting out even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of the "ballyhoo" than formerly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quite a number of you responded and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">went over the "vote" carefully.

Pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terson, Fort Mills, Philippine Islands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Answer, by Mr. Goldie:--Stock-raising land in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Australia is usually divided into first, second, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">third class grades. As in all other new countries, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">richer soil was the first to be occupied and worked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage. In many districts it proved that only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first class would pay under the then existing cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstances; but as conditions impuved, second-</seg><seg type="columnLine">class country became as desirable as the first-class</seg><seg type="columnLine">had'originally been. Then the third-class came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupation, and in turn proved profitable because it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was secured at low values and had been brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">within easy communication with markets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the most closely settled States, such as Victoria</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tasmania, the greater extent of the land is held</seg><seg type="columnLine">under freehold, and the newcomer who desires to</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure property will find it best to buy an improved</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, or, better still, to purchase some good grazing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land which is still subject'to considerable improve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. If he has moderate means, the buyer can</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a fair profit on his capital, while he continues</seg><seg type="columnLine">to increase the value of his holding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well-fenced and watered sheep or cattle country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided with a homestead, may be bought in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">States at from 4 to 8 pounds per acre according to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">its carrying capacity; while properties in first-class</seg><seg type="columnLine">order and capable of grazing two sheep to the acre</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost considerably more. Usually these are compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively small, and. a good deal of cultivation is carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">on by the holders. It is on such places as these,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that a skilful stock-breeder may make</seg><seg type="columnLine">money and accumulate property.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like all good things, the best of the grazing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">estates in Tasmania and Victoria must be paid for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but once established and with the right class 6f</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock in the paddocks, the enterprising breeder from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old country soon makes good on his purchase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What can be accomplished on small sheep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holdings has been demonstrated by the merino</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep-breeders of midland Tasmania. Here many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old families have carried on flocks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finest merino for many years. They raise thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stud sheep and send them to the mainland for sale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Tasmanian sheep were introduced into hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of the largest flocks in the other States, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep-breeding in Australia owes much to the group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of accomplished breeders in the little island. Flocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one thousand to two thousand sheep, kept up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a high standard, have been sufficient to maintain</seg><seg type="columnLine">their owners in the position of small pastoral kings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In other parts of the island, splendid herds of cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been reared and maintained on small holdings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have kept prosperous families on the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In Victoria there is still some leased country, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are thousands of acres of grazing-land that</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer opportunities to the buyer who has pastoral</seg><seg type="columnLine">instincts, and prefers stock-keeping to the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">arduous agricultural operations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> North from Victoria, on the Murray River, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the southern pastoral districts of New South Wales,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great extent of sheep country stretches away west,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and east into the mountains, which stand back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coast. Throughout this wonderful stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pasturage there are great productive grazing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">properties which carry from one sheep to an acre to</seg><seg type="columnLine">three sheep to two acres. The newcomer, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for land, will find large estates varying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">value from 4 to 7 pounds per acre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Provided that he is in a position to finance the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purchase of land and stock, he can not fail with good</seg><seg type="columnLine">management to make any of these properties pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">very handsomely. There are also chances of secur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing land on lease from the Government, and others</seg><seg type="columnLine">of acquiring a partly improved portion of a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">run which is being cut up by the owners or subdi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided after resumption by the State.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stock-breeder from older countries finds con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions in Australia almost completely the reverse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those to which he has been accustomed. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals live in the open air in this wonderful climate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the year round. With the exception of certain stock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as special studs, working horses, and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "house" cows, all the animals feed solely on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet pastures of the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The newcomer wonders at what he considers to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insufficient steading about the country homes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Australia. It is soon explained to him that no build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings are needed for housing animals in the Winter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and this mainly accounts for the difference in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of a five-stock establishment in Australia and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in a cold country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As a matter of course, the working conditions also</seg><seg type="columnLine">differ to a considerable extent. Much less labor is</seg><seg type="columnLine">required to work the same number of cattle or sheep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most of the work is in the open paddocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A direct consequence of this is that one man can</seg><seg type="columnLine">i86</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">attend'to a large number of animals. There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">yearly operations, such as lamb-marking and shear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and cattle-mustering and branding, while in</seg><seg type="columnLine">between, the animals are worked from paddock to</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddock according to the condition of the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fats" come on much more irregularly than in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a country where hand feeding is universal, but stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatten very quickly on the rapid flushes of grass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">herbage which come in good seasons. The animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">make amazing progress from birth to maturity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless they get a very severe check. The system is</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus almost as simple as that on the cattle ranches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Texas and the Argentine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most stock-owners in Australia stock lightly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the variations in the seasons. As a rule,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the pastures are very good, the broad acres</seg><seg type="columnLine">could carry many more animals than are grazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them, but the long-headed stockmen are</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied to keep them in good condition, and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve the grass for recurring periods of dry weather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On his tours of inspection, which are usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary before he can settle down, the land-seeker</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquires a great deal of knowledge of the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is essential to his career as a pastoralist. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon learns to distinguish sheep from cattle country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and picks up many wrinkles on the management of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all classes of stock in Australia. Information on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">value of water conservation is impressed upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Except in Western Australia, where, on extensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">pastoral areas, scrub and small timber are necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">to augment the carrying capacity of the country, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sees the advantage gained by killing the exhausting</seg><seg type="columnLine">green timber and cleaning up the surface of the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the dry timber falls. The experienced Australian</seg><seg type="columnLine">pastoralist will take him in hand on train and</seg><seg type="columnLine">motorcar journeys, and freely impart to him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tips he has gained in years of pioneering in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having at last made his selection and secured his</seg><seg type="columnLine">property, which may be 2,000 or 10,000 acres in</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent according to his means, his ambitions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the class of country he prefers, his first year will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost solely devoted to making decisions as to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best means of working his place and of following such</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations as he can compass. If he has purchased</seg><seg type="columnLine">an improved property he will learn how to use the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddocks, water supply and other improvements on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best scheme for keeping his stock in condition.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a general rule, he will discover that to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best of his holding he needs to complete the'improve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Starting on an improved place; however, the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner has a great advantage in being able to work his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock to immediate profit. He can devote most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his time and his resources to the actual management</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his sheep or cattle, and the place begins to produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him from the jump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other hand, if he begins on partially im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved property, the principal improvement is likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be the killing of most of the timber and the erec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of part of a ring fence. He may secure a tank</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a well or two; but on the other hand the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">may at first be-waterless. So the new settler must</seg><seg type="columnLine">hustle into fencing, tank or well sinking, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">erection of a house and some steading. The princi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pal advantage he has in this country over the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who takes up virgin acres is that the native grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">and herbage are well established because the timber</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been killed in part, and these respond to a mod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erate rainfall with a lively growth of healthy feed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore the place can be stocked up immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately, and a'lambing and a clip of wool may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected in the first year of occupation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The operations in making a home, in subdividing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the holding, securing a water supply, breaking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a paddock with a plow, and raising wheat or oats, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">hay and grain for his horses, establishing a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">herd of milkers for the family supply of milk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">butter, will be simple enough to an experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">stockman coming from the old country. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most urgent jobs are completed, a vegetable garden</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a small orchard are added to the supplying</seg><seg type="columnLine">areas. When the new man in Australia reaches this</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage, he is beginning to settle down to the comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able life of a landed proprietor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among the leading stock agents of this country</seg><seg type="columnLine">are: Dalgety &amp; Co., Ltd., Sydney; the Cooperative</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wool and Produce Co., Ltd., Sydney; the New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Co., Ltd.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with head offices in New Zealand and branches all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Australia; Chisholm &amp; Co., Sydney; Cramsey</seg><seg type="columnLine">&amp; Lithbridge, Ltd., Sydney; Hill, Clark &amp; Co.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sydney; and Winchcombe Carson, Ltd., Sydney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are many others, but if you apply to any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these firms you will no doubt get all the information</seg><seg type="columnLine">you require regarding your chances in this industry</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Australia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When you get something for nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't make the other fellow pay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">postage on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    A Hotel Built on a Gold-Mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">ALSO some tips about bear-huhting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">A placer mining:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Question:--"A couple of friends recently asked me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to write you for some information on hunting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">placer mining in western Montana.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I spent a few weeks in the old Virginia Creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">diggings, but know nothing of any place that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suit them.
